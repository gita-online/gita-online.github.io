Since the unmanifest <i>atma</i> or immortal soul exists in an  impreceptible  sub-
atomic form within the bodies of all <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings,  they  are
described as spread upwards and downwards. The attributes are the  modes  of
material nature, the three <i>gunas</i> of <i>sattva</i> or  goodness,  <i>rajas</i>  or  passion
and <i>tamas</i> or ignorance. The pleasurable  experiences  are  the  sprouts  and
desires are the buds. The main  central  root  is  the  divine  resplendence
representing the Supreme Lord  and  the  subsidary  roots  are  the  results
acquired  due  to  following  righteousness  or  unrighteousness.  This   is
described in the Ballava section.

In this ancient <i>asvattha</i> or banyan tree representing material existence  the
<i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all existence as manifestation  of
the Supreme Lord is the primary and central  root.  The  subsidary  root  is
<i>prakriti</i> the material substratum pervading physical existence and the  three
<i>gunas</i> are its attributes. The elements earth, water,  fire,  air  and  ether
are the branches and the leaves  are  the  Vedic  hymns.  The  demigods  who
administer universal management are the smaller branches  and  human  beings
are  the  twigs.  From  adherance  or  rejection  of  the  injunctions   and
prohibitions defined in the Vedic scriptures  do  sweet  and  bitter  fruits
results which are the <i>karmas</i> or reactions to the previous actions   one  has
performed.  Righteous  actions  bestow  pleasant  rewards  and   unrighteous
actions  bestow  unpleasant  rewards.   This  ancient  banyan  tree  rewards
liberation and bondage as well depending upon  the  merit  of  righteousness
enacted. It also has fruits, branches and roots that are unmanifest as  well
as those that are apparent and manifest.  This does not  otherwise  come  to
happen neither does it not come not to happen. This means that the cause  is
enveloped in the effect and that the effect  is  containing  the  cause.  In
this way as a tiny seed contains an entire tree and a tree contains  a  tiny
seed the roots and the branches are intertwined eternally.
