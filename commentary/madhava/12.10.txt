Knowledge  is  superior  to  performance  of  an  activity  without   proper
knowledge. Still better  is meditation with  divine  knowledge  rather  than
mere knowledge by itself. In the  Abhimlan  section  of  the  Sama  Veda  is
stated: Better is divine knowledge  then  mere  meditation.  Better  is  the
meditation associated with  divine  knowledge  rather  then  mere  knowledge
alone because from this comes <i>atma tattva</i> or realization  of  the  soul  and
the Supreme peace. Along with meditation <i>karma-phala-tyagas</i> or  renunciation
of the rewards of actions, is also praised and  is  essential  to  spiritual
success otherwise one would not  be  qualified.  So  divine  knowledge  also
associated with renunciation is  also  recommended.  But  superior  to  even
renunciation of the  rewards  of  actions  is  complete  equanimity  to  all
actions. So wisdom is the determining factor for the method implemented  and
is naturally based on qualification and level of  development.  Renunciation
has been expounded upon in previous chapters but now it is being  elucidated
as an adjunct with meditation. The Gaupavana  section  states:  Superior  to
meditation without renunciation  is  meditation  with  renunciation.  It  is
logical that the importance of  renunciation  should  be  deemed  worthy  of
application to meditation for  superior  to  meditation  with  knowledge  is
meditation  with  knowledge  exhibiting  renunciation  of  the  rewards   of
meditation for this leads to  complete  equanimity  regarding  all  actions.
Otherwise it could never be possible to achieve peace of mind if one  failed
to renounce the desire for results and was always hankering for rewards  and
this is what is being  affirmed  by  Lord  Krishna.  The  Kashayana  section
states:  Superior  to  meditation  with  knowledge  is   non-attachment   to
performing actions for rewards  and  the  renunciation  of  the  rewards  of
actions coupled with <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive devotion to the Supreme Lord.   Not
by renunciation  alone  is  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material  existence
possible neither is it possible by meditation  with  renunciation.  It  only
manifests when they both are in association with <i>bhakti</i> to the Supreme  Lord
Krishna through the medium of the spiritual master  from  one  of  the  four
authorised <i>sampradayas</i> or empowered  channels  of  disciplic  succession  as
revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures.  Otherwise  it  would  be   like   praising
renunciation and meditation by themselves and that is not  correct  for  the
reality is that only by <i>bhakti</i> is success guaranteed.  An  example  is  that
in battle soldiers fight for the kingdom and win the war but the success  is
deemed attributed to the efforts of the king alone, <i>bhakti</i> is like this.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
One who exclusively propitiates the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  considering  all
other gods as merely aspects of His potencies and thus  subservient  to  Him
are  known  as  undeviated  and  undistracted.  Lord  Krishna  has   already
confirmed that the rewards solicited from all other gods are only  temporary
and not eternal because they themselves are not  on  the  eternal  platform.
Here a query might arise regarding the worship of Sri Laxsmi because she  is
so inseparable from the Supreme Lord and now this doubt  will  be  specially
clarified. When one offers  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to  the
Supreme Lord by <i>japa</i> or chanting  His  holy  names  or  by  prayers,  or  by
worship or by singing and praising  His  glories  etc.  Then  it  should  be
understood that these activities are initiated from  within  by  Sri  Laxsmi
for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. When  one  firsts  worships  other
gods and then worships the Supreme Lord it should be understood  that  there
is an acute lack  of  <i>bhakti</i>  and  while  pleasing  to  other  gods  is  not
acceptable by Sri Laxsmi for it was not performed for the   satisfaction  of
the Supreme Lord even if one offers the Supreme Lord  the  complete  rewards
received for worshipping the demigods. The activity may be big or small  but
the Supreme Lord only accepts it if the intention is 100% for His  exclusive
satisfaction alone.  So  in  conclusion  all  one's  activities   should  be
intended as an offering to the Supreme Lord  because  from  such  activities
realization dawns and renunciation of  the  rewards  of  action  arises  and
liberation from material  existence  manifests  and  the  Supreme  peace  is
attained.
