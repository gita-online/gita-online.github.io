<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>

Arjuna is now speaking beginning with the words: <i>senayor ubhayor.</i> By  saying
O <i>Acyuta</i> meaning infallible, Arjuna  addresses Lord Krishna as the  one  who
is never contrary to His inherent  qualities of affection for  His  devotees
and His Supreme Majesty and so he states thus being  guided  by  those  very
qualities place my chariot as I have instructed.
<p>
The reason for placing the chariot as instructed is being explained  by  the
verse beginning: <i>yavad etan.</i> The Kauravas  are  only  desirous  of  war  not
peace and externally appear unmoved  by  trepidation.  One  might  say  that
Arjuna is a warrior not a spectator, so what is  the  necessity  of  viewing
the enemy? The answer to this is that  since  the  battle  is  taking  place
between relatives, Arjuna desires to see just what friends have  joined  the
ranks of the enemy that he will have to fight. If it is argued that  out  of
friendship these friends seeing him would want to make a truce,  the  answer
is given by the verse beginning with: <i>yotsyamanan</i>  meaning  they  have  only
come to fight.
