The attributes of nature are those that are  abducted  by  the  senses  thus
delusion arises and the conception of false ego enjoying the  sense  objects
impels a reaction.  Lord  Krishna  uses  the  word  <i>guna-karmasu</i>  means  the
reactions from actions influenced by the  modes  of  goodness,  passion  and
nescience. Auditory and visual sense objects capture the  attention  of  the
senses being the ear and eye respectively and bring like or dislike  to  the
mind. It should be understood that the impulses that  come  from  the  sense
objects are secondary attributes and they have reactions  and  bind  one  to
<i>samsara</i> the cycle of birth and death.
