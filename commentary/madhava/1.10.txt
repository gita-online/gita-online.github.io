Now the question arises that if the armies  on  both  sides  were  equal  in
might, how is it possible that victory  is  assured?  Duryodhana  gives  the
answer in this verse by using the word <i>aparyantam</i>  in  the  sense  of  being
unlimited. Duryodhana  to  conceal  his  fear  exclaims  that  his  army  is
unlimited and moreover they  are  protected  by  Bhishma  who  is  the  most
intelligent and a <i>maha-ratha</i>; whereas the Pandava army  protected  by  Bhima
of less intelligence  is  limited.  This  is  why  the  Kaurava  victory  is
assured.
