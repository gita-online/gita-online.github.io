Lord Krishna explains a manifestation of His divine form. Due  to  the  <i>atma</i>
or immortal soul although distinctly different is similar in quality to  the
Supreme Lord it is sometimes spoken  of  as  a  partial  manifestation.  The
Supreme Lord when enveloping the physical body, energises  the  five  senses
and  activates  the  mind  relative  to  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum
pevading physical existence. The statement that the  mind  is  drawn  toards
sound may give rise to the misnomer that  the  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being  is
independent. Lord Krishna clarifies this in the very next verse..
