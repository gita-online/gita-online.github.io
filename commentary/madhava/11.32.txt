Whoever severs Jayadratha's head from his body causing it  to  fall  on  the
ground will instantly have their own head burst into pieces.  Thus  one  who
slays him is also in the mouth  of  death  and  that  is  why  his  name  is
specially mentioned as this was a boon given to him  by  his  father.  Karna
has special power given to him by a weapon from Indra  that  will  slay  any
one it strikes but only can be launched once, Bhishma has the boon  that  he
will die only at the time he so desires and Drona cannot be defeated by  any
weapon  receiving  the  boon  of  knowledge  of  every  weapon  and  how  to
neutralise them from the <i>avatar</i> or incarnation Parasurama  Himself.  But  by
the express desire of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  they  all  will  certainly
perish on the battlefield and Arjuna and the Pandavas will be victorious.
