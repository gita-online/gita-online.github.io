In how many ways is this to be understood? Endlessly, not limited by  space,
eternal, indestructible. It can not be destroyed  by  curses  or  magic  and
while being unable to be destroyed is also immutable.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Thus it is stated in the Maha Varaha Purana:
<p>
Even though the soul within the physical body  of  every  living  entity  is
eternal and even though in all respects the use  of  the  word  tu  confirms
that  eternity  refers  only   to   Lord   Krishna   alone,   the   temporal
transmigration  of  bodies,  feeling  pain,   incompleteness,   these   four
attributes of destruction are never spoken as  referring  to  Lord  Krishna.
However in relation to all other things there surely is a result in loss.
<p>
Thus is stated in the Parama Sruti:
<p>
Attributes are threefold: relating to time, relating to place and  to  being
complete in themselves. All these attributes are residing fully only in  the
Supreme Lord Krishna exclusively.
<p>
