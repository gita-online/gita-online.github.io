Lord Krishna is declaring that actions do not bind Him as He has no  desires
to the rewards of any actions. This is not to imply that He  does  not  want
the best for creation but only He  is  equipoise  to  <i>prakriti</i>  or  material
nature. Even though the Supreme Lord wills the creation into  existence  and
always is the protector of <i>dharma</i> or eternal righteousness and  out  of  His
causeless mercy has the best wishes for its development He is  not  attached
to it. This knowledge of this attribute of the Supreme  Lord  removes  one's
own misconceptions of attachment and craving for rewards to the point  where
one's desires are not binding  by  performing  prescribed  Vedic  activities
exclusively. In this way a person of  Vedic  knowledge   so  inclined  would
able to attain <i>moksa</i> or freedom from the cycle of birth  and  death.  It  is
not that <i>moksa</i> comes to everyone automatically in  due  course  of  time  in
that case  the  whole  world  would  be  attaining  liberation  without  the
prerequisite knowledge. Therefore one   should  realise  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul
within the heart by knowledge in the mind. By this eternal life is  achieved
by the spiritually wise. How is this eternity to be understood? As the  <i>atma</i>
is without beginning or ending ,  <i>kala</i>  or  time  is  without  beginning  or
ending.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
To emphasise the distinction between Lord Krishna and other living  entities
He twice uses the word <i>mam karmani</i> meaning actions do not bind  Me  and  <i>mam</i>
<i>abhijanati</i> meaning one who knows Me in truth.
