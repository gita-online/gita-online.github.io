<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>

Dhritarastra although  blind  at  birth  was  born  with  an  inner  eye  of
knowledge; but due to being overly affectionate and attached to his sons  he
lost the knowledge of righteousness and thus he was worrying that  his  sons
might return half of the kingdom to  the  Pandavas  who  were  the  rightful
heirs.

Sanjaya who was righteous by nature could  understand  the  actual  internal
mood of Dhritarastra; but to appease his anxiety that his sons  would  never
give back half of the  kingdom  he  said  this  verse  beginning  <i>drstva  tu</i>
<i>pandavanikam  vyudham.</i>..the  soldiers  of  the  Pandavas  are  in   military
formation. The initiative taken by Duryodhana in approaching  his  preceptor
in archery, the master bowman Drona shows that  internally  he  was  feeling
fearful at the sight of the Pandavas might. So with the  pretence  of  going
to offer respect, he approached Drona to conceal this fear.  The  word  <i>raja</i>
meaning king indicates that Duryodhana was very expert in the  diplomacy  of
politics and the use of the word <i>vacanam</i> implies that he would  speak  terse
sentences filled with heavy import concerning the subject of war.
