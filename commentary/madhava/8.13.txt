Except through the <i>Brahmanadi</i> which is one of the 100 nerve centers  in  the
crown of the head; if the life force of a <i>jiva</i> or living  entity  exits  the
body by any of the other 99 nerve centers  it  gets  diverted  and  recycled
back into <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death  without  attaining
<i>moksa</i> or liberation. Both the Vedic scriptures Vyasa Yoga and  Moksa  Dharma
are specify that when <i>jivas</i> exits through the eyes they go to the sun,  when
they exit  through the ears or any of the 99 centers they go  to  the  place
that corresponds with it but they all remain in the  physical  manifestation
and do not lead to the spiritual plane as does the <i>Brahmanadi.</i>The word <i>hrdi-</i>
<i>nirudhya</i> means confined to the heart and denotes meditating on the  <i>atma</i>  or
soul and the Supreme Lord Krishna.  The  Padma  Purana  states:  Because  He
attracts He is in the  hearts  of  all  <i>jivas</i>  and  attracts  them   towards
Himself, He is known as <i>Hrdi</i> the heart. When the life force is stationed  in
the head it is not possible to abide in the heart.  The  Vyas  Yoga  states:
Wherever the life force abides that is where the  <i>jiva</i>  and  the  mind  also
abide. Thus only the one who has prepared themselves throughout their  lives
in proper mediation is able to concentrate in equanimity and is  fully  able
to be in equanimity. This is the purport.

As  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  symbolised  by  the  one  word  <i>OM</i>  His
personalised  transcendental  sound  vibration,  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence is also known by the one word <i>OM.</i>
