Eating foods that are of <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness  are  pleasurable.
Joyfulness is the immediate result. Whatever continues to be pleasurable  is
joyous to <i>hrdya</i> the heart. Even if all foods are cooked they all do not  get
digested the same. Ghee and honey  are  absorbed  into  the  body  directly,
fruits take an hour to digest and vegetables and grains  up  to  six  hours.
Some foods although bitter are agreeable to health such as <i>kerala</i> or  bitter
melon and some foods although sour like yoghurt are agreeable to  health  if
not taken at night. Both of these are of <i>sattva</i> or  goodness<i>.</i>  Such  is  the
nature of the pious and the saintly and that nature  is  maintained  by  the
intake of foods that are <i>sattva.</i> The Shabda Niranya states: <i>Hridyam</i> is  that
which is pleasing to the heart and makes one desire for  more.  Pleasure  is
what is  pleasing  for  the  moment.  <i>Sukham</i>  or  happiness  is  that  which
continues to keep one joyous long after the activity has  ended.  That  food
which retains its agreeability even after  consuming  repeatedly  is  <i>rasyam</i>
which is delicious and nutritious.

But when foods are excessively bitter, spicy,  salty.  sour,  pungent,  etc.
and result in discomfort and misery  culminating  in  sickness  and  disease
they are of <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion. The  food  which  is  eaten  more
than three hours after it is cooked is known as <i>yatama.</i>  When  the  food  is
tasteless it is also called <i>yatayama.</i> Food  that  once  was  flavourful  but
later becomes later has no taste is known as  <i>gatarasyam.</i>  The  Suddhasastra
states that one devoted to serving the Supreme Lord Krishna or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations should thoroughly understand the nature and  quality
of food.
