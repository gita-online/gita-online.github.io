One may wonder how are all sorrows  destroyed  on  attaining  the  state  of
satisfaction? Lord Krishna explains that by achieving tranquillity  of  mind
the intellect becomes established in connecting  to  the  ultimate  reality.
Prasade indicates that by the mercy of the Supreme Lord one neutralises  the
tendency to gravitate towards experiencing  objects of the senses.
