The word <i>sthane</i> means most appropriate. The moon, the sun and fire  are  all
Lord Krishna's <i>vibhuti</i> or divine  transcendental  opulence  and  their  rays
attract the senses of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings  and  enthral  them  all
over creation. In this way He  is  being  addressed  as  <i>Hrisikesha</i>  or  the
controller of the senses. The characteristics of the rays  are  directed  by
the projection of the light. The evidence is seen  in  Moksa  Dharma  wwhich
having stated that sun and the moon are like His eyes, the  presiding  power
of His divinity over the mind and senses is obvious,  especially  as  He  is
manifesting as <i>caitanya</i> or the life force within all  living  beings.  Other
statements such as: My senses will  not  succumb  to  unrighteous  behaviour
support this as well. In the Moksa Dharma Lord Krishna states: Even  through
His hair are the sun, moon and fire projected into <i>prakriti</i> or the  material
substratum pervading all physical existence.  Into  trillions  of  universes
these suns and moons are projected appearing like rays in the  firmament  to
energise and protect,  each  rising  and  setting  according  to  the  times
allotted them. By such instruction and protection all  creation  is  pleased
and by such benevolent activities of unlimited suns and moons  He  is  known
as  <i>Hrisikesha</i>  the  origin  of  creation  and  the  ultimate   granter   of
benedictions.
