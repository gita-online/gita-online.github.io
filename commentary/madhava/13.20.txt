According to variegated differences of qualification, methods of  perception
for varying humans have been prescribed differently. For a  devotee  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna there is no alternative other than His  mercy  and  His
grace. It is only by the Supreme Lord's desire that one attains Him  and  no
other cause or reason. Some devotees know some things on their own and  some
things they have been taught by others and  still  other  things  they  have
learned from the Vedic scriptures. So in this way they know a  little  about
the Supreme Lord. But to realise Him is  by  His  will  alone.  Only  if  He
sanctions one to attain Him such a one will attain Him.  Such  ones  realise
Him within their purified hearts and others like  Pariksit  saw  Him  within
the womb and others like Narada see Him externally as well.  Having  by  the
grace of the Supreme Lord  become  perfected  in  meditation  upon  Him  and
consolidating knowledge of Him by diligent and uninterrupted  efforts,  they
eventually perceive the Supreme Lord everywhere within  and  without.  Those
who have achieved the perception from meditation no longer need to  meditate
upon Him as He is always within them. These are the followers of  Kapiladeva
known as <i>sankhyas</i> situated in equanimity among whom the  four  faced  Brahma
is the topmost.
<p>
In special cases even the best of the <i>ksatriya</i> or royal  warrior  class  who
engaged Vaisnava Brahmins to perform Vedic <i>yagnas</i> or rituals  to  propitiate
the Supreme Lord have achieved great devotion  and  have  seen  the  Supreme
Lord as in  the  case  of  Emperor  Yudisthira  Maharaj.  Other  kings  from
listening to the Vedic scripture have become enlightened as in the  case  of
King Janaka who bequeathed his daughter Sita directly to  Rama.  Yet  others
still get the mood of devotion to see the Supreme Lord by hearing  excitedly
from others enthusiastically  eulogising  Him.  Still  others  perceive  the
Supreme Lord by  hearing  about  Him  from  others  and  by  reflecting  and
meditating upon His divine pastimes. There is no other  way  to  attain  Him
other then what has been elaborated on here. Beginning with sages and  kings
the power of illumination gradually increases  up  unto  Brahma,  the  first
progenitor  whose  illumination  is  the  greatest  in  material  existence.
Manifested from the navel of Visnu he surrendered fully to Him  and  hearing
the Vedas emanating from His pores began  chanting  them  and  acquired  all
knowledge for creating material existence. Since human  beings  are  endowed
with minimal illumination  they  should  also  be  listeners  of  the  Vedic
scripture. In this way everyone will realise the Supreme Lord in due  course
of time depending upon their capability and competence.
<p>
While for all <i>sravanam</i> or hearing about the Supreme Lord is recommended  for
all it is especially essential for human beings  who  are  less  illuminated
and generally incapable of having direct realisation  in  one  lifetime.  So
because they have to take shelter in the Vedic scriptures  they  are  called
<i>sruti-paryanah</i> or  incline to follow the  Vedic  scriptures.  Whereas  those
due to past life activities have acquired  self-realisation  without  having
to exclusively listen to the Vedic scriptures are not contrary  in  any  way
for such human beings even though born from human wombs should be  known  to
be veritable incarnations of the demigods.
<p>
Any male who can measure from the neck downwards nine times  the  length  of
ones face to the  feet  and  any  female  who  can  measure  from  the  neck
downwards eight times  the  length  of  her  face  to  the  feet  should  be
considered as demigods. As well as  those  male  and  females  whose  bodily
length measures 96 finger widths along with those  whose  two  palms  placed
vertically next to each other measure ten in number  and  those  whose  foot
measurement equals seven in number should also be  considered  as  demigods.
The gradation from the Supreme Lord to the various humans  gets  reduced  in
decreasing order by a measure of five fingers and similarly the  measure  of
the feet also  gets  reduced  until  it  reaches  one  foot.  Regarding  the
demigods the measure gets reduced by four fingers and in regard to the  feet
gets reduced to six feet as in  the  case  of  the  <i>gandarvas</i>  or  celestial
musicians and others. The above mentioned measurements  are  given  for  the
<i>gandarvas,</i> kings and the  higher  evolved  humans  in  the  Vedic  pantheon.
Measurements of less then 87 finger widths puts one amongst  the  <i>asuras</i>  or
demons and the humans destined for hellish destinations. Measurements of  87
finger widths to 92 finger widths are for the higher order  humans  such  as
Yudisthira and Haihaya and the demigods. The measurements  for  incarnations
like Parasurama and Prithu are 92 finger widths to 96 finger widths.
<p>
In accordance to the measure of devotion unto the Supreme Lord  Krishna,  by
His desire every <i>jiva</i> or embodied being  assumes  qualities  and  attributes
similar to Him. This order of gradation predicated upon the  <i>jivas</i>  capacity
for  devotion  being  eternal  is  indestructible.  It  should  be   clearly
understood that this gradation has  nothing  to  do  with  higher  or  lower
births or caste.  This  gradation  has  to  do  with  the  <i>samskara</i>  or  the
fundamental impression that the <i>jiva</i> was influenced by when it entered  into
material existence. One may be born into knowledge and breeding and  exhibit
the qualities of an <i>asura.</i> A perfect example of this  is  the  demon  Ravana
whose intelligence and knowledge <i>dharma</i>  or  eternal  righteousness  was  so
great that Rama sent His younger brother Laksman to learn from  him  on  his
deathbed. Yet and still he  showed  he  was  <i>tamasic</i>  or   in  the  mode  of
ignorance by breaking <i>dharma</i>  and  kidnapping  another  mans  wife.  Another
example of being <i>tamasic</i>  is  Duryodhana  an  <i>asura</i>  born  in  a  family  of
righteous kings and who knew what is for and against <i>dharma</i> still  opted  to
perform sinful activities that went against <i>dharma.</i> Contrarily we  find  the
great devotee Prahlad who possessed innate <i>sattva</i> or mode  of  goodness  was
born  in  a  family  of  demons  and  his  father  was  the   <i>tamasic</i>   king
Hiranyakasipu who was so powerful he even defeated the  demigods  and  ruled
them. Prahlad was such a great devotee of the Supreme Lord that the  Supreme
Lord manifested Himself as Narasinghadeva the half  man  and  half  lion  to
save His devotee and promote him to Vaikuntha the eternal spiritual  worlds.
This is because Prahlad was in <i>sattva</i> the mode of goodness and no amount  of
<i>tamasic</i> demoniac influence could subvert or distort his innate  <i>samskara</i>  as
a devotee of the Supreme Lord. 
<p>
So  in  conclusion  it  can  be  understood  that  such  gradations  are  in
accordance to innate devotion to the Supreme Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations as revealed in the Vedic scriptures from the  moment
one entered into the plethora  of  material  existence.  This  understanding
should be reflected upon deeply and contemplated intensely  so  that  proper
comprehension is derived even if at first it appears incomprehensible.
