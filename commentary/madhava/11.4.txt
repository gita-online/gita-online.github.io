Hari Om!  In  this  verse  the  manner  in  which  Lord  Krishna's  powerful
universal form may be meditated upon along with the details of the  form  is
being requested. The word <i>prabho</i> means  Supreme  master,  one  who  is  most
powerful and capable. In the Moksa Dharma  it  is  also  mentioned  as  such
stating: There is no one more powerful then the Perennial Supreme Lord.  The
word <i>prabhu</i>  is  specifically  referring  to  the  Supreme  Lord,  the  most
powerful.
