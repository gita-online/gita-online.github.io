When a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being due to the mercy  of  the  Vaisnava  spiritual
master, attains the auspiciousness of <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving  devotion
unto the Supreme Lord Krishna at that  time  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself  as
<i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul inconceivably resides simultaneously  within  the
etheric heart of every <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being  commences  to  direct  the
actions of that blessed disciple of His  servitor,  the  Vaisnava  spiritual
master, who guides and instructs through his  words  and  actions.  Although
the Supreme Lord is continuously entering and departing each and every  womb
along with every <i>jiva</i> and <i>atma,</i> he does not desire any recompense for  this.
In the Moksa Dharma known also as the Mahabharata it is stated: Even  though
the <i>jiva</i> witnesses the temporal emotions,  merits  and  demerits  and  knows
what is ultimately beneficial it is powerless to oppose  them.  Even  though
moving hither and thither to the four corners of the planet,  enjoying  here
and suffering there, all actions  are  actually  energised  by  the  Supreme
Lord. Even when conquering and winning if one considers themselves  a  great
personality, factually they are only performing as ordained by  the  Supreme
Lord. Even as a vehicle controlled by someone moves  a  passenger  from  one
location to another. In the same manner  the  <i>jiva</i>  transmigrates  from  one
body to another controlled by the potency of the Supreme Lord.
