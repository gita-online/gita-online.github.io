The Anabhimian scripture states that those  unfortunate  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings who oppress and chastise the  Resplendent  Supreme  Lord  who  dwells
within as <i>Paramatma</i> the supreme soul which resides within the etheric  heart
of every living entity in existence  are  of  miniscule  consciousness  with
meager perception. Thus without the vision of perception  they  oppress  Him
within their hearts and the hearts of others. The word <i>asura</i>  means  without
light and is in general referred to those of the demoniac nature. Those  who
are void of light are void of light perception and also void  of  the  light
of perceptivity. The Agniveshya scripture states  that  those  endowed  with
the divine nature are exclusively in <i>sattva guna</i> or  the  mode  of  goodness
and study the Vedic scriptures and are  receptive  to  Lord  Krishna.  While
those that are of the demoniac nature are a  combination  of  <i>raja  guna</i>  or
mode of passion and <i>tama guna</i> or mode of ignorance and they never study  the
Vedic scriptures and even if by chance they get an opportunity to hear  from
them they cannot fathom  the  values  contained  therein  because  they  are
inimical to the Supreme Lord.
