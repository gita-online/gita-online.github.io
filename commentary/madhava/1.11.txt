<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>
<p>
If Drona becomes indifferent understanding the  implications  of  negligence
hidden  in  these  words  my  purposes  will  be  hampered.  Thinking   this
Duryodhana assured him of his confidence in his ability  by the use  of  the
word <i>ayanesu</i> indicating prowess<i>.</i>  You  all  being  divisioned  at  strategic
points in your various military formations should not leave  your  positions
for you all must carefully protect Bhishma from both sides and behind as  he
will be so engaged in the overall  battle  he  may  not   be  aware  of  his
immeadiate surroundings<i>.</i> If he is protected properly  then  our  victory  is
assured. Duryodhana's intimation was that  Bhishma  is  my  grandfather  and
Drona is my preceptor thus both must be my well-wisher and this was  already
proven in the royal assembly during the game  of  dice  with  the  Pandava's
when neither Bhishma or Drona responded to the overt  indiscretions  against
Draupadi; even though they both could see the  injustice  and  transgression
that she was subjected to by Duryodhana.
