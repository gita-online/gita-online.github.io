Renunciation is being praised and is beneficial for all humanity  regardless
of status or class. But merely renouncing actions  is  not  sufficient.  For
those enlightened by the light  of  spiritual  wisdom  and  those  aspirants
serious about <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material  existence  the  desire  for
any rewards in the performance of  prescribed  Vedic  activities  have  been
completely abandoned. For them  the  only  goal  is  the  eternal  bliss  of
attaining communion with the Supreme Lord  which  is  their  hearts  desire.
Such enlightened ones perform activities not  for  the  expectation  of  any
rewards but out of compassion for the benefit of  all  created  beings.  The
word <i>sannyasinam</i> means totally renounced and this  denotes  that  one  never
performs activities associated with desire even if they are for the  benefit
of others. Such sannyasi's or celibate monks in the  renounced  order  along
with  sages,  ascetics,  rishi's  and   paramahamsa's   who   have   already
surrendered everything to the Supreme Lord are  no  longer  associated  with
desires as is a normal human being and thus they take  action  by  inaction.
They have terminated all <i>karma</i> or reactions to actions and have  transcended
<i>samskara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death. They exist aloof  from  the
world both internally and externally and wholly devote  themselves  to  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the immortal  soul  and  inner  meditation  on  the
Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  and  expansions
as revealed in Vedic scriptures.
