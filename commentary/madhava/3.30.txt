The words <i>adhytma-cetasa</i> means in one's mind offer  all  actions  within  to
<i>paramatma</i> or the supersoul of the  Supreme  Being.   Here  Lord  Krishna  is
giving the conclusion by instructing that one should  dedicate  all  actions
to Him alone eradicating all deluded concepts that one is the  doer  of  any
actions. <i>Sannyasya</i> means renouncing all activities that  are  not  dedicated
to the Supreme Being. The word <i>nirmamah</i>  means  without  any  ego  sense  of
attachment. Those situated in the spiritual wisdom  of  the  Vedas  dedicate
all their actions as well as their thoughts  to  <i>paramatma</i>  within,  without
attachment.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The <i>jivas</i> or the subatomic living entity existing  as  consciousness  within
every living being is certainly not the doer  of  any  action.  The  Supreme
Lord Krishna through the medium of <i>prakriti</i> or material nature is the  doer.
<i>Yagna</i> or worship adoring Him is verily the essence of all actions. Even  the
<i>yagna</i> offered to Him is only possible His mercy  and  grace  alone  and  not
otherwise.  Devotion to the Supreme Lord is its  own  reward  and  bequeaths
His mercy and grace perpetually. Performance of <i>yagna</i> to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna is exclusively the ordained activity to be performed for  all  human
beings, as well as to any of  His  authorised  incarnations  such  as  Rama,
Vishnu or Narasimhadeva as  revealed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures.  Only  the
Supreme Lord alone is an independent performer of actions.  All  beings  are
impelled by Him but He is impelled by nothing. Dependence upon Him  and  Him
alone is the ordained action. The actions of  the  <i>jivas</i>  are  fraught  with
modifications due to being constantly influenced by the <i>gunas</i> known  as  the
modes of goodness, passion and nescience. It is stated in the  Brahma  Tarka
that one should always understand the  performance  and  non-performance  of
actions as differentiated between the Supreme Lord, the <i>jiva</i>  and  <i>prakriti.</i>
In the Shabda Nirnaya <i>prakriti</i> or material nature is  to  be  understood  in
some instances as the <i>jivas</i> inclination, in other  instances  as  the  <i>gunas</i>
and yet in special cases because of His creation potency  the  Supreme  Lord
Himself can be  so  understood.  By  inclination  the  <i>jiva</i>  is  three  fold
consisting of the best, the worst and the intermediate.  The  best  are  the
<i>devas</i> or demi-gods, the worst are the <i>asuras</i> or demons and  the  humans  are
intermediate.  There  will  never  be  any  change  in  the  disposition  or
modification in the inclinations of any of the three. The <i>devas</i> will  always
act noble and godly, the demons will always  act  ignoble  and  ungodly  and
humans will always show qualities vacillating between both. Some humans  due
to receiving spiritual association will exhibit the noble qualities  of  the
<i>devas</i> and other  humans  receiving  degraded  influences  will  exhibit  the
ignoble qualities of the <i>asuras.</i>
<p>
The <i>jivas</i> who are <i>devas</i> are qualified  for  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  the
cycle of birth and death, the <i>jivas who are</i> intermediates are qualified  for
primordial life and the <i>jivas</i> who are <i>asuras</i> are only qualified for  eternal
darkness. The redemption of each is achieved only by  each  following  there
positive inclination. In the absence of a positive inclination the  path  of
the three continues endlessly. Because there is eternal  continuity  in  our
primordial world by the will of Lord Krishna  the  cycle  is  endless.   The
knowledge of the <i>asuras</i> who are degraded is always distorted. The  knowledge
of the mortal human intermediates is mixed, influenced by the  three  <i>gunas.</i>
The knowledge of the essential  principles  and  conclusions  of  the  Vedic
scriptures and devotion for Lord Krishna is reserved for the  demi-gods  and
the higher order of human beings  such  as  Vaisnava's  and  brahmana's  and
liberated yogis.
<p>
All <i>jivas</i> being subservient to the Supreme  Being  each  perform  activities
according to their natural attributes. <i>Paramatma</i>  or  the  supersoul  within
monitors the actions performed by every <i>jiva</i>  according  to  each's  natural
inclination. The deluded believe that they are the cause and sole  performer
of all their actions; but those  situated  in  spiritual  Vedic  wisdom  are
aware that the senses are energised by the will of  the  Supreme  Being  and
interact with the three <i>gunas</i> within the  <i>prakriti</i>  totally  dependent  upon
Him<i>.</i> These <i>jivas</i> realising they  have  no  independent  actions  exceedingly
please the Supreme Being by there devotion.
<p>
The deluded  <i>jivas</i>  by  the  influence  of  their  own  attributes  consider
themselves to be  knowledgeable and independent from the Supreme Being.  The
deluded do not consider that their actions or attributes  are  dependent  on
anything except themselves.   Being  unqualified  by  their  ignorance  they
never become illuminated with the light of wisdom. In  the  Prakasa  Samhita
it is stated : That the deluded of  impure  minds  can  never  conceive  the
truth of the ultimate reality and attain perception  of  the  Supreme  Being
residing within. The deluded possibly could be convinced about it  in  their
minds with strong arguments founded in logic; but never in their  hearts  so
deluded by <i>maya</i> or illusion are they.
