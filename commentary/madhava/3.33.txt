A question may be  raised  that  if  it  is  so  beneficial  to  follow  the
teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita then why  is  not  everyone  following  them.
Lord Krishna explains that it is according to their  own  nature  determined
by  <i>samskaras</i>  or  impressions  from  past  lifetimes  and  because  of  the
influence of <i>prakriti</i> or material nature interacting with the  three  <i>gunas,</i>
or the modes of goodness, passion and nescience.
