It is not only that all creation is dependent upon  Lord  Krishna  but  also
the wonderful phenomena of creation itself  is  a  form  of  His  splendour.
Because of His splendour there is beauty and supremacy as  well  due  to  He
being the established cause, the ultimate enjoyer and the  illuminator.  The
Vedic scriptures  iterate:  That  Lord  Krishna  is  the  all  knowing,  all
performing, all enjoying, all fragrance and all essence. He  is  all  things
that can be seen or thought even though unknowable in words to be  described
by speech. Thus is He eulogised. Creation, preservation and destruction  are
all co-ordinated, orchestrated, energised and illuminated solely by  just  a
fragment of Lord Krishna. Thus have seers and sages praised  Him  throughout
the millenniums. The Narada  Purana  states:  Because  He  is  the  ultimate
enjoyer of all, He is known as <i>sarva</i> or everything and not  because  of  His
universal form. Even the enjoyments of the future are always His.  Therefore
through His inconceivable power all enjoyments are His.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Gross manifestations and consciousness is the lower form of <i>prakriti</i> or  the
material substratum and  subtle  manifestations  and  consciousness  is  the
higher form. Both  are  endowed  with  the  attributes  of  three  <i>gunas</i>  or
goodness, passion and ignorance; but only the subtle higher form is  endowed
with <i>Sri</i> or <i>Laksmi Devi</i> the beloved of the Supreme Lord.  Both  these  forms
are subservient to Lord Krishna and cause all  the  worlds  to  be  created.
Lord Krishna is the father of creation and from His  energy  <i>Sri</i>  being  the
subtle consciousness can be seen as the mother  of  creation.  Energised  by
Lord Krishna's creative potency all creation is manifested through her.
