In these five verses Lord Krishna defines the quintessential  qualities  and
attributes to achieve the means to  fulfil  the  highest  purpose  of  human
existence. Realisation of these  24  essential  principles  means  knowledge
through the experience of living them in conjunction  with  the  injunctions
of the  Vedic  scriptures.  The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  the  object  of
attainment for these essential principles and is the  ultimate  goal  to  be
attained. Realisation through experience  equates  to  imbibing  and  living
these 20 principles. That by  which  things  become  realised  is  known  as
knowledge. Thus knowledge is known to be a means  of  realisation.  Emphasis
on <i>jnana</i> or knowledge is herein given as the goal for self-realisation.
