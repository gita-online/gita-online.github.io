<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present  Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>

<i>Vepathuh</i> means trembling, <i>romaharsah</i> means horripilation,  the  Gandiva  bow
slipping from his hand shows impatience and <i>paridahyate</i> which is burning  of
the skin is a burning of the heart also.
