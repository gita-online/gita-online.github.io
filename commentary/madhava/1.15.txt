<i>Pancajanya</i> is the name of Lord Krishna's divine, transcendental conch  shell
and the other names mentioned are the conch shells  of  the  five  Pandavas.
This signifies that there were many such divine conch shells present on  the
side of the Pandavas but on the side of the Kauravas there were not any  and
so none were mentioned. By  referring  to  Lord  Krishna  as  <i>Hrsikesa,</i>  the
director of everyone's senses it is indicative that with  the  Supreme  Lord
directing their cause victory was certain for the Pandavas. The use  of  the
name <i>dhanajaya</i> for Arjuna meaning conqueror  of  riches  indicates  that  he
would conquer all the wealth by defeating all the rich  and  powerful  kings
arrayed against him on the battlefield  and  with  the  word  <i>karma</i>  meaning
reactions to actions added to the name of Bhima refers to  his  slaying  the
demon Hidamba after he and his mother  and  brothers  were  forced  to  flee
their burning house instigated by Duryodhana and indicates what is in  store
for him in the future.
