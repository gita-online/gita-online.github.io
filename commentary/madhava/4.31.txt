By diminishing the intake of food the influence of the senses are greatly
reduced due to weakness of body. The speech is also so diminished as well.
Knowing that the senses and tongue which governs both eating and speaking
are all subservient to the mind as revealed in the Vedic scriptures, one of
controlled mind should only eat what has been ordained and sanctified in
yagna or offerings of worship to the Supreme Lord according to the
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures otherwise there is no hope for
redemption in this world  or the next.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Due to yagna and propitiation to the Supreme Lord are the restraint of the
senses achieved. By considering that such efforts are the sole purpose of
existence one should wholeheartedly engage in yagna without reservation.
One should consider one's life as the oblation offered to the Supreme Lord
in full surrender following the injunctions recommended in the Vedic
scriptures. In the Brahma Vaivartaka Purana it states that one should
realise the Supreme Lord as the yagna and propitiate Him with body, mind
and words. When the Brahman or the spiritual substratum pervading all
existence has been perceived then the relation between the performer, the
activity performed, the recepient of the performance and the result of the
performance are all factually not separate from the Supreme Lord one will
then experience the actual presence of the Supreme Lord everywhere in all
situations.
