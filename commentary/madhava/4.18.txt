In this verse Lord Krishna delineates the  intricate  and  subtle  forms  of
actions. When a person  performing  <i>karma</i>  or  prescribed  Vedic  activities
resolves with certitude that the action performed is solely for the  Supreme
Lord and not for the  one  performing  the  action  whose  consciousness  is
merely  a  minute  reflection  of  the  ultimate  consciousness  then   does
realisation begin to dawn within and all actions performed  by  such  a  one
are factually inaction. Then one realises that  all  actions  performed  are
actually performed by the Supreme Being Himself in  the  same  consciousness
as when the Supreme Reality even  creates  the  universes.  This  person  is
spiritually intelligent and situated in true wisdom, for such  a  person  is
verily in communion with  the  Supreme  Consciousness  and  even  when  this
person is not performing any actions, such a person should be understood  to
be performing all actions and the knower of all actions.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<i>Karma</i> or actions are the nature of all living beings. This is  because  they
are not the actual performer of any action  and  are  dependent.  <i>Akarma</i>  or
inaction is the nature of the Supreme Lord because of His being  independent
and the factual performer of all actions. The  living  beings  accept  <i>karma</i>
and reactions to actions when egoism is present in the belief  that  one  is
the doer or thinks that the actions were performed by them.  In  the  Narada
Purana it states that since the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  never  bound  by
cause and effect all His actions are to be understood as  inaction.  In  the
Pancharatra it is noted that the word <i>krtsna</i> has the attribute of not  being
perceptible in regards to activities. This  denotes  that  all  actions  are
under the control of the  Supreme  Lord.  Since  all  material  actions  are
visible to the living beings, what is not visible is the <i>karma</i> or  reactions
that come with the actions that the living beings are forced to  accept  due
to having desires for the  rewards  of  their  actions  and  this  perpetual
desire to enjoy causes tem to perform actions which keeps them attached.
