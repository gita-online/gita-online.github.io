Lord Krishna now gives the method of renouncing desires.  Restraining  one's
mind and body by the conscious of the <i>atma</i> or  soul  which  is  referred  to
here denotes not being dependent. By renunciation of the senses one  becomes
devoid of pride. One who is convinced that the  Supreme  Lord  performs  all
actions and  that  they  do  not  perform  any  actions  is  free  from  all
reactions.
