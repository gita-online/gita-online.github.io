Now begins the summation.

<p>
<p>
<p>
How renunciation can become the form of equanimity  is  explained  in  these
two verses. Energised solely by the all encompassing  and  pervading  energy
of the Supreme Lord a beings mind and  body  become  active.  The  knowledge
that no being  is  ever  independent  of  the  Supreme  Lord  is  verily  an
essential and eternal truth.
