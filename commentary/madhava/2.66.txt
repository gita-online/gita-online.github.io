In this verse Lord Krishna gives an analogy on the condition  of  those  who
meditate on their senses. One may  ask  the  question,  Do  not  the  senses
perform the activities energised by the Supreme Lord? This  is  only  partly
true because wisdom is an essential ingredient of meditation  and  when  one
is pursuing the senses then wisdom is lost and one is out of control like  a
ship in a storm causing the senses to lose their essential purpose.
