Lord Krishna reiterates that abandoning desire for the  rewards  of  actions
is what is to be relinquished  and  the  true  expression  of  renunciation.
Merely giving up the actions is an erroneous display of foolishness with  no
benefit. The Padma Purana states: Those  who  give  up  the  performance  of
prescribed Vedic activities,  receiving  no  benefits  will  undoubtedly  be
forced to enter the dark and hellish nether worlds.
