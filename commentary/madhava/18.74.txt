Lord Krishna declares that there is  no  human  more  exalted  then  He  who
devotes his life disseminating the teachings of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita to  His
devotees and explains the meaning of  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  to  others.  By
these words the topmost gradation of human beings has been elucidated.  This
applies specially to all human species and specifically to the  demigods  in
the heavenly planets.
<p>
The spiritual potency of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita is so sublime  and  phenomenal
that even by aurally hearing this science  recited  by  a  devotee  of  Lord
Krishna leads to <i>moksa</i> or liberation from  material  existence  and  release
from <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death. Knowledge of  the  <i>atma</i>
or immortal soul and its eternal relationship with  Lord  Krishna  increases
one's individual consciousness exponentially. Even those who  have  achieved
<i>moksa</i> still derive the greatest pleasure  from  listening  to  it  explained
from the mouth of a devotee and those devotees who are imbued  with  a  life
of austerity and devotion it becomes like aural nectar. The demigods in  the
heavenly planets whose minds are greatly enhanced  know  the  entire  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita by memory get immense pleasure from singing  it  as  a  divine
song in the <i>anustup</i> meter consisting of 32 syllables per measure.  Their  is
no greater pleasure or joy then derived from discoursing on Srimad Bhagavad-
Gita's chapters, verses or even half a verse.
<p>
Full body prostrated obeisance unto the Supreme Lord  Krishna,  the  dearest
and most precious of all  that  is  dear  and  precious.  He  alone  is  the
embodiment of all wonderful attributes and superlative qualities, having  no
defects and He bestows <i>nityananda</i> eternal bliss. The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
is endowed with <i>sat</i>  eternal  existence,  <i>cit</i>  unlimited  consciousness  and
<i>ananda</i> or endless bliss. He is always the  recipient  of  glorification  and
worship from  Brahma, Shiva, Laksmi, Surya the sungod, Vayu the god of  wind
and others.
<p>
There have been three forms of Vayu who have  appeared  in  the  last  three
<i>yugas</i> or ages. Their  appearances  are  of  mystical  confidential  context.
First in <i>Treta Yuga</i> was Hanuman the servitor of  Lord  Rama  who  discovered
the whereabouts of Sita-devi and originally  spoke  the  Ramayana  prior  to
Valmiki as well  devastating  the  demoniac  armies  of  Ravana.  Second  in
Dvarpara Yuga was Bhima of the Pandavas who following the commands  of  Lord
Krishna destroyed the demoniac Kaurava dynasty which was inimical to  <i>dharma</i>
or eternal righeouness. Third in <i>Kali Yuga</i> is the sage known as  Madhvacarya
who  put  the  <i>mayavadis</i>  impersonalist  into  flight  by   composing   this
commentary propounding the glorious Srimad Bhagavad-Gita and eulogising  the
Supreme Lord Krishna.
