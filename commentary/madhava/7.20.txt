The compound word <i>hrta-jnanah</i> means one  whose  spiritual  intelligence  has
been diverted by distortion. This is due to their inherent  natures,  innate
attributes and over attraction to sense  gratification.  Being  enslaved  by
cravings they choose a path away from Lord Krishna which looks  most  likely
to grants them their material desires and they  ingratiate  themselves  unto
the demigod of their choice. The Supreme Lord is not  averse  to  those  who
worship the demigods but He makes a distinction between worship to  Him  and
worship to others. The results of worshipping all other  gods  is  temporary
and fleeting because the inherent power invested  in  them  has  limitations
being  only  applicable  to  the  material  worlds;  but  the   results   of
worshipping the Supreme Lord are permanent  and  eternal  because  unlimited
power is possessed by Him
