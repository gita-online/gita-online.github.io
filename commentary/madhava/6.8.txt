Lord Krishna speaks of the benefits of  victory  over  the  senses  in  this
verse. Only one who has succeeded in  controlling  the  senses  will  become
equiposed and  tranquil.  When  the  mind  is  no  longer  inclined  to  the
attraction of sense objects and is turned inward, at that time  one  becomes
qualified  for  enlightenment  and  the  Supreme  Being  magnanimously   and
comprehensively becomes established in the heart. The characteristics  of  a
spiritually enlightened person are being explained. Such  a  person  is  not
bewildered by the dualities such as heat  and  cold  and  perceives  Supreme
Being everywhere. Being  content  within  due  to  the  spiritual  knowledge
acquired, having duly subdued the senses with  the  mind  fully  controlled,
meditation within becomes one's  sole  objective.  The  word  <i>vijnana</i>  means
transcendental knowledge which denotes illumination and realisation. It  has
been said by Shiva himself: That which the common  people  are  aware  about
the Supreme Lord is known as <i>jnana</i> or knowledge and  that  which  the  self-
realised are  transcndentally  aware  of  is  known  as  <i>vijnana.</i>  What  one
realises by hearing and reflecting on the Vedic scriptures  is  <i>jnana.</i>  What
one realises by direct perception  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or  the  eternal  soul  is
<i>vijnana. Vijnana</i> in special persons can also be  transcendental  perceptions
of the Vedic scriptures. One who meditates on the <i>atma</i>  within  assumes  the
qualities of the <i>atma</i> within. A <i>yogi</i> or one perfecting the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness is in equanimity in all activities. The word <i>yuktah</i> denotes  a
yogi who is in communion with the ultimate consciousness. Constant  in  such
consciousness without any wavering such a person  remains  immersed  in  the
<i>atma</i> with complete equinimity.

Now begins the summation.

<p>
At all times and in  all  situations  the  awareness  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna being the controller, maintainer and energiser of  all  creation  is
known as <i>jnana</i> or knowledge. Special realisations  and  illuminations  about
confidential topics concerning Lord Krishna  is  <i>vijnana</i>  or  transcendental
awareness. In the Mundaka Upanisad I.I.IV  and  V.  a  distinction  is  made
regarding knowledge. It states that by reading the Vedic  scriptures  it  is
possible to  become  aware  of  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence whereas such <i>jnana</i>  or  knowledge  will  not  bestow
<i>moksa</i> or liberation from the material existence it will lead to  <i>vijnana</i>  or
transcendental knowledge where upon cognisance of the <i>atma</i> and  the  Supreme
Lord.  In conclusion the Vedic scriptures  give  transcendental  perceptions
and illuminations of <i>vijnana</i> when  the Supreme Lord Krishna or  any  one  of
His authorised incarnations is the goal to be realised  and  when  not  they
merely bestow <i>jnana.</i> The goal of human existence is not to  only  experience
<i>moksa</i> but to eternally perform activities in communion with Him.
