The objective and goal to be gained is given here by Lord Krishna. The  <i>atma</i>
or  eternal  soul  residing  within  all  beings  is  the  omnipresent   and
omniscient Supreme Lord. All creatures also exist within  the  Supreme  Lord
as the <i>atma</i> as well. One who perceives this sees the  Supreme  Lord  equally
in everything from a blade of grass to the <i>Brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence. Therefore it  has  been  said  that  one  sees  the
Supreme Lord abiding in all creatures  and  all  creatures  abiding  in  the
Supreme Lord.

<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The Supreme Lord abides in equal measure in all beings along with the <i>atma</i>
or soul and is known as <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul.
