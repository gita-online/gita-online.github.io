Lord Krishna instructs the solution in this verse. That is  to  perform  all
actions free from fruitive craving. Offer all actions to  the  Supreme  Lord
without  desiring  rewards.  Endowed   with   spiritual   intelligence   and
comprehension of reality one attains the supreme stage.  To  get  there  the
performance of actions with equanimity is the  way  to  wisdom  and  is  the
means for assured liberation.
