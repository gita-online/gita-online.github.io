The qualities of a person possessing spiritual intelligence  are  delineated
in the subsequent verses.  The word <i>antararamas</i> means one who enjoys  within
denoting the <i>atma</i> or soul. True happiness is derived through the removal  of
all obstacles and impediments which obstruct access to the <i>atma.</i> Here it  is
alluded to as <i>antar-jyotir</i> or illuminated within.  The  resplendent  Supreme
Lord Krishna Himself is the source of all  illumination  indwelling  as  the
internal light within of all beings as the <i>atma.</i> Even though  all  naturally
created beings have this inner light only those  of  spiritual  intelligence
who are cognisant of it are referred to here.  Those  who  are  situated  in
<i>samadhi</i> or  extreme  internal  meditation  have  no  awareness  of  external
matters. Even by seeing various  activities  in  life  they  are  unaffected
within their consciousness and remain fixed and hence  the  pleasures  which
humans enjoy through the senses such as touching, hearing, tasting  etc.  do
not affect  such  a  person  for  the  pleasure  they  derive  is  from  the
destruction of desires. In the Narada Purana it is stated that:  Since  Lord
Krishna is self luminous His illumination abides  internally  and  thus  the
cause of all internal happiness abides  internally  as  well  starting  with
perception of the <i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all existence.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
Abidance in the <i>Brahman</i> is factual otherwise there  would  be  contradiction
that one has  to  still  reach  the  state  of  the  <i>Brahman.</i>  The  internal
happiness derived is due to one perceiving the <i>Brahman</i> within.
