Actions are born from  the  Vedas  because  the  Vedas  prescribe  <i>yagna</i>  or
worship and appeasement and the performance of <i>yagna</i>  is  done  by  actions.
The Vedas arose out of the breath of the Supreme Brahman. This is  noted  by
the word <i>brahmaksara</i> which means the supreme immutable Vedas which  was  the
medium by  which  the  knowledge  of  the  ultimate  reality  was  revealed.
Otherwise how could the Supreme Brahman which is  inconceivable,  without  a
beginning and an end and complete within Himself ever been known.  The  word
<i>aksara</i> in <i>brahmaksara</i> means the ultimate reality denoting the Supreme  Lord.
When a primary meaning has been identified it is not  proper  to  accept  a
secondary meaning  as  is  often  the  case  due  to  forgotten  traditions.
Insentient objects cannot manifest by themselves they must be  created.  The
magnitude of actions in creation, the unlimited resources  of  elements  and
the awesome manifestation of time indicate inconceivable powers.  Since  the
material worlds are but reflections of the spiritual worlds all  actions  in
material existence emanate outwards with the energy of the Supreme  Lord  as
the source.  This  does  not  directly  include  the  actions  exhibited  by
sentient beings using free will only the  underlying  energy  that  empowers
them.

The word <i>aksarani</i> refers to the eternality of the Supreme Lord. The  eternal
Vedas have Him for their  source.  Because  He  is  eternal  the  Vedas  are
eternal as well. There would be a flaw in anyone  thinking  that  the  Vedas
were created because they could not have been so  without  prior  knowledge.
They are eternally manifest and the Vedic scriptures reveal that  they  were
exhaled by the breath of the Supreme Being. Exhaling is a natural  phenomena
without any effort required indicating that the Vedas  manifested  from  the
spiritual worlds without any conscious effort, this is the  inference  meant
here.

In view of being  eternal  the  statements  of  being  created  have  to  be
understood from the point of view of manifesting within  material  existence
or perception of such not that it was actually created for the  first  time.
An example of this is the treatise <i>Shatapatha  Brahmana</i>  which  is  said  to
have been created by Yagnavalkya. How is it possible for  any  part  of  the
eternal Vedic scriptures to be created by  anyone?  Yagnavalkya  blessed  by
the Supreme achieved a high level of attainment and received it  within  his
mind from the spiritual plane  and  transcribed  it  onto  palm  leaves  for
posterity.

A statement clarified after deliberation is superior to one  spoken  without
contemplation.  The Vedic scriptures are the  source  of  origin,  thus  the
statement in Brahma Sutras I.I.III that the  Vedas  are  the  evidence  that
Brahma is the creator. In the previous verse I.I.II the word <i>janmadyasya</i>  is
used meaning from whom were created is the evidence  which  can  be  quoted.
These verses do not suggest that the Vedas were born  from  <i>Brahman</i>  nor  do
they infer the <i>Brahman</i> was the cause of  the  Vedas.  The  creating  of  the
material worlds by the <i>Brahman</i>  from the five basic elements  given  to  him
of water, earth, air, fire and ether does not preclude the creation  of  the
Vedas nor would it be correct to assume that the  Vedas  were  created  this
way. The creation of a most wonderful world is in no  way  superior  to  the
eternal emanations of the Vedas. This also does not lead to  the  conclusion
that the <i>Brahman</i> is omniscient even though the manifestation  of  the  Vedas
is omniscient. Therefore the eternal Vedas coming from the spiritual  worlds
are themselves the proof and the word <i>aksara</i> confirms this.  So  <i>Brahman</i>  is
revealed through <i>yagna</i> and <i>Brahman</i> is revealed through Vedic scriptures  and
the Vedas eternally establish <i>yagna</i> throughout the material  creation.  From
knowledge of the Vedas and performance of <i>yagna</i> living entities prosper  and
flourish. This is the eternal cycle.
