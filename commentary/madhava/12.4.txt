<p><div align=justify>The original question at the commencement of this  chapter  was  whether  it
was better to directly worship the  Supreme  Lord  by  <i>bhakti</i>  or  excluisve
loving  devotion  or  to  worship  the  impersonal,  unmanifest  <i>brahman</i>  or
spiritual substratum pervading all existence. Herein Lord  Krishna  explains
the difficulties of worshipping the impersonal, unmanifest <i>brahman.</i>
<p>
The path to reaching the unmanifest <i>brahman</i> is  covered  with  difficulties.
The word <i>gati</i> means the path or the way. The path adopted by the  worshipers
of the unmanifest <i>brahman</i> is  very  difficult.  They  must  perform  intense
meditation, rigid  restraint  of  the  senses,  compassion  for  all  living
entities, consistent purity  in  thought  and  actions,  equanimity  to  the
dualities such as censure and praise, joy  and  grief,  pain  and  pleasure,
etc; but to be successful it is essential that  the  grace  of  the  Supreme
Lord is betsowed. But without the grace of His <i>sakti</i> or  spiritual  feminine
potency who is known as Sri Laxsmi and is represented by the unmanifest  the
grace of the Supreme Lord can not be possible and propitiation to her  alone
without Him displeases her and  bequeaths  no  chance  for  realising    the
Supreme Lord and likewise no opportunity for <i>moksa.</i> This  is  true  even  if
she is opulently worshipped. The worship of the unmanifest <i>brahman</i> does  not
focus on a personal form  of  the  Supreme  Lord  possessing  qulaities  and
attributes and by whose grace is  required  to  receive  the  grace  of  Sri
Laxsmi who in turn blesses  the  aspirant  and  bestows  perception  of  the
infinite unmanifest. This is why this path is so difficult.  Yet  and  still
if someone, somehow or other are graced by Sri  Laxsmi  due  to  association
with or service to one of the Supreme Lords devotees, then  facilitation  to
realisation of the Supreme Lord would immediately take effect  and  this  is
the most conducive means to achieve this. Thereafter those who exert  effort
in propitiating the unmanifest <i>brahman</i> will have  the  insight  to  properly
propitiate the Supreme  Lord  as  well  and  directly  receive  the  desired
result.
<p>
In the case of propitiating Sri Laxsmi, if there is any  deficiency  in  the
worship of her or defect in the  aspirant  such  as  rigid  control  of  the
senses, then she may not be pleased and  will  not  bestow  her  grace.  But
regarding the Supreme Lord if anyone approaches  Him  directly  through  the
spiritual master from one of the four authorised <i>sampradaya's</i>  or  lines  of
disciplic succession then He being pleased provides His  devotees  with  all
conveniences and assistance required by His own initiative for  facilitating
their  advancement  to  Him.  In  all  other  cases   and   situations   the
difficulties are unrelenting and increase. This is  evidenced  here  by  the
words <i>kleso'dhikaratas tesam</i> meaning for them tribulations are much more.
<p>
The Sama Veda states in the  Madhuchucanda  section:  That  those  who  have
<i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion for Lord Krishna  have  control  of  the
mind, restraint of the senses, purity of behaviour, equanimity  towards  all
living entities, compassion and  humility.  To  them  alone  is  Sri  Laksmi
elevated position as the eternal <i>sakti</i> of Lord Krishna realised and  not  by
others. Being thus realised Sri Laksmi will grace  these  devotees  of  Lord
Krishna and  the  devotees  of  any  of  His  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and
expansions by meticulously removing all obstacles on their  path  of  <i>bhakti</i>
for Lord Krishna. Subsequently their performance of <i>bhakti</i>  quickly  attains
fruit and without any hindrances they quickly attain communion with Him  and
by His grace attain eternal association with Him in the  immortal  spiritual
worlds.
<p>
Similarly the Sama Veda states in the Ayasya section: That it is  beneficial
to propitiate the Supreme Lord by  propitiating  the  grace  of  Sri  Laksmi
which bestows the grace of the Supreme Lord as well. It  is  not  sufficient
to propitiate Sri Laxsmi separate from the Supreme Lord as then  neither  of
them are pleased and it is by the satisfaction  of  the  Supreme  Lord  only
that she and every other living  being  becomes  eternally  pleased  so  the
proper etiquette must be observed. Following the proper  etiquette  even  if
there was some defect or laxity in such propitiation one would not  fail  to
achieve success  because  Lord  Krishna  is  the  sole  giver  of  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from  material  existence  and  by  performing  actions  for  His
satisfaction everything else because exalted which is not  possible  by  the
strictest worship of the impersonal, unmanifest, <i>brahman.</i>
<p>
The Moksa Dharma quotes a conversation between Lord Krishna and  Sri  Laksmi
where she states: Those who are enthusiastic for <i>moksa</i> will  be  devoted  to
worship of the Supreme Lord and that she is always established in those  who
are  devoted  to  the  <i>sanatan  dharma</i>  or  the  perrennial  principles   of
righteousness, devoted to <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul,  to  those
who have perceived the <i>brahman</i> and to those who  are  truthful,  humble  and
charitable.
<p>
Superior to <i>prakiti</i>  the material substratum underlying  physical  existence
is  the  <i>brahman</i>  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  and
superior to the <i>brahman</i> is <i>atma  tattva</i>  and  superior  to  <i>atma  tattva</i>  is
communion with the Supreme Lord Krishna Himself. The Agnivesya  section  has
clarified the same  stating:  Without  beginning  and  without  end  is  the
<i>brahman</i> etrnally existing and the Supreme  Lord  is  superior  to  even  the
<i>brahman.</i>  Vedavyasa the author of Brahma  Sutra  has  explained  there  that
knowledge of the Supreme Lord alone is the only way to achieve <i>moksa.</i>
<p>
Now begins the commentary.
<p>
Although Vedavyasa has established the  truth  concerning  the  position  of
<i>prakriti</i> in Mahabharata He has rejected  the  ideas  given  in  the  Sankhya
philosophy that the existence of <i>prakriti</i> is independent and He  has  proven
by Vedic statements that <i>prakriti</i> is  totally  dependent  upon  the  Supreme
Lord. Similarly the Saukarayani scripture states:  The  one  with  form  Sri
Laxsmi is dearmost to the transcendental Supreme Lord and the cause  of  the
existence of the worlds. By propitiating Sri Laxsmi  always  in  adjunct  to
the Supreme Lord she becomes very pleased and bestows opulence and  grandeur
upon the propitiator much more expediently than  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself
who is not so inclined to give these things. In  the  subsidary  section  of
the Rig Veda it states: Knowing Sri Laxsmi of golden hue with lotus  flowers
in hands as the Supreme diety  presiding  over  material  nature  enveloping
everything one should propitiate her as the <i>sakti</i> of the  Supreme  Lord.  By
doing so she will grant the sincere  and  knowledgeable  aspirant  splendour
and wealth that would not to be given by the Supreme Lord Himself,
