Lord Krishna is  explaining  that  one  who  perceives  and  recognises  the
Supreme Being in every being is one who actually sees reality. The  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being practically  witnesses  death  and  destruction  in  material
existence everyday along  with  its  associated  misery.  The  Padma  Purana
states that as a form of misery the <i>jiva</i> sees itself; yet devoid  of  misery
is the Supreme Lord residing within  every  <i>jiva</i>  equally  from  Brahma  the
highest material being down  to  an  ant.  The  Supreme  Lord  expansion  as
<i>paramatma</i> or the Supreme Soul within all <i>jivas</i> throughout all dimensions  of
creation  does  not  diminish  or  degrade   His   transcendental   position
whatsoever, whether abiding in a demigod, human, animal etc. Perceiving  the
reality of the Supreme Lord in this way one is not subject to illusion.
