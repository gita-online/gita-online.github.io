Hari OM! The previous six chapters known as the section  on  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or
the science of the individual consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate  consciousness  by  selfless  actions,  the  method  of   acquiring
spiritual wisdom was described. Now the  next  six  chapters  known  as  the
<i>bhakti yoga</i> section or the <i>yoga</i> of devotion primarily describe  the  glories
and  greatness  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  The  words  <i>asakta-manah</i>  means  an
extremely attached mental disposition. Utilising this  attachment  a  person
takes complete shelter of the Supreme Lord understanding that  Lord  Krishna
is the ultimate controller, the ultimate protector and the  ultimate  refuge
of all living entities. Understanding this reality fully with  <i>asamsayam</i>  or
free from doubt without any reservation is the special meaning here.
