In this verse Lord  Krishna  shows  that  for  His  devotees  there  are  no
obstacles  and  impediments  in  their  way  at  all  by  demonstrating  the
alternatives. It has been stated in the Saukarayan scripture: What value  is
the worship of the <i>avyaktam</i> or  the  impersonal  unmanifest  for  those  who
propitiate the Supreme Lord Krishna? Also the Moksa Dharma  also  reiterates
this theme stating: Rejecting all other gods  and  deities,  those  devotees
who perform <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord  Krishna
are indeed the most superior. The  reason  being  that  the  performance  of
<i>bhakti</i> is performed exclusively for the satisfaction  of  the  Supreme  Lord
without any expectation of any  rewards  because  Lord  Krishna  Himself  is
their only goal and attainment of Him is all they desire.
