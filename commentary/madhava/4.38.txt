Lord Krishna praises the value of spiritual wisdom in this verse and the
next two. In this process what is the role of the Supreme Lord? Is He
simply monitoring every activity from His position as paramatma or the
supersoul within all living entities. To the contrary, it is the Supreme
Lord who illuminates the consciousness of the living entities over and over
again and gives them the opportunity to learn about the ultimate truth.
