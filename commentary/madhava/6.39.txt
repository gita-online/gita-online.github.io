Even one who is merely an aspirant seeking the process of yoga or the
science of the individual consciousness attaining communion with the
ultimate consciousness, even such a one will be invariably attracted to
moksa or liberation from the material existence and transcend the
ritualistic ordinances in the Vedas and achieve the Brahman or spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. This is the meaning Lord Krishna is
conveying.

Now begins the summation.

This verse clarifies that even the aspirant seeking the process of yoga is
superior to one who only studies the Vedic scriptures without actual
realisation of them. What is the special need of knowing about being
established in yoga? This was from the Parama Yoga scripture.
