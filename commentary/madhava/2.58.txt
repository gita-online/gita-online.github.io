The attributes of those  who  are  stitha-prajna  situated  in  transcendent
meditation do not manifest without effort. This is  also  explained  in  the
subsequent verses.  By  the  body  abstaining  from  food  and  drink  there
develops a weakness in the body against experiencing  sensual  objects.  But
although the bodily desire is nullified the inner desire to enjoy the  sense
objects remains. Thus the rasa or taste for  enjoyment  is  not  terminated.
Lord Krishna states that this taste can  only  be  terminated  by  spiritual
intelligence  and  by   the   attainment   of   stitha-prajna   transcendent
meditation.  In the Vedic scriptures  it  has  been  stated  that  the  wise
master their  senses  by  abstaining  from  feeding  them.  But  this  verse
illustrates abstinence alone is not  enough  because  even  when  abstaining
attachment to them continues to grow.
