The state of being oblivious and lacking awareness of the  Supreme  Lord  is
caused by Lord  Krishna  Himself.  He  explains  this  by  the  words  <i>maya-</i>
<i>samavrtah</i> meaning concealed by illusory impressions  superimposed  upon  the
mind. All this is done according to His will so the  unqualified  are  never
able to perceive Him. Such foolish mortals cannot fathom that everything  in
their lives and in the total material creation manifests  from  the  Supreme
Lord alone. In the Padma Purana it states that: The Supreme Lord by His  own
internal potency makes Himself concealed from the minds and  hearts  of  the
unqualified through the illusion of His external potency known as the  demi-
goddess <i>Durga-devi</i> also known as <i>Maya-devi.</i>
