<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>

If the question arises that although it is advisable  for  the  Pandavas  to
engage in battle being challenged by their enemies the Kauravas  because  it
is well known that a ksatriya can never decline a challenge to fight  or  to
gamble. To answer this Arjuna speaks the verse  beginning:  <i>yadyapy  ete  na</i>
<i>pasyanti</i> and the verse beginning <i>katham na jneyam asmabhih.</i> The  reason  for
the Kauravas to be engaged in war is out of greed.  Whereas  we  not  having
this desire of greed therefore have no desire for battle. One is engaged  in
karmic activities to fulfil ones desires;  but  only  if  no  negativity  is
created and the action results in  total  happiness  can  it  be  considered
righteousness.

It is also described in the codes of warfare that a <i>Syen Yaga</i> is  prescribed
for killing of ones enemies. Although it is true because the  result  of  it
will not give happiness to  the  family  members  of  the  deceased,  it  is
unreasonable for us to be engaged in this battle.  On  the  other  hand  the
tradition of accepting a challenge by <i>ksatriyas</i> is applicable when there  is
no probability  of  destruction  of  the  dynasty.  Arjuna  again  addresses
Lord Krishna again as  <i>Janardana,</i>  He  who  always  naturally  protects  His
devotees, Arjuna is intimating that since Lord Krishna is the  Supreme  Lord
and has appeared for the express purpose of removing all  those  opposed  to
righteousness on the Earth, He can just by His will destroy all the  enemies
effortlessly Himself.
