The Supreme Lord Krishna now revealed His original human looking  form.  The
<i>visvarupa</i> or divine  universal  form  was  in  effect  a  form  of  illusion
emanating from  His  original  form.  Enough  evidence  for  this  has  been
confirmed  and  attested  previously.  Lord  Krishna  Himself  creates   and
manifests His own forms. For those who are unaware of His original  form  He
does not reveal His <i>visvarupa.</i> He reveals His <i>catur-bhujena</i>  or  four  armed
form as requested in verse 46 to those who are somewhat aware of His  power,
glory and divinity such as the members of the Yadu dynasty  in  Dwaraka  and
the Pandavas. The words  <i>saumya-vapur</i>  mean  gentle  form  and  specifically
denotes His original two-armed form. He especially shows His two armed  form
to those who are unaware that it is His original form  and  the  reason  for
this is so that they naturally interrelate with Him  like  any  other  human
without <i>aisvarya</i> or awe and reverence and openly reciprocate with  Him  from
the heart. The idea of different manifestations  of  Lord  Krishna  original
two armed form being more superior and less superior is only from the  point
of view of those who are deluded. For liberated beings  the  vision  of  the
<i>visvarupa</i> is accessible but the  four-armed  form  is  its  source  but  the
surrendered devotees of the Supreme Lord  understand that the source of  the
four-armed form is the original  two-armed  form  of  Lord  Krishna  and  is
Supreme.
