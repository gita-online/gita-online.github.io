The most munificent and compassionate Supreme Lord Krishna had descended  to
redeem the Earth by giving instruction on  the  knowledge  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul. For this purpose Lord Krishna bewildered His  disciple  Arjuna
and utilised him to  be in illusion  by  unjustifiably  misinterpreting  one
verse found in the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VIII.XV  beginning  <i>ahimsyat  sarva</i>
<i>bhutani</i> meaning: One should not cause injury to any living entity; and  thus
from this verse would come to the erroneous decision that as a  <i>ksatriya</i>  or
warrior  fighting  this  battle  was  against  <i>dharma</i>  the   principles   of
righteousness.

The use of the word <i>Kaunteyah</i> in addressing Arjuna it indicates  that  since
he is the son of Kunti he is affected by the  morality  and  afflictions  of
the mundane world. The use of the word  <i>krpaya</i>  signifies  that  Arjuna  was
naturally compassionate. By the use of the word <i>paraya</i> it is intimated  that
not only for his own  soldiers  was  he  compassionate  but  for  the  enemy
soldiers as well and by the use of the word <i>visidan</i> it  is  expressing  that
all the symptoms of being grief-stricken like shedding of tears,  shivering,
being choked up, etc. have simultaneously  manifested  as  Arjuna  began  to
speak.
