Lord Krishna is praising renunciation of desires in this  verse  emphasising
that one who is capable of being equipoised and resist the onslaught of  the
senses arising from <i>kama</i> or lust and <i>krodha</i> or anger is a  true  renunciate.
He also states <i>iha eva</i> meaning in this very life. If  human beings in  their
life are unable to control their mind and senses and neutarlise the  effects
of <i>kama</i> and <i>krodha</i> then there is  chance  for  them  to  ever  achieve  even
<i>Brahmaloka</i> which is the topmost material planet and where everything  is  in
<i>sattva guna</i> or the mode of pure goodness. The  mastery  of  one's  mind  and
senses is a prerequisite for higher existence.
