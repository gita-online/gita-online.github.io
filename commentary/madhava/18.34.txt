One  who  exhibits  <i>dhriti</i>  or   determination   yet   follows   <i>dharma</i>   or
righteousness in a haphazard way sometimes adhering and  sometimes  opposing
is situated in <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion and one who is so deluded  that
they are unable to discriminate between what is real  and  what  is  unreal,
what is appropriate and what is inappropriate and  what  is  beneficial  and
what is detrimental is situated in <i>tama guna</i> or  mode  of  ignorance.  Fear,
lamentation and dejection which are the indication of delusion  are  the  by
products. Exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord is known  as  <i>bhakti</i>
and is situated exclusively in <i>sattva guna</i> the  mode  of  goodness.  Because
<i>bhakti</i> is transcendental and not mundane it is virtuous and  blissful.  What
is recommended by the Vaisnava's, saintly sages and learned elderly as  well
as  what  is  prescribed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  is  always  considered
undeniably to be situated in <i>sattva guna</i> and whatever is  done  contrary  to
this is in <i>raja guna</i> and whatever repudiates this  in  <i>tama  guna.</i>  This  is
well corroborated in the Bhagavat Purana. The Padma Purana  states  that  by
the grace of the  Supreme  Lord  one  becomes  internally  elated  and  such
elation becomes luminous.
