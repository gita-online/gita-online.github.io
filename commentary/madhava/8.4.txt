The nature which elevates and is useful to all creatures both the  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied  beings  along  with  their  physical  bodies  is  <i>adhibhuta</i>  which
pertains to material nature<i>.</i> Its mutable characteristic is physical  objects
subject to dissolution. The nature of dissolution  is  included  within  the
nature of the unmanifest.  The  Skanda  Purana  confirms  that  the  Supreme
unmanifest merges into space at the time of the end of  creation.  From  the
Supreme Lord  manifested  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  and  from
<i>prakriti</i> arise the three fold <i>gunas</i>  being  <i>sattva</i>  or  goodness,  <i>rajas</i>  or
passion and <i>tamas</i> or ignorance. The modifications of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  are
verily the cause of creation in  the  material  existence.  Because  of  His
abidance as <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul in the  <i>pur</i>  or  city  known  as  the
physical body of all living entities, the Supreme Lord Krishna is  known  as
<i>Purusa</i> the original being. Directing  and  elevating  all  the  330  million
demigods throughout myriad of  universes  He  is  known  as  <i>Sankarsana</i>  the
primal creator and He is Lord of all <i>adhidaivam</i> and the paramount  principle
of divinity.
<p>
Being the ultimate enjoyer of all propitiation and worship He  is  known  as
<i>adhiyagna</i> the goal of all worship and  bestower  of  all  rewards  for  such
worship. Because the offerings of <i>ghee</i> or clarifed butter and <i>havi</i> or  grain
seeds are offered into the sacrificial fire, the demigod <i>Agni</i> in  charge  of
fire is also sometimes called <i>adhiyagna</i> and this is why  Lord  Krishna  uses
the word <i>dehe</i> meaning residing in the physical  body,  which  excludes  Agni
and denotes only Himself, who alone is the exclusive enjoyer of  all  <i>yagnas</i>
and and recepient of all austerities. Those knowers of the  essence  of  the
Vedic scriptures realise the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  paramount  position,
even the intelligent worshippers of other gods  can  comprehend  this  fact.
Humans praise that which grants benedictions, the Supreme Lord  who  is  the
presiding deity of all gods. For whom is the spiritual world permanent?  For
whom is the most meritorious status? To clarify such  queries  Lord  Krishna
clarifies the <i>dharma</i> or eternal righteousness of <i>moksa</i> or liberation.
<p>
Even when it is  established  that  the  resplendent  Lord  Krishna  is  the
ultimate enjoyer of all worship and propitiation answering the  question  of
who; how this is  manifested  yet  remains  to  be  known  and  that  is  by
<i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme  Soul  within  the  heart  of  all  living  entities
monitoring their activities and thoughts as the <i>adhiyagna</i> the  Lord  of  all
worship and propitiation. The  word  <i>atra</i>  meaning  within  is  used  as  an
adjective before <i>dehe</i> meaning  the  body  to  denote  that  it  is  not  His
spiritual body which  He  is  referring  too  but  His  manifested  form  as
<i>paramatma</i>  within  all  sentient  beings.  There  is  nothing   within   the
transcendental spiritual body of Lord Krishna that is separate from  Him  or
different from Him in  any  way,The  <i>brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence is but a fraction of His potency. The  Supreme  Lord
Krishna  is  the  One  to  be  inquired  about  and  realized  through   the
transcendental medium of the  Vedic  scriptures.  To  eliminate  any  doubts
about regarding His absolute  position,  Lord  Krishna  emphasizes  that  He
alone is not only the one  to  be  propitiated  and  worship  but  that  He,
Himself is the <i>adhiyagna</i> in the form of the  indwelling  monitor  witnessing
all activities.
<p>
The Gita Kalpa states: The Supreme Being dwelling within the  physical  body
of all sentient  beings  is  known  as  <i>adhiyagna.</i>  Creation  is  a  natural
propensity of the Supreme Lord. It is the manifestation of His Divine  will.
<i>Adhibhuta</i> is the manifestation of temporary physical forms in the  material
existence. The <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings are  a  manifestation  of  <i>adhyatma.</i>
The Supreme Lord's expansions such as Sankarsana or Hiranyagarbha are  known
as <i>adhidaivam.</i> The Supreme Lord  Krishna  is  the  Lord  of  all  gods  even
Narayana the Lord of the spiritual worlds in Vaikuntha is  an  expansion  of
Lord Krishna. The Skanda  Purana  states:  That  which  is  dwelling  within
exercising complete authority over the <i>atma</i> or  soul  is  called  <i>adhyatmam.</i>
That which is external  and  separate  from  the  physical  body  is  called
<i>adhidaivam.</i> Everything else which is  different  are  the  cause  of  gross,
physical creatures therefore such activity is known as <i>adhibutam.</i>  The  Maha
Kurma Purana states: <i>Adhyatma</i> is that which being  beneficial  to  the  pure
<i>atma</i> or soul extends unto the bodily limit. That  which  becomes  useful  to
the <i>jivas</i> along with their physical  bodies  and  other  gross  elements  is
<i>adhibhutam.</i> Beyond the scope of <i>maya</i> or  illusory  impressions  superimposed
upon the mind which is beneficial to divinity is <i>adhidaivam.</i>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
What was iterated previously is spoken again in this verse for the  sake  of
illuminating the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence.
Because in the fist verse the  adjective <i>tad</i> meaning that is used  in  front
of <i>brahman</i> indicates that it alone is the foundation  of  the  other  terms.
Furthermore when words accompanying <i>yagna</i> are referred to  as  the  elements
inherent in objects which are useful <i>adhibhutas</i>  for  physical  beings  then
such  things  should  be  understood  as  being  beneficial  for   attaining
knowledge and realization of the  Supreme  Lord  exclusively  and  no  other
purpose. Why then should there be any doubt about the <i>brahman?</i> When  it  has
been understood that the source of the imperishable  and  immutable  <i>brahman</i>
is the Supreme Lord  Krishna  alone  all  doubts  are  dispelled.  What  was
iterated previously is being spoken again to  remove  any  doubts  from  the
ignorant and unintelligent. Again for the removal of doubt, those who  think
the unmanifest one is manifest like a normal <i>jiva</i>  also  have  their  doubts
dispelled again as before in chapter VII.XXIV clarified.
<p>
Here is this separate question, that which is immutable  and  unmanifest  is
given for the clarification of the nature of  gradation  of  the  aspirants,
having made  reference  in  verse  three  to  <i>aksaram  paramam</i>  the  supreme
immutable being of Lord Krishna dwelling within the heart  of  all  sentient
beings everywhere. So the paramount position of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
and His authorized  incarnations  and  expansions  has  been  given  exalted
status and the subservience of all other gods has  been  established.  Since
it has been declared  that  Lord  Krishna  that  He  is  both  the  ultimate
recipient of <i>yagna</i> as well  as  the  supreme  <i>yagna</i>  itself,  there  may  be
possible doubts whether or not He is the  same  or  different  from  it.  To
remedy this  indecision  He  declares  that  He  is  the  indweller  of  all
creatures and He also becomes the material cause or inspiration  to  perform
the <i>yagna</i> as well.
<p>
The Tattva Viveka scripture states: As the indwelling monitor in the  bodies
of all sentient beings the Supreme Lord Krishna is known  as  <i>adhiyagna.</i>  He
alone in His all pervasive omnipresent aspect is celebrated as  the  <i>brahman</i>
and as such is the lord of all <i>yagnas.</i> As  <i>paramatma</i>  He  is  known  as  the
Supreme Soul. The creation of <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings  as  well  as  gross,
physical elements are exclusive activities of the Supreme Lord. Since  <i>jivas</i>
are superior to all creatures they are also known as <i>adhibhuta.</i> The  Supreme
Divinity of all divinities is the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  is  known  as
<i>adhidaivata</i> the lord of all lords, that is why <i>Sri  Laksmi</i>  the  goddess  of
fortune established Herself in His  heart.  So  to  dispel  any  doubts  and
answer the question what is the form of <i>adhiyagna</i> this verse was spoken.
