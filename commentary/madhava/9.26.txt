Perchance one may assume  that  since  Lord  Krishna  is  in  the  paramount
position as the Supreme Lord and God of all lords and gods then His  worship
and propitiation will be the most complicated and difficult and  so  worship
of lesser gods is easier. To clear this misconception  Lord  Krishna  states
<i>me bhaktya prayacchati</i> meaning if one offers to Him with devotion. As it  is
only possible that His devotees have devotion for Him it is natural that  He
only accepts offerings from His devotees. The  Varaha  Purana  states  that:
Offerings from those who are not His devotees by unrighteous means does  not
lead to positive results. Exclusively by <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion  for  His
satisfaction does the Supreme  Lord  become  pleased.  The  Mahabharata  has
stated that: One who is in communion with the Supreme  Lord  through  <i>bhakti</i>
is revered by all. Solely by <i>bhakti</i> to the Supreme Lord exclusively  is  one
considered in this world to be beyond the sway of the three <i>gunas</i> being  the
modes of goodness, passion and ignorance and beyond the pull  of  their  own
self interest for one has communion with the Supreme Lord externally as  the
all pervading cognisant  and  internally  as  <i>paramatma</i>  the  all  pervasive
supreme soul in all sentient beings.
