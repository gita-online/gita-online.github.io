The word brahmano is referring directly to the Supreme Lord Krishna the
recepient of all yagnas or offerings of worship, through His attribute the
Brahman or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence. Such yagnas
according to the qualifiyation of the performer may be mentally performed,
orally performed or physically performed. Knowing this and performing
ordained activities according to the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures
one will attain moksa or liberation from the cycle of birth and death in
the material existence. Performing yagna according to one's rank and
station in life is what is being given here and whether it is mental, oral
or physical the activity is still performed by concerted effort. So what is
ordained by the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures should never be ignored
or disregarded.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
The words vitata brahmano mukhe means everything should be offered to the
Supreme Lord. In the Brahman Vaivartaka Purana it states that: In all
yagnas the Supreme Lord alone is to be propitiated. This means that every
activity and all endeavours one undertakes should be in harmony with the
injunctions and ordinances of the Vedic scriptures which are in complete
and total harmony with the divine will of the Supreme Lord. No other
alternative is tenable or acceptable for a human being.
