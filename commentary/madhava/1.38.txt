If it is asked: O Arjuna, even though  you  refrain  yourself  from  killing
your relatives, it is sure that Bhishma  and  the  Kauravas  will  certainly
kill you without hesitation as they are eager to  engage  in  this  war.  So
what will you do  under  these  circumstances?  To  answer  this  Arjuna  is
speaking this verse beginning <i>yadi mam apratikaram.</i> Being  not  vengeful  is
my atonement for my resolve to slay  them.  <i>Ksemataram</i>  means  much  better,
since the atonement of death will  wash  away  all  sins.  Bhishma  and  the
others fighting on the Kaurava side will not be able be able to  escape  the
result of that sin. This is the internal mood that Arjuna is feeling.
