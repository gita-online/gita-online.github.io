The word <i>ananyas</i> means exclusivity.  It  refers  to  those  who  are  always
focused on the qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord Krishna or any  of
His authorised incarnations and expansions  revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures.
The Gautama Parva states: Renouncing all desires in the mind,  when  nothing
else remains other than remembrance of the pure, primeval Supreme Lord  they
the meditators who possess equanimity in all respects are verily <i>ananya</i>  and
attain Him. In the Moksa Dharma it states: That by Superior desire  for  the
Supreme Lord with all faculties and senses concentrated  in  communion  with
Him time and space is  transcended  and  it  is  possible  to  perceive  the
Supreme Lord within the heart enveloped in a halo of light.
