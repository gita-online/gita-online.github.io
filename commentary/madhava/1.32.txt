<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>

Now the evil consequences of war are described in  detail  with  this  verse
beginning <i>kula-ksaye pranasyanti.</i> The  compound  word  <i>kula-dharmah</i>  meaning
the righteous family traditions prescribed in Vedic rites such as  the  fire
ceremony <i>agnihotra</i> and others of this nature due to the destruction  of  the
dynasty causes a lack of qualified family members  knowledgeable  enough  to
have them performed. When <i>dharma</i> or righteousness  is  absent  then  <i>adharma</i>
unrighteousness appears apprehending the  remaining  dependants  along  with
the whole family destroying the foundations of society.
