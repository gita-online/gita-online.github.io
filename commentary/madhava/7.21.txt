The words <i>yam yam tanum</i> means according to whichever demigod such as  Brahma
the architect of  creation,  Indra  the  celestial  chief,  or  Laxsmi   the
goddess of wealth. The Narada Purana states: There will be cessation to  the
votaries of Brahma and others due to their temporary  nature;  but  for  the
devotees of the Supreme Lord Krishna there  is  no  cessation   due  to  His
eternal nature. What is the goal of <i>moksa</i> or liberation from  the  cycle  of
birth and death? Where does the <i>atma</i> or soul go after attaining  <i>moksa?</i>  All
these considerations are deliberated upon in the chapters of  the  Bhagavad-
Gita dealing with liberation. Even though the  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  of
the Supreme Lord are numerous and His expansions  are  unlimited,  <i>moksa</i>  is
guaranteed and assured to the devotee  who  devoutly  worships  any  one  of
them. This has been revealed in the Brahma Vaivartaka Purana.
