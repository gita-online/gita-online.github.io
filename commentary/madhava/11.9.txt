The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  known  as  <i>Hari</i>  because  He  removes   all
inauspiciousness from His devotees. Also He is known as <i>Hari</i> as  He  is  the
ultimate recipient of all acts of worship and propitiation partaking of  the
libation known as <i>ida</i> as well as the sanctified vegetarian food  offered  by
the householders to the Supreme Lord. And another annotation of  <i>Hari</i>  found
in the Moksa Dharma is that as His complexion is the  most  radiant  of  the
blue colors He is known as <i>Hari</i> as well.
