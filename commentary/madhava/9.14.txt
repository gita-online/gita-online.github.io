To show that there are others who love Him dearly  Lord  Krishna  speaks  of
those beings of  great soul who worship Him with undeviated devotion.

Now begins the summation.

Even though Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord by His own will He has  assumed
a form of a human being  although  possessing  a  purely  spiritual  eternal
body. To consider other lesser gods as equal or  the  same  as  the  Supreme
Lord and not separately distinct and dependent  upon  the  Supreme  Lord  is
offensive. To also consider any  incompleteness  or  impersonal  conceptions
about Him likewise. Any differences between  the  Supreme  Lords  <i>dharma</i>  or
principles of eternal righteousness and His descent into  a  spiritual  body
is also offensive. All such unpropitious mentalities and subsequent  actions
have no value for those who know not the glory of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna
for all they obtain is the  worlds  of  darkness.  Therefore  the  Bhavishya
Purana states that the Supreme Lord should  always  be  considered  as  pure
consciousness in full completeness with the fullness of all attributes.
