Hari OM! The Supreme Lord Krishna elaborately  describes  the  qualities  of
the divine  nature  and  then  describes  the  demoniac  nature  to  clearly
distinguish between the  two.   The  meritorious  qualities  of  the  divine
nature which follows the nature of  Brahma  who  as  the  secondary  creator
manifested all creatures is self  evident.  The  emphasis  is  on  the  word
<i>tapasya</i>  meaning  austerity.  Adherence   to   brahminical   qualities   and
attributes is itself an austerity. <i>Ahimsa</i>  is  non-violence  to  any  being.
Animosity is the intent to cause injury to others, it is the defect  pointed
out in rulers and military commanders.  The  Amarakosa  dictionary  mentions
this as well. Kings and emperors ruling without  fear  by  the  strength  of
their might proudly regard all others  as  inferior.  This  is  said  to  be
arrogance. <i>Tyagah</i> is renunciation of possessiveness such as  obsession  with
position, family, wealth, etc. The  word  <i>ksama</i>  meaning  tolerance  is  the
state of mind which forgives  and  refrains  from  harming  those  who  have
caused harm.
