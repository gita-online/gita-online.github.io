Here the Supreme Lord Krishna is revealing the  predominant  characteristics
of the <i>purusa</i>. The word <i>upadrasta</i> the intimate  witness,  the  monitor.  The
word <i>anumanta</i> means the ordainer, the one  who  impartially  sanctions.  For
the <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  to  be  subjected  to  birth  in  elevated  and
degraded wombs  is  only  due  to  its  attraction  to  associate  with  the
attributes of elevated and degraded actions. But the  independent  cause  is
ultimately the Supreme Lord who as the monitor perceives  all  thoughts  and
actions and sanctions the  <i>jivas</i>  to  exercise  their  minute  independence.
Because the Supreme Lord is within the  heart  of  all  living  beings,  the
overseer of all living entities, the monitor of all actions, He is  referred
to as the witness. Although the <i>jivas</i> are minutely able  to  exercise  their
independence according to their own  volition  and  development  within  the
material existence. It is the Supreme Lord who  empowers  the  consciousness
and energises their minds to accomplish this and so He  is  referred  to  as
the sanctioner. The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  the  omnipotent  ruler  and
controller of all creation. All of His authorised incarnations  as  verified
in Vedic scriptures share these qualities with Him in  various  degrees.  So
the Supreme Lord declaring that He abides within all fields  signifies  that
He abides  within  every  living  being,  within  all  aspects,  within  all
dimensions and within all manifestations of creation. This confirms that  He
and He alone is <i>anumanta</i>.
