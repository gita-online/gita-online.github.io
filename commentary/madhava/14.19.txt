One who perceives the Supreme Lord  as  the  one  from  where  <i>prakriti</i>  the
material substratum pervading physical existence and  the  <i>gunas</i>  the  three
modes of material nature arise from although distinct from  Him.  Know  that
He alone is the performer of all actions. Not only  by  observing  that  the
Supreme Lord, the initiator of all actions is different from the  <i>gunas</i>  but
also  by  seeing  Him  superior  to  everything  such  a  one  attains   the
consciousness of the Supreme Lord. The eternal consort of the  Supreme  Lord
is Laxmi, the goddess of fortune known as Sri.  A  minute  part  of  her  is
<i>prakriti</i> and so also is <i>prakriti's</i> by products of <i>sattva,  rajas</i>  and  <i>tamas</i>
or goodness, passion and ignorance respectively. At the  time  of  universal
creation due to her great  luminousity  Sri  is  known  as  <i>sat</i>  or  eternal
existence and because of her illumination Sri is known as <i>tva.</i> Sri is  known
as <i>Bhu-devi</i> the Earth  because  in  the  process  of  creation  she  is  the
creative enterprice and by this impulse Sri is also called <i>Rajas</i>. Since  she
manifests as the whole Earth Sri is  known  as  Bhumi  and  by.her  deluding
potency which obscures the minds of the <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  she  is
known as Durga or Tamas. The  unliberated  humans  are  thus  controlled  by
these three and the demigods are controlled directly by Sri herself and  she
binds them. Her expansions of Bhu-devi binds the humans  and  her  expansion
of Durga binds the demons to material existence.  Yet  if  any  of  them  by
chance get the opportunity receive the mercy of a Vaisnava devotee  of  Lord
Krishna and understand that He alone is the Supreme Lord of all,  then  they
achieve <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from  material  existence.  The  Visnu  Purana
states:That until the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being realises that Lord  Krishna  is
the Supreme Lord of all they remain like animals in  human  form.  Thus  the
Supreme Lord Krishna should always be remembered and never forgotten.
