The words <i>mad bhavam</i>  denotes  under  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  control
without any duality in perfect spiritual  consciousness  and  full  blissful
existence. The Moksa Dharma explains that for  the  liberated  the  goal  is
conceptualised  as  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum  pervading   all
existence which is the spiritual reality of  the  impersonal  conception  of
the Supreme Lord.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
In exact terms the words <i>mad bhavam</i> means under my  nature.  Only  when  the
nature  of  Lord  Krishna's  transcendental  qualities  and  attributes  and
pastimes are recollected at the time of departing from the physical body  at
the moment of death will one achieve the  cherished  goal  and  attain  Him.
Otherwise if there is no knowledge of His transcendental  nature  there  can
be no remembrance. Naturally one acquires the state  of  consciousness  upon
whatever one meditates upon and this is an absolute essential fact  applying
itself to the destination of one's subsequent  lifetime  at  the  moment  of
death. The remembrance of mundane corporeal things  at  the  time  of  death
assures in the next life a  mundane  corporeal  existence  accordingly.  But
those enlightened and exalted  beings  who  remember  Lord  Krishna  at  the
moment of death attain Him without fail and the means to this are  given  by
the words <i>mam eva smaran</i> meaning remembering  Him  alone  emphases  that  by
constant remembrance spiritual realisation is attained.
<p>
The Sat Tattva states that devotion, knowledge, renunciation  of  activities
prohibited  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  and   performance   of   recommended
activities in the Vedic scriptures,  constant  remembrance  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna or any  of  His  Vedically  authorised  incarnations  and  non-
attachment; all these things combined  grant  transcendental  vision  beyond
the influence of the senses and not any other way.
