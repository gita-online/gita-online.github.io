So it has been established that the  devotees  who  with  full  faith  focus
their minds on the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  offer  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive
loving devotion to Him are the most  superior.  But  what  about  the  other
votaries of the Vedic  culture  who  follow  the  path  of  worshipping  the
imperishable <i>brahman</i> or the spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence
which is unmanifest being imperceptible? What are there rewards?  This  Lord
Krishna elucidates in these two verses.
<p>
In the Bhagavat Purana, the attribute of imperceptibility has been  ascribed
to illusion because it is <i>acintyam</i> or inconceivable and incapable  of  being
rationalized although it is able to be perceived by  some  advanced  beings.
The word <i>aksaram</i> is not referring directly to the Supreme  Lord  but  rather
to His impersonal unmanifest aspect known as  the  imperishable  <i>brahman</i>  or
spiritual substratum pervading all existence. In the  very  beginning  there
was neither existence or non-existence, there was neither superior  elements
or inferior elements. Then there existed only  <i>tamas</i>  or  the  obscurity  of
darkness and within this obscurity alone was the unmanifest,  inconceivable,
ever renewable and was none other  then  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum
pervading  physical  existence  which  is   imperceptible,   possessing   no
distinctive atributes to distinguish her by.
<p>
Similarly it has been stated in the Moksa Dharma: That  being  supported  by
the  attributes  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  Sri  Laxsmi  is  ever  fresh   and
inaccessible to the senses. Beyond the mind,  unborn,  existing  even  after
universal dissolution are  her  special  subsidiary  attributes.   The  Manu
Samhita states that Sri Laxsmi is: Harmful  to  none,  unaffected  by  time,
without enmity to any,  immutable,  without  loss  of  form,  manifested  in
everything, performing every action, she  is  always  existing,  symbolizing
the principles of <i>tamas</i> and inactivity, dormant during  dissolution,  beyond
the scope of logic and reason, unknowable and passive in all activities.
<p>
Later in chapter 15, verse 16 Lord Krishna states:  <i>kutastho  'ksara  ucyate</i>
meaning those who are personal associates of the Supreme  Lord  are  eternal
and infallible like the <i>atma</i> or soul. The Rig Veda  states:  That  which  is
abiding within that space is <i>kutastho</i> of an eternal nature.  So  Sri  Laxsmi
is eternal because she abides there within that space. The  Gautama  section
of the Sama Veda states: The consort of the Supreme Lord is Sri  Laxsmi  and
she is all pervading, immutable, inscrutable, the progenitor and support  of
creation the same as the Supreme Lord  which  is  accomplished  without  any
influence of <i>rajas</i> or passion. According to the Agni Purana  as  Sri  Laxsmi
is never leaving her place at the feet of the Supreme Lord,  she  is  <i>achala</i>
or stationary. The Narada Purana states that: Sri  Laxsmi  and  the  Supreme
Lord are unperceivable, unmanifest and beyond the scope of the mind.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
It has been shown how the Supreme Lord and His <i>sakti</i> or  spiritual  feminine
potency known as Sri Laxsmi are both  unborn  and  eternal.  When  all  else
ceases to exist at the time of universal dissolution the  Supreme  Lord  and
His <i>sakti</i> being unaffected facilitate  the  next  cycle  to  start  creation
anew. The Supreme Lord is called <i>akshara</i> the absolute  and  ultimate  source
of all. His <i>sakti</i> is called <i>kshara</i> who is limited to  the  extent  that  she
remains dormant until the Supreme Lord begins creation.  At  that  time  the
dual nature of the Supreme Lord and His <i>sakti</i> activates the creative  energy
by which such interaction causes the phenomena in the  material  nature  for
unlimited plethora's of species, forms and  names  of  beings  pouring  into
existence. The internal unified form of the Supreme Lord and Sri Laxsmi  are
known as <i>akshara and kshara</i> and their external manifestations  are  know  as
<i>Purusha</i>  the  Supreme  Personality  and  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum
pervading all physical existence.
