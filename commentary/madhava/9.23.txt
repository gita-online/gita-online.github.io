Lord Krishna speaks this verse to alleviate any doubt that He  is  the  sole
recipient  and  ultimate  goal  of  all  Vedic  <i>yagnas</i>   or   offering   and
propitiation as enjoined in the Vedas.

Now begins the summation.

Superior by far to the worshippers of the demigods for  desired  results  as
found in the <i>karma kanda</i> or rituals  for  fruitive  reward  section  of  the
Vedas are the <i>Vaisnavas</i> the exclusive devotees of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna
or any of His authorised  incarnations  or  expansions.  The  <i>Vaisnavas</i>  are
infused with <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotional service for the  Supreme  Lord  and
are without any desires for anything that is not  directly  associated  with
Him. The worship of Brahma or Shiva or the demigods is also worship  of  the
Supreme Lord as it is He who they are worshipping but it is  indirect.  Also
to perform <i>Ashwemdha</i> or other such Vedic rituals for desire  of  rewards  is
also worship of the Supreme Lord as it is He who sanctions such rewards  but
it is not direct as well. The  Agni  Purana  states:  That  the  spiritually
intelligent verily regard the demigods who are the  directors  and  managers
of different aspects of creation as <i>Vaisnavas</i> and that is their  service  to
the Supreme Lord. It should be noted  that  <i>upasana</i>  or  meditation  on  the
attributes of the Supreme Lord as <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme  Soul  within  the
etheric heart  of  all  sentient  beings  as  well  as   meditation  on  His
qualities and <i>lilas</i> or divine pastimes is  in  and  of  itself  the  Supreme
State.
