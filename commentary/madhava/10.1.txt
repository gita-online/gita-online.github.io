Hari OM! This chapter is  narrated  by  Lord  Krishna  for  the  benefit  of
increasing reflection and  meditation  on  the  Supreme  Lord  and  for  the
special incentive of revealing His resplendent glories. Just by  hearing  or
reading these pleasing and delightful verses gives one great satisfaction.
