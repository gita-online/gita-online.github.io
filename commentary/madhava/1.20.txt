So Arjuna is saying to Lord Krishna let me scrutinise those friends of  mine
who have chosen to join the ranks of the Kauravas for  satisfying  the  evil
minded  Duryodhana  instead  of  opposing  him  for  eradicating  his   evil
mindedness which denotes he does not even know how to protect his own  life.
This request is reasonable in order to view my opponents.
