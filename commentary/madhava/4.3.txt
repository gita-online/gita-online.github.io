Hari OM! In this chapter the superiority of the intellect having  its  power
of discrimination, the greatness of the <i>atma</i> or soul possessing its  eternal
nature, the importance of the performance of <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed  Vedic
activities according to position and stage in  life  and  the  supremacy  of
<i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of Vedic wisdom.  Whatever  Lord  Krishna  has
delineated in the previous three chapters should be understood to be  <i>dharma</i>
or absolute principles of eternal righteousness. This is what  is  meant  by
the word <i>iman</i> which means this and refers to the science of  <i>yoga</i>  which  is
the science of the individual consciousness in communion with  the  Ultimate
Consciousness. Lord Krishna wants to impress upon posterity that what He  is
explaining is not temporary relating to time and circumstances but is  <i>nitya</i>
<i>tattva</i> or eternal truths and <i>rita</i> or  inviolable  cosmic  laws.  They  never
become outdated nor do they become irrelevant  with  the  passage  of  time.
They are always relevant, constantly  renewing  themselves,  remaining  ever
fresh as nature is in the universe. Nature as was created in  the  beginning
of time and nature as is present now in the world is not different in  their
essence although there may be difference in the form;  but  form  is  but  a
manifestation it is not  the  essence.  Because  of  the  atrophy  of  human
receptivity and the excess of human depravity along with a decline in  human
intellect there comes about obscurity in human  perception.  Therefore  from
time to time the ashes that are covering the coals need to be  brushed  away
for the embers which  were  hidden  to  glow  in  their  eternal  splendour.
Sometimes the Supreme Lord Himself in  His  <i>avatara</i>  forms  as  scripturally
authorised  incarnations  manifests  and  incarnates  to  periodically   re-
establish these eternal principles of creation. At other times  great  souls
from the higher realms with exceptional compassion descend and  see  a  need
to reiterate and disseminate these divine principles  for  all  of  humanity
suffering in the perpetual cycle of  birth  and  death.  These  great  souls
never modify the intrinsic meaning of these eternal principles nor  do  they
change the essential characteristics of these  eternal  principles  although
they make innovations in  their  preaching  and  how  they  distribute  them
according to time and circumstance. They have nothing new  to  instruct  nor
anything to add they merely come to remove aside the ash  that  has  covered
the glowing embers of eternal principles and to prepare conditions  so  that
beguiled humanity may have the  greatest  opportunity  to  be  receptive  to
these eternal principles.

Hari Om! The wisdom and  performance  of  eternal  spiritual  principles  as
given in the Vedic scripture Pancaratra which Lord Krishna aeons before  had
instructed in initiation to Brahma, Shiva, Indra and Surya  the  sun-god  is
again being explained to the Pandavas  as  the  eternal  principles  of  the
Bhagavad-Gita which is the abridged form of the Pancaratra and  the  essence
of all Vedic scriptures. The  manner  in  which  the  demi-gods,  the  great
sages, the saintly kings and how human beings should  achieve  Vedic  wisdom
by performing <i>karma yoga</i> in <i>Satya, Treta, Dwarpa and kali yugas</i> or the  four
measurements of Vedic duration comprising a period of  1,  360,  000  years.
All these things are explained in the Bhagavad-Gita. From  Arjuna  to  Manu,
all perform <i>karma yoga</i> and gain Vedic wisdom as prescribed in the  Bhagavad-
Gita. The Brahma Vaivarta Purana states that there  is  no  Vedic  scripture
superior to the Bhagavad-Gita. The Pancaratra which is supplementary to  the
four Vedas should be  learned  and  assimilated  in  its  entirety  and  the
Bhagavad-Gita is its essence. Thus there is nothing that can compare to  the
illustrious Bhagavad-Gita.
