<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>
<p>
Duryodhana is thinking that Drona might decline to fight in the battle,  out
of affection for the Pandavas who had been his best disciples. So trying  to
create some anger in Drona towards them, Duryodhana  sneered  and  exclaimed
<i>pasyaitam:</i> Behold these! Implying that the Pandavas are  despicable  because
they are blatantly disrespecting the acarya by  choosing  to  fight  against
their own preceptor.
<p>
Then to incite Drona further Duryodhana says that the military formation  of
the Pandava army has been arrayed by  another  one  of  his  disciples,  the
intelligent son of Drupada. Duryodhana could have called the son of  Drupada
by his name Dhristadyumna; but he purposely used  <i>drupada-putra</i>  because  it
would remind Drona of his  bitter  enemy,  King  Drupada,  who  performed  a
sacrifice specifically to get a son who would be the slayer of  Drona.  This
son was Dhristayumna.
<p>
Duryodhana is calling Dristadyumna intelligent because he  had  learned  the
science of warfare from the very person he  was  born  to  kill.  Futhermore
Duryodhana is implying that it was imprudent of Drona to teach  the  science
of archery to the very person who was destined  to  kill  him  and  who  was
known to be his enemy. Duryodhana's intention in expressing these things  is
that it is because of Drona's indifference to things he was aware of and  in
educating the enemy anyway will be the cause of all the problems  they  will
face in the battle.
