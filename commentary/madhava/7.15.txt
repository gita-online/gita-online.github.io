Why all intelligent beings do not surrender unto the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
is being declared in this verse. It is because they become degraded  due  to
perverted  activities  like  the  most  wretched  of  beings.  Deprived   of
discrimination  their  intelligence  becomes  polluted  and   they   perform
diabolical activities against creation and themselves  and  assume  demoniac
mentalities.  Here the  word  <i>mayayapahrta</i>  means  stolen  by  the  illusory
energy. The Vyasa Yoga states: Awareness is the natural tendency  of  living
entities; by  <i>maya</i>  or  illusory  impressions  superimposed  upon  the  mind
awareness becomes distorted. The word <i>asuram</i> indicating the  demoniac  comes
from the root word <i>a-sura</i> meaning without light. In  the  Narada  Purana  it
states that among the demigods there is a predominance  of  knowledge  which
is light; but among the demoniac <i>asuras</i> there is  a  predominance  of  sense
entanglement which is the absence of light.
