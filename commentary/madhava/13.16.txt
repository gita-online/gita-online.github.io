Here the word <i>Purusa</i> should be understood to refer to the <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied
living entities. In previous verses both the  Supreme  Lord  and  the  <i>jivas</i>
have been referred to as <i>Purusa.</i> Hence this  clarification  is  required  to
understand this verse in the  proper  context.  Thus  the  <i>jiva</i>  enjoys  the
attributes  of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence.  This  statement  by  the  Supreme   Lord   Krishna   effectively
eradicates the arguments of those whose conjecture is that the  relationship
of the physical body and its organs of the  senses  interacting  with  sense
objects  as  instruments  of  action  are  illusory.  The  word  <i>hi</i>  meaning
certainly is used to emphasise that the conjecture of illusion in this  case
is contrary to  actual  experience.  It  has  never  been  observed  by  the
greatest  of  minds  that  internal  experiences  knowledge  and  ignorance,
pleasure and pain are the products of delusion. That these are  illusory  is
unacceptable to both the spiritual mind and the rational  mind.  Only  those
minds which are preoccupied with the external concerns of the physical  body
are susceptible to illusion; but never those who are devoted to <i>atma  tattva</i>
or knowledge  of  the  immortal  soul  and  the  divine  internal  spiritual
experience. It should be pointed out that even external  conceptions  should
only be considered  illusory  when  discrimination  is  accurately  used  in
verification. If it ever were established that  the  internal  consciousness
perfectly perceived by those who are self-realised as eternal  are  illusory
then all that has been collaborated and confirmed by the imperishable  Vedic
scriptures would also have to be considered illusory and that is  impossible
as they are the only authorised and verifiable proof in all of creation  and
anything  whatsoever  contrary  to  the  Vedic  scriptures   is   absolutely
illusory. It must be  understood  that  illusion  is  only  present  in  the
empirical world of material existence. Thus any proof that  could  be  given
must also be empirical and thus determining whether anything is illusory  in
absence of any contrary evidence  must  be  determined  exclusively  by  the
conclusions of the Vedic scriptures.
