Now there is greater curiosity. An enquiry for more details is beseeched  to
understand further who Lord Krishna actually is.  In  normal  existence  one
knows another by their attributes and how one represents themselves but  one
does not know them by their actual inherent nature as it is  not  disclosed.
It is not that Arjuna did not know otherwise he  would  have  not  addressed
Lord Krishna in this verse as <i>Vishnu</i> meaning He who is all pervasive and  in
previous verses as <i>Acutya</i> meaning He who is infallible, <i>Keshava</i>  meaning  He
who controls Brahma and Shiva, <i>Vasudeva</i>  meaning  He  from  whom  everything
emanates, etc. The purpose of the  query  is  know  the  special  attributes
inherent within the Supreme Lord Krishna's divine transcendental nature  and
their qualities and activities.
