That person verily is  distinguished  among  mortals  who  feels  equanimity
towards both those who are righteous and those  who  are  unrighteous.  They
alone understand that the  consciousness residing in every living entity  is
the Ultimate  Consciousness  which  is  the  all  pervasive  medium  equally
present in all beings. The embodied being is literally the manifestation  of
this consciousness and the distinctiveness  is  due  to  the  propensity  of
one's internal potency.  Attributes  such  as  compassion,  magnanimity  and
righteousness are bestowed by the grace of the Supreme Lord as otherwise  it
is not possible to possess them. This has been confirmed by all  the  saints
and sages.

Essentially all embodied beings  are  of  the  form  of  this  consciousness
devoid of any defect. The defects that manifest  among  embodied  beings  is
due to their internal propensity as all  are  emanations  from  the  Supreme
Lord and are dependent  solely  upon  Him.  All  embodied  beings  are  non-
different in their essence and the seeming differences which appear are  due
to distinctive attributes and any seeming perception of  inequality  is  due
to delusion. Thus all human beings are  fundamentally  and  essentially  the
same.  The  Brahma  Purana  states:  That  the  demi-gods  in  the  heavenly
dimensions belong  to  a  special  category  and  have  special  powers  and
attributes that are natural and  eternal  in  order  to  regulate  universal
management throughout  creation.  The  demons  possess  substantial  defects
which appear natural to them and are eternal as well.  Human  being  possess
both attributes and defects which are also natural  and  eternal.  Only  the
Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  His  authorised  incarnations  possess  eternal
attributes always for all time.

It should not be surmised that the righteous ones and the unrighteous  one's
should be respected alike and regarded the same for that would  be  a  grave
error. The Brahma Purana  states:  If  beings  of  equal  qualification  are
worshipped unequally and people of unequal gradation are worshipped  equally
they will be relegated from their position even if they happen to  be  demi-
gods. Manu Samhita states: The wealthy,  family  members,  the  elders,  the
learned and the bonafide spiritual preceptor. All these  are  considered  to
be venerable in  their  places  but  in  gradation  the  subsequent  one  is
superior to the  one  preceding  it.  The  Brahma  Vaivarta  Purana  states:
Whoever respects all living entities with  equal  vision  knowing  that  the
inner  essence  is  the  same  for  all,  pleases  the  Supreme  Lord.   The
distinctions between people due to  the  differences  in  their  methods  of
worship will not be disturbing to one who views all with  equanimity.  Among
the venerable ones who perform worship according to  the  Vedic  scriptures,
if there is at any time mistakes or  defects  in  the  worship  it  will  be
viewed with  equanimity.  The  Garuda  Purana  states:  In  whatever  manner
actions are required to be performed in relation to the  venerable  ones  or
an enemy then those activities are considered as situated in equanimity.

The  Vishnu  Purana  states  that:  One  who  performs  activities   without
expecting anything in return is known as magnanimous. Even while engaged  in
turmoil the one who extends  protection  is  the  friend  and  the  one  who
refuses protection is the enemy. One who neither helps or harms is known  as
passive. One who does not act when things are required to be done  is  known
as irresponsible. One who does hateful things is  known  as  evil.  One  who
performs beneficial activities is known as righteous. Whatever activity  one
is required to perform according to time and  circumstances  and  the  Vedic
scriptures that activity is considered  to  be  in  equanimity.  The  Narada
Purana specifies that: One who is affectionate without  any  expectation  is
the magnanimous one. Seeing suffering  the  one  who  extends  help  is  the
friend.  One  who  causes  pain  is  evil.  One  who  does  not  reciprocate
friendship even when given friendship is ungrateful. One who  does  good  to
others only if good was done for them is known as mediocre. The  magnanimous
one referred to here is the Supreme Lord.
