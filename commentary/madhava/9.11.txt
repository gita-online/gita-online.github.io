Now Lord Krishna explains those who do not know about His  Supreme  position
and why. For those who are deluded their human body appears to be what  they
are and not simply a container for the <i>jiva</i> or the embodied soul.  Therefore
in the Moksa Dharma it is stated: In this world all  the  things  associated
with the body are endowed with the five  gross  elements  of  earth,  water,
fire, air and ether as ordained by the will of the Supreme Lord who  is  the
sole source of all creation. The Supreme Lord Krishna is also  <i>paramatma</i>  or
the Supreme Soul residing within all living entities as the eternal  witness
of everything. He exists with form and He exists without  form.  He  is  the
giver of blessings and boons and He is the master of  the  unmanifest  power
which regulates destruction and creation.

Regarding the Vedic scriptures documenting the  descent  of  Lord  Krishna's
<i>avatars</i> or incarnations in numerous and diverse  manifestations.  It  should
be understood without any doubt that there is absolutely  no  difference  in
essence of any of the Supreme Lord's forms in past, present or  future.  All
Lord Krishna's <i>avatars</i> are <i>sac-cid-ananda</i> or <i>sat</i> of eternal  existence,  <i>cit</i>
or transcendental knowledge  and  <i>ananda</i>  or  unending  bliss  and  are  the
sovereign master of all creation. Whether these <i>avatars</i> are appearing  as  a
fish  such  as  Lord  Matsya,  or  animal  such  as  Lord  Varaha  the  boar
incarnation or half -human like Lord Narasimha the half man  and  half  lion
incarnation or as human incarnations such as  Lord  Rama  and  Lord  Buddha;
they are all different manifestations of the supreme absolute truth and  the
ultimate reality of the Supreme Lord. Therefore there should  never  be  any
misconception or delusion that there is any difference between  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna and any of  His  <i>avatars</i>  which  are  always  verified  by  the
authority of the Vedic scriptures.

Without beginning and without end of purely spiritual form the Supreme  Lord
is the source of Brahma and Shiva and all created beings.  From  His  breath
has  manifested  the  four  Vedas.  The  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual   substratum
pervading all existence  is  His  impersonal  manifestation.  He  is  <i>Isvara</i>
<i>Parama</i> the Supreme controller of all creation. The word <i>bhuta-mahesvaram</i>  in
this verse means the Supreme Lord of all  beings  and  this  has  also  been
stated in the Babhravya section of the Sama Veda.
