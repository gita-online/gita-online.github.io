That it is impossible to renounce every single action one  makes  is  what's
being clarified here
<p>

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Actions are spoken of as two-fold in the Paingi scripture. Actions that  are
dependent upon a cause and and actions which  are independent of any  cause.
The actions that are dependent upon a cause are  due  to  the  influence  of
<i>prakriti,</i> material nature. Independent actions  are  only  manifesting  from
the Supreme Lord. Therefore the words <i>karyate he  avasah</i>  means  to  perform
activities fully dependent, this dependence is on the Supreme Lord  Krishna.
The scriptures  also  further  clarify  that  <i>ah</i>  means  the  all  pervasive
Brahman.
