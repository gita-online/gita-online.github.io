This empirical statement <i>tat prasadat</i> means  by  His  Grace.  It  should  be
understood that Lord Krishna is referring to His Grace as  that  of  any  of
His  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and  expansions  as  authorised   in   Vedic
scriptures. They all as a part  of  Lord  Krishna  abide  as  <i>paramatma</i>  the
supreme soul within the heart of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings. Any  part  of
the whole is imbued with the whole. So Lord Krishna's three aspects  of  the
<i>brahman</i> the spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence,  <i>paramatma</i>  and
<i>bhagavan</i> which is His  original  eternal  two  armed  spiritual  form  which
includes all of His <i>avatars</i> in many different forms. So  this  verse  should
be understood empirically as well. Clarifying this point further an  example
is given from Mahabharata that states: <i>Dronam prati  Bhima  vacanavat</i>  which
means: Bhima said that Drona was a father to Him. Bhima's actual father  was
King Pandu but he spoke empirically to  illustrate  that  the  affection  he
received from Drona was like from a father. This is the gist of it.
