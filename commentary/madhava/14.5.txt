The forms and accruements of attachment obstructing  the  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied
being in relation to <i>atma tattva</i> or realization  of  the  immortal  soul  is
indicated in this verse. The words  <i>sattva,  rajas</i>  and  <i>tamas</i>  are  usually
depicted  as  goodness,  passion  and  nescience.  But   there   are   other
interpretations  of  the  same.  <i>Sattva</i>   is   luminous   because   goodness
illuminates. <i>Rajas</i> is exuberance giving passion to the ego and  momentum  to
activity. <i>Tamas</i> is nescience the degenerative utilization of <i>rajas</i>  and  the
total antithesis of <i>sattva.</i>
