Due to this supra-conscious awareness illuminating one's  intelligence  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the soul is attained and  once  this  happens  then
one realises the soul, as a  manifestation  of  the  Supreme  Lord  existing
equally in all living beings. This is purport  Lord  Krishna  is  giving  in
this verse.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Even though there are external  differences  in  the  forms  among  embodied
beings including humans, aquatics, animals  and  plants,  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna is ever present in each and every  being  as  a  witness  energising
them all as the Supreme Soul and from whom  a  minuscule  portion  comprises
the eternal individual soul.
