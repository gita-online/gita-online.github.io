Lord Krishna  speaks  of  the  different  grades  and  types  of  <i>yagnas</i>  or
offerings and worship and the goals desired. Although the  word  <i>daivam</i>  may
refer to the demigods; it can also  refer  exclusively  to  the  resplendent
Supreme Lord who verily  is  the  ultimate  goal  of  all  <i>yagnas  by  those</i>
<i>exclusively devoted to Him. Thus the propitiation of  the  Supreme  Lord  is</i>
<i>the distinctive  superior  attribute  of  performance  of  action.  For  the</i>
<i>spiritually intelligent situated in atma tattva</i> there exists  nothing  else.
Every action even every breath is a <i>yagna</i> dedicated  to  the  Supreme  Lord.
<i>Yagna</i> is verily the Supreme Lord  so  by  this  <i>yagna</i>  is  performed  within
<i>yagna.</i> In this way it can be understood that everything offered in <i>yagna</i>  is
of the <i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
One who perceives the <i>Brahman</i>  pervading  everywhere  there  exists  nothing
else for them except the personal communion  with  the  resplendent  Supreme
Lord, who to reciprocate with His devotee becomes the very  <i>yagna</i>  which  is
being performed. In the fire of the <i>yagna,</i> in  the  offerings  of  <i>havih</i>  or
ghee and grainseeds, in the paraphernalia being used to perform  the  <i>yagna.</i>
In the form of <i>yagna</i> the goal of <i>yagna</i> being  the  Supreme  Lord  is  verily
being offered to Himself. Thus everything becomes the <i>Brahman.</i>  Through  His
propitiation performed according to Vedic injunctions all the  sense  organs
like eyes and tongue are brought under control  and  all  the  sense  become
neutralised and passive. In the Brihadaranya Upanisad I.IV.X  it  is  stated
that the <i>Brahman</i> alone was in the  beginning  and  it  knew  itself  as  the
<i>Brahman</i> and then the <i>Brahman</i> manifested into the all. Whosoever amongst  the
demigods becomes awakened to this consciousness indeed  becomes  similar  to
this consciousness. It is the same for elevated  beings  and  the  same  for
sages and yogis and it is the same for humans.
