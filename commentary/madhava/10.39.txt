Lord Krishna speaks in general about His <i>vibhuti</i> or  divine,  transcendental
opulence. They all are verily manifestations of His spiritual form  and  are
endowed with an infinitesimal measure of His power  and  splendour.  In  the
Paingi scripture the same has been  stated:  In  particular  Brahma,  Shiva,
Garuda,  Emperors  of  the  whole  Earth  examples  such  as   Bharata   and
Yudhisthira and great devotees of the  Supreme  Lord  such  as  Hanuman  and
Arjuna are minute fractions of the Supreme Lords  <i>vibhuti.</i>  Narayana,  Rama,
Vishnu, Narasingha, etc. are <i>avatars</i> or direct incarnations  and  expansions
of the Supreme Lord Krishna Himself. In the Gautama section it is  mentioned
that Krishna is the Supreme Lord in  the  maximum  fullness  and  His  other
<i>avatars</i>  are  expansions  of  Him.  The  seers,  sages,   the   munis,   the
enlightened, the self-realised, the powerful sons of Manu are all  fragments
of Lord Krishna's <i>vibhuti.</i> Others are incarnations of Lord Krishna  Humself.
The Bhagavat Purana has declared that sages and seers  such  as  Bhrigu  and
Brihaspati are fragments and others such as Vamana and  Varaha,  and  Buddha
and the like are His <i>avatars</i> with the same power,  majesty  and  potency  as
Him. His <i>avatars</i> are transcendental and eternal exactly like Him in  potency
although of different forms. Lord Krishna speaks the  words  <i>mama  tejo'msa-</i>
<i>sambhavan</i> which means are born from  a  fraction  of  His  power  should  be
understood to be endowed with a fraction of His splendour and not born  from
it. Endowment due to  association  with  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  creates  a  permanent
effect which manifests as a fraction of His <i>vibhuti.</i>
