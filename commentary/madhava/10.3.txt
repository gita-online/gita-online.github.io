The word <i>anadim</i> meaning without beginning contains  two  root  words  within
it. <i>Ana</i> which means that which energises  everything  and  <i>adi</i>  which  means
that which is the origin  of  everything.  Therefore  Lord  Krishna  is  the
energising cause of all without beginning. Thus the word <i>ajam</i>  being  unborn
and <i>anadim</i> have both been established.

Now begins the summation.

<i>Ana</i> can also denote the original primal breath. Thus  the  Supreme  Lord  is
even prior to it. It may appear  to  one  not  use  to  discriminating  that
<i>anadim</i> and <i>ajam</i> have similar meanings but that  would  be  a  misconception.
While <i>ajam</i> means unborn, <i>anadim</i> denotes He existed before the  manifestation
of the primal breath of creation. At that time nothing else  existed  except
the resonant sound of OM which  was  vibrating  within  the  Supreme  Lord's
transcendental heart. When the eternal, transcendental  sound  vibration  OM
manifested impulse in the primal breath that  impulse  manifested  into  the
<i>brahman</i> the spiritual substratum pervading all existence and then  into  the
phenomena of myriad effusions of  variegated  creations  and  diverse  forms
corresponding to the  various  and  diverse  parts  of  the  anthropomorphic
spiritual form of the Supreme Lord.
