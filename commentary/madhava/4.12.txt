Those  that  are  worshipping  the  demi-gods  and   other   religions   and
denominations, how can they be understood to  be  following  Lord  Krishna's
path? The proof is given in the second  half  of  this  verse  being:  quick
indeed do  they  get  their  desired  fruits  from  such  worship.  This  is
confirmed in the Chandogya Upanisad  where  it  states:  <i>tasya  ime  venayam</i>
<i>gayanti, tasmat te dhanasanayah</i> which clarifies that from the  Supreme  Lord
alone are bequeathed the rewards of one's actions.
