What <i>Kaunteya</i> who is Arjuna the son of Kunti had started speaking  is  being
expressed by the words beginning with <i>drstveman.</i> Although the word  <i>svajanam</i>
is in the singular tense it  actually  refers  to  the  members  of  Arjunas
dynasty. As per the <i>Amarkosa</i> the Sanskrit lexicon the  word  <i>svajanam</i>  means
relative, friend, comrade, kinsmen by marriage, etc. Thus Arjuna  by  seeing
them all, his hands, legs and other bodily limbs became numb and by the  use
of the word <i>parisusyati</i> which means drying up. It is said  that  the  drying
up of the mouth is much more excruciating than exertions of hard labour.
