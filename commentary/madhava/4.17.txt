<i>Moksa</i> or liberation from the material existence  will  not  be  achieved  by
mere knowing  of the do's and don'ts of action. Only  by  correct  knowledge
of the nature of  actions  can  one  achieve  <i>moksa.</i>  Factually  this  means
without knowledge of the resplendent Supreme Lord and how  all  actions  are
ultimately performed in relation to Him, it will be impossible  to  ever  be
delivered  from  <i>samsara</i>  or  the  repetitive  cycle  of  birth  and  death.
Realisation of the Supreme Lord Krishna as <i>paramatma</i>  or  the  Supreme  Soul
within the  etheric  heart  of  every  living  being  is  the  indispensable
ingredient for <i>moksa,</i> how can there be  success  any  other  way.  <i>Karma</i>  is
performing actions, <i>akarma</i> is the non-performance of actions and <i>vikarma</i>  is
performing improper actions,  which  are  prohibited.  Actions  filled  with
desire and craving  are <i>vikarma</i> and prohibited.  Why  are  they  prohibited?
Because they create bondage for the living  entity  to  material  existence.
Therefore the wise after reflecting and contemplating  the  intricacies  of
action in this light should  perform  actions  accordingly.  Such  sagacious
persons do not become deluded and deviate from this  course  during  adverse
situations even though it is deluding and bewildering for others.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Actions also have originated from Lord Krishna so for this reason  as  well,
one desirous of their best welfare should by all means become  knowledgeable
of Him. Since everything has  ultimately  emanated  from  the  Will  of  the
Supreme  Lord,  including  even  the  energy  behind  every  action  it   is
superfluous not to accept Him completely but at  least  every  being  should
understand His supreme position. Only by knowledge of Him can one tread  the
path that leads to <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the material existence.
