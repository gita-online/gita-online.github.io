In this verse Lord Krishna tells  the  signs  of  one  who  has  established
themselves in equanimity of mind.  For  such  a  person  there  is  absolute
detachment because there is no desire for results. If one is devoted to  the
Supreme Lord then all imperfections dissolved on their own. If  one  is  not
devoted then they are eradicated by special effort.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
How does one become detached from one's actions? The answer is  to  renounce
the desire for the rewards of actions or if one is devoted  to  the  Supreme
Lord to offer all the rewards to Him. By acting in either of these ways  one
is considered performing renunciation for the Supreme Lord.
