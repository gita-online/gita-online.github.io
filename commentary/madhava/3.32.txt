In these verses Lord Krishna is speaking about the merits one receives  from
following the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita. Those who  perform  prescribed
Vedic activities with renunciation gradually achieve <i>moksa</i> or liberation  by
<i>jnana yoga</i> the path of cultivating Vedic knowledge. Who then  can  calculate
the position of one who has attained <i>atma-tattva</i> or  soul  realisation.  Now
<i>karma yoga</i> the path of performing prescribed Vedic actions is not  given  as
another medium of attainment. Renunciation and dedication of  one's  actions
are  solely  for  the  sake  of  realising  the  Supreme  Being  only.   For
realisation of the Supreme  Being,  liberation  does  not  depend  upon  one
particular path. In the Narayana Shataksara it is  stated  that:  All  paths
may or may not award <i>moksa</i> to the  dedicated  aspirant  treading  upon  them
depending upon their level of renunciation in the performance of  unattached
actions.  But renunciation by itself,  not  being  dependent  upon  anything
else is capable of awarding <i>moksa</i> to those who fully perform  it<i>.</i>  Therefore
the contention that <i>jnana yoga</i> and <i>karma yoga</i> alone are sufficient to  award
<i>moksa</i> is not correct.
