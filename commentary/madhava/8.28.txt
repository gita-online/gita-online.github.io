The one who has understood and assimilated the truth regarding  the  purport
to Lord Krishna's unequivocal answers to Arjuna's eight  questions  as  well
as the process of  attaining it will never forget the Supreme  Lord  whether
performing activities or not performing activities. Therefore it  is  stated
in the Skanda Purana: Knowing the two paths which lead to the archi-adi  the
path  of  light,  along  with  the  process,   the   methodology   and   the
implementation one will not be deluded  in  the  knowledge  of  the  supreme
attainment.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
One who following these two paths by knowledge of the pre-eminent  paramount
position  of  the  Supreme  Lord  realises  the  brahman  or  the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence  which  is  more  meritorious  than  even
study of the Vedas, attains  the  eternal  abode  of  the  Supreme  Lord  in
association with Him.
