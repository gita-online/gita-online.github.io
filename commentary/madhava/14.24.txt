In this verse  the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substrtatum pervading all  existence
refers to Sri Laxsmi,  the  goddess  of  fortune.  This  is  what  is  being
clarified by the words <i>brahmano hi.</i> As one attains Sri  Laxsmi  one  attains
the Supreme Lord as she is never separated from Him. So  by  her  grace  one
attains the immortal, eternal, imperishable state of the Lord  Krishna.  The
word  <i>aikantikanye</i>  means  the  ultimate  and  denotes  the  happiness   one
experiences  in  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord.  Thus  the  manner  of
attaining Him has been explained.
