Only one situated in the state of <i>atma-tattva</i> or  soul  realisation  is  not
required to perform activities prescribed in the Vedic scriptures.  So  Lord
Krishna is indicating to Arjuna that since he is  not  established  in  this
state he should perform actions as a matter of duty.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
For all those who have not achieved <i>atma-tattva</i>  and  are  not  situated  in
<i>moksa</i> or liberation, the performance of  prescribed  actions  of  the  Vedic
scriptures is mandatory according to qualification. Therefore the  need  for
desireless, unattached actions is necessary.  For  those  who  are  attached
performance of actions exclusively to please the Supreme Lord are the  best.
Arjuna had not attained <i>moksa</i> at that time; but  he  and  his  brothers  the
Pandava's were certainly well endowed in wisdom being knowledgeable  of  the
path to <i>atma-tattva</i> and were dedicated to  pleasing  the  Supreme  Lord  and
following all the injunctions and prohibitions of the Vedic scriptures.  The
differences  in  consciousness  between  the  righteous   Pandavas  and  the
liberated ones was not that big; but the Pandavas still  needed  to  perform
actions while the liberated ones had no actions to perform.
