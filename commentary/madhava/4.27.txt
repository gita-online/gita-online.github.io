The compound words atma-samyama-yogagnau means with the intelligence
controlled by the soul by the fire of yoga or the individual consciousness
in communion with the ultimate consciousness. This infers that due to
spiritual wisdom and knowledge an intensity of self-restraint and
determination is activated. It must be emphasised here that mere mechanical
control of the senses will not bring the desired result. When the mind has
achieved full knowledge and wisdom it perceives that it is no longer needs
to control the senses because by discrimination the senses are naturally
restrained and one becomes qualified to gain communion with the ultimate
consciousness.
