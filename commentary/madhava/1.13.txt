Bhishma blowing his conch shell at this moment showed to Duryodhana that  he
had factually assumed his position as commander and  chief  of  the  Kaurava
army and immediately after his thunderous blast  all  the  soldiers  of  the
Kauravas followed suit making many sounds and  other  noises  in  readiness.
<i>Panava</i> means  drums, <i>anaka</i> means  kettledrums  and  <i>go-mukha</i>  means  blowing
horns. These are all musical  instruments  and  all  these  sounds  combined
together from the soldiers caused a great uproar.
