Enveloping everything or containing all, abiding in all and the goal of  all
Lord Krishna is known as <i>Vasu,</i> Being the God of all  gods  He  is  known  as
<i>deva.</i> Thus He is <i>Vasudeva</i> and a  <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental  opulence
of Lord Krishna. The Moksa Dharma scripture states: Enveloping all  creation
He illuminates  it just like the rays of the sun as the  indwelling  monitor
within all living  entities,  He  is  therefore  known  as  <i>Vasudeva.</i>  Being
especially in all things as the best of them,  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  is  <i>Vyasa.</i>  The
Agniveshya section states: He is <i>Vyasa. Vy</i> means the best. He is  above,  He
is below, He is in the east, He is in the west, He is in the  north  and  He
is in the south. Whatever we see or hear  in  any  direction  externally  or
internally in all dimensions is already established by the Supreme Lord.
