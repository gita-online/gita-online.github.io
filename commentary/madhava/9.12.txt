The results of delusion are explained here  by  Lord  Krishna.  Vain  hopes,
ineffectual desires and unobtainable dreams. These are the rewards  for  all
those who disrespect and disregard the Supreme Lord. There is no success  in
their efforts. The actions which they undertake are useless to them as  even
whatever  knowledge they possess is worthless and  of  no  avail.  Even  the
efforts they make to insure a pleasant destination in the next life have  no
value and will not bear any results because such  miscreants  and  offenders
who disrespect and disregard the Supreme Lord Krishna are  hurled  from  the
platform of humanity into the lower species of  life  such  as  reptile  and
insect to revolve in <i>samsara</i> or the endless cycle of birth  and  death.  The
Moksa Dharma specifically states that anyone  who  derides,  disrespects  or
detests the Supreme Lord Krishna by thought, by speech  or  by  actions  are
sentenced to eternal perdition in hell along with all their  ancestors.  How
can such unfortunates who  are  inimical  to  the  very  Supreme  Being  who
resides within them as <i>paramatma</i> or the Supreme Soul in all  created  beings
not deserve such a censure along with all  their  corrupted  line.   In  the
Shandilya section of the Sama Veda it is even stated that those  who  detest
and disrespect the excellent devotees of the  Supreme  Lord  who  mercifully
distribute knowledge  of  His  glories  to  all  the  conditioned  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied souls, such offenders are not only the lowest of all  but  are  not
even equal to the despicable beings who perform abortions being  killers  of
embryos.

In the Vedic  scriptures  are  mentioned  the  stories  of  kings  who  were
liberated even by hatred of the Supreme Lord. How is this to be  understood?
Such  kings  as  Sishupala,  Paundra,  Salva  and  others  while  harbouring
animosity  against  the  Supreme  Lord  still  received  <i>sayuja   moksa</i>   or
liberation by nearness to Him and thus able  to  assimilate  His  look,  His
gait, His smile, His style etc. So if liberation is awarded  even  to  those
who were inimical to Him then needless to say that  those  who  are  totally
devoted to Him will surely attain <i>moksa</i> as well. All these pastimes are  for
the purpose of eulogising the Supreme Lord's compassion for  those  devotees
that have continuous remembrance of Him. For His devotees in  any  life  who
due to the powerful influence of being cursed can only  constantly  remember
Him in a mood of antagonism, Lord Krishna  still  bequeaths  upon  them  the
reward of  their  devotion.  Thus  devotees  from  previous  lives  such  as
Sishupala who were so cursed in this manner that  they  were  unable  to  be
affectionate to the Supreme Lord. They were full of so  much  animosity  and
antagonism due to the influence of curses. The same holds true for Jaya  and
Vijaya who later became Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyagarbha as  well  as  Ravana
and  Kumbakarna.   Therefore  by  mentioning  various  incidents  those  who
detested the Supreme Lord and were awarded  <i>moksa</i>  is  explained.  Otherwise
why would there be any reference to such  non-consequential  events.  It  is
only to remind the doubters that the Supreme Lord is  equally  compassionate
to those who disparage and deride Him after taking into consideration  their
past life services of devotion. Lord Krishna confirms this Himself in  verse
31 of this chapter where He proclaims <i>kaunteya  pratijanahi  na  me  bhaktah</i>
<i>pranasyati</i> which translates: Declare it boldly O Arjuna that My  devotee  is
never vanquished.
<p>
Still there may be some doubt that remembrance in any manner could  be  seen
as a contradiction. It is quite natural that those who cherish  hatred  will
always hate, in which case it could be erroneously surmised that  by  hating
one's teacher one will also gain the greatness of the teacher. But there  is
no such contradiction in the Supreme Lord by accepting both  the  worshipper
and the detractor giving identical rewards  to  their  actions  due  to  His
being instantly omniscient and able to perceive their past life  service  to
Him. Great devotees in past lives like Hiranakasipu who became  inimical  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna's incarnation of Narasimhadeva and  was  slain  and
liberated by Him and released from the effects  of  the  curse  due  to  his
son's great devotion and his praying for the Supreme Lord's grace to  redeem
his father. Yet these are special instances that correspond to  the  Supreme
Lord performing some specific <i>lila</i>  or  divine  pastime  and  they  are  the
exception and not the rule. Animosity to the  Supreme  Lord  and  antagonism
against Him is absolutely not the means or achieving <i>moksa</i> by any means  and
it should not be construed as such. The Supreme Lord  is  of  course  always
free to liberate whomsoever He desires but because  those  who  hate  cannot
reciprocate love and affection towards Him they can never be situated  in  a
state of normal devotion and hence are unable to experience Him in a  loving
devotee relationship. It has already been stated by  Lord  Krishna  that  he
considers those who hate the Supreme Lord as <i>asuric</i> not divine and  <i>raksasas</i>
or demoniac and very evil minded. Therefore it is established and should  be
understood that it is never possible for the demoniac and  satanic  to  ever
attain <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the material existence.
