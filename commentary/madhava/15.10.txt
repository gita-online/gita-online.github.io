Those who assiduously strive will perceive the <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul  after
achieving spiritual intelligence. It is not enough to become  complacent  or
be  satisfied  after  acquiring  equanimity  of  mind  from  meditation  and
reflection. One must continuously strive with great faith in  the  teachings
of the spiritual preceptor until the goal  is  finally  attained.  Otherwise
there is always a possibility of  contamination  of  the  mind  due  to  the
influences of the  <i>gunas</i>  or  three  modes  of  material  nature.  The  word
<i>akritatmano</i> means those of impure mind and as such they will  be  unable  to
perceive the <i>atma</i> although possessing  sufficient  intelligence.  A  classic
example of this is Ravana.
