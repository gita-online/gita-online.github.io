The seven  great  sages  of  an  earlier  age  are  Marici,  Atri,  Angiras,
Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasisitha of magnificent splendour. It is  found
in the Moksa Dharma abd throughout the Puranas. Among the  Manus  the  first
was Svayambhu and the  others  were  Sarochisa,  Raivata  and  Uttama  of  a
previous age and from them came all humans and not  from  Bhrgu  and  others
who came after and are from our present age. The words  <i>imah  prajah</i>  spoken
by Lord Krishna denotes the descending lineage  of  the  four  orders  being
<i>brahmins, ksatriyas, vaisyas</i> and <i>sudras</i> and does not  refer  to  any  beings
born in the future. So these four Manus headed by Svayambhu are the  primary
ones and the otherss coming after are subsequent ones. Even in  the  Gautama
text  it  has  been  mentioned:  Those  who  are  connected  to   Svayambhu,
Svarochita, Raivata and Uttama have very good progeny.
<p>
Even though Tapasama is senior to Svarochita,  his  name  is  not  mentioned
here because he is one of the descendants of the  Supreme  Lord  and  so  it
would be incongruous with the words <i>manasa jata</i> referring  to  the  mentally
expanded forms from Brahma. This is recorded in the  Bhagavat  Purana  where
descriptions of the Manus have been  enumerated,  that  Brahma  created  the
Manus from his mind and it also states that without relinquishing  the  body
given to them by Brahma it was possible for them to be born as  Priyavrata's
sons. Both interpretations are capable to be accepted.  This  is  proven  by
Lord Krishna using the word <i>purve</i> meaning their  predecessors.  The  use  of
the word <i>mad-bhava</i> meaning from His energy confirms that  even  though  they
were created from the mind of Brahma, they are integrally endowed with  Lord
Krishna's potency.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The Brahma Purana states  that  Marici,  Atri,  Angiras,  Pulastya,  Pulaha,
Kratu and Vashistha of great splendour  were  earlier  known  as  the  seven
sages Because of exceptional intelligence Brahma  and  other  demigods  were
sometimes known as Manus. Even though the demigods were numerous  they  were
sometimes referred to as  Manus  because  of  the   divisions  of  the  four
orders. Because of weakness some of the demigods were known as <i>dina</i> or  weak
while other demigods such as Brahma and Rudra  were  known  as  strong.  The
demigods for whose favour worship was done not to  propitiate  Lord  Krishna
but instead to acquire some  material  benefits  were  known  as  <i>dina.</i>  The
worship and propitiation directed towards Lord Krishna  was  performed  only
by those demigods who were known as Manu  and  they  did  not  direct  their
worship to any other source than Him. The Maha  Vishnu  Purana  states:  The
progeny of Marici and others were known as <i>manavas</i> or  human  beings.  Their
sons and grandsons and great  grandsons  gradually  populated  part  of  the
material  creation of the Supreme Lord Krishna.
