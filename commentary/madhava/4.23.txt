Now Lord Krishna summarises the conclusion of the previous five verses.  The
compound words <i>gata- sangasya</i> means being freed from  desires  for  rewards.
The  word  <i>muktasya</i>  means  being  free  from  bodily  vanity.   The   words
<i>jnanavasthita.cetasah</i>  means  one  who  has  communion  with  the   ultimate
consciousness residing in the heart.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Being free from all dependence means to take complete refuge in the  Supreme
Lord and to be totally under His protection.  Liberated  means  to  be  free
from all sense of pride.
