The word <i>prabhavam</i> means supremely sublime divine  appearance  denoting  the
splendorous glory of Lord Krishna as the source  of  all  creation  and  the
origin of all beings. Therefore all principles spoken herein are  the  self-
evident premises. If the demigods and all other  gods  existed  previous  to
the Supreme Lord then they would have been aware  of  His  manifestation  or
would have perceived Him through their comprehensive awareness. Hence it  is
self-evident that they were not existing  previously.  Lord  Krishna  states
the words <i>aham adih</i> meaning He is the root origin of  all.  So  it  is  self
evident. How could other gods know of Him before when  the  entire  material
manifestation is subservient  to  Him?  So  it  is  only  for  the  sake  of
remembrance that He again mentions that He is the origin of all.  The  Vedic
scriptures state: Who verily knows the Supreme Lord and can state whence  He
became and where creation came from. The demigods and all  other  gods  came
subsequently after creation. So who can  declare  when  creation  came  into
existence.The Rig Veda X.CXXIX.VI declares: When His splendour is  not  even
fathomable by the gods then how can mere mortals of limited  knowledge  know
Him.

Now begins the summation.

The word <i>sura-ganah</i> is used to make reference to  all  other  gods  who  are
minor and lesser.
