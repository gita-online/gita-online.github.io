Through the medium of <i>prakriti,</i> the spiritual substratum pervading  physical
existence, by the <i>gunas</i> or three modes  of  material  nature,  the  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being experiences the instruments of the  senses  in  pursuance  of
enjoyment. Like  when  one  plays  upon  the  stringed  <i>vina</i>  it  is  played
factually for the Supreme Lords pleasure alone. But the Supreme Lord  enjoys
only those attributes and qualities  which  are  auspicious  and  righteous.
What is inauspicious and unrighteous is only enjoyable  by  the  demons  and
those who are evil.  Such  inauspiciousness  and  unrighteousness  is  never
pleasing to Lord Krishna. This can be understood by the  following  analogy.
Darkness is existing but the moment the sun appears darkness  disappears  so
the sun has no opportunity to experience  darkness.  In  the  same  way  the
Supreme Lord never has an occasion to experience what is not auspicious  and
righteous.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  enjoys  through  the  senses  the   auspicious,
propitious  activities  ordained   in   Vedic   scriptures.   Although   the
resplendent Supreme Lord is completely blissful and satified  in  every  way
He experinces these things like participating in a sporting manner.
