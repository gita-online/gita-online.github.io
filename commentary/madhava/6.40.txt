Lord Krishna states the words aneka-janma meaning after many births the
aspirant by spiritual experience acquires spiritual knowledge and
accumulated merit after many lifetimes and achieves moksa or liberation
from the material existence. If one exerts themselves sincerely and
intensely one becomes endowed with devotion to the Supreme Lord. In the
Narada Purana it states: Knowing, perceiving and meditating for many lives
in the mood of devotion a person invariably attains the immaculate Supreme
Lord and not by any other manner or means.
