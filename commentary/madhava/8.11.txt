The ultimate goal to be attained  is  explained  by  Lord  Krishna  in  this
verse. Since the aspirants attain that consciousness it is  known  as  <i>padam</i>
or state and once that state  is  reached  it  is  designated  by  the  word
<i>visanti</i> meaning to enter. The Narada Purana states: That the  ultimate  goal
to be attained is Lord Krishna is confirmed in the Vedic  scriptures.  Since
that consciousness is achieved by the ascetics, it is known as <i>padam.</i>
