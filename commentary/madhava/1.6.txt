The attribute <i>vikrantah</i> meaning valiant is given  to  Yudhamanyu  and  again
the attribute <i>viryavan</i> which is heroic is given to Uttamauja. <i>Saubhadrah</i>  is
Abhimanyu the son of Subhadra who is the wife  of  Arjuna.  <i>Draupadeyah</i>  are
the five sons of  Draupadi  who  are:  Pratibindha,  Srutasena,  Srntakirti,
Satanika and Srutavarma and by the use of the word <i>ca</i> it refers  to  Bhima's
son Ghatatkaca and others.
<p>
As for the Pandavas themselves Duryodhana did not mention  them  at  all  as
their name and fame was known by everybody. The names  of  these  17  heroes
mentioned and all those in favor of the Pandavas  are  all  <i>maha-rathas.</i>  By
the use of the word <i>sarve</i> meaning all, Duryodhana  instigates  and  agitates
the fighting mood of Drona, by adding even those warriors who are  <i>atirathas</i>
and placed them in the class of <i>maha-rathas</i> as well.
<p>
The defintion of <i>maha-ratha</i> is he who can fight against  10,000  bowmen  all
at the same time and not be defeated and is  a  master  in  the  science  of
warfare and the use of all weapons. An <i>ati-ratha</i> is a  hero  who  can  fight
against innumerable bowmen but less than 10,000 at the same time and  remain
undefeated. A <i>yoddha-ratha</i> is the hero who can fight against one  bowmen  at
a time and remain undefeated and one  who  cannot  even  fight  against  one
bowman successfully is called an <i>arddha-ratha.</i>
