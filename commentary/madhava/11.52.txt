The conclusion of all Vedic scriptures and goal of all  Vedic  teachings  is
now being revealed by Lord Krishna. The  words  <i>mad-bhaktah</i>  mean  exclusive
loving devotion. The study of  the  Vedas,  performing  rituals,  giving  in
charity, practicing austerities etc as given in verse 48  was  in  reference
to seeing the thousand armed <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal  form.  The  same
instructions were given in verse 53 in reference to  seeing  Lord  Krishna's
transcendental <i>saccidananda</i> form of eternal existence, unlimited  cognisance
and endless bliss. Here Lord Krishna specifies that by <i>bhakti</i> in  dedicating
all one's actions to  Him,  performing  devotion  to  Him,  making  Him  the
ultimate goal of one's life without emnity towards any living entity is  the
method by which one can ultimately  attain  Him  and  all  other  activities
Vedic activities must be accompanied by exclusive loving devotion unto Him.
