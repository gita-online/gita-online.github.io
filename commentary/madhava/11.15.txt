The word <i>aneka</i> means infinitely innumerable. In Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i>  or
divine universal form were seen  multitudinous  arms,  faces,  stomachs  and
eyes unlimitedly. The Supreme Lord has unlimited vision in past present  and
future. He is unlimited in every aspect conceivable. manifestations in  many
wonderful and phenomenal forms. The Rig Veda states that with His  shoulders
the Supreme Lord creates all gross material  worlds  and  the  three  spaces
between them. The Yajur Veda confirms this also.

The word <i>visva</i> denotes without any restrictions whatsoever being  unlimited.
Everything, everywhere regarding Lord  Krishna  is  infinitely  endless  and
complete in all  manifestations  and  so  are  the  unlimited  arms,  faces,
stomachs and eyes of the Supreme Lord's <i>visvarupa.</i> The compound word <i>ananta-</i>
<i>rupam</i> means innumerable are His forms and it also means that His  forms  are
unlimited. The Yajur Veda states: The Supreme Lord Krishna  is  superior  to
the most supreme, greater  then  the  total  creation,  the  one  without  a
second, the One who manifests all manifested forms unlimitedly.  The  Aditya
Purana states that the Supreme Lords unlimited forms in  material  existence
is manifested by <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum pervading all  physical
existence. <i>Prakriti</i> being the representative of the Supreme Lord's  material
energy is thus without beginning, middle or end in all its activities.

The Supreme Lord Krishna and all of His  Vedically  authorised  <i>avataras</i>  or
divine  incarnations  and  expansions   are  fully  <i>saccidananda</i>  possessing
eternal existence, unlimited cognizance and   endless  bliss.  There  is  no
limitation in any of His  forms.  They  are  never  born  neither  are  they
capable of death. They manifest themselves into the material  existence  for
a specific purpose and after a period of  time  they  unmanifest  themselves
again.

Whatever manifestation of infinity there is outwards in external  space  the
same manifestation of infinity is found inwards within the internal  etheric
heart where an infinitesimal portion of Lord Krishna, the  <i>?tma</i>  or  eternal
soul resides of all sentient beings. By the medium of  the  <i>?tma</i>  all  space
including the universes sun and moon etc. are encompassed  within  including
all the demigods such as the  firegod  Agni  and  the  windgod  Vayu.  These
things are not impossible because of the inconceivable power of the  Supreme
Lord. The Vishnu Purana states: Inconceivable indeed  is  the  Supreme  Lord
power, so much so that it is not possible to  resolve  His  inconceivability
by  argument  or  debate.  This   is   because   His   inconceivability   is
transcendental to words, thoughts and even imagination. Never by reason  can
the possible or impossible <i>lilas</i> or divine  pastimes  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna be explained by even  the  most  refined  intellect  in  a  rational
manner.  Otherwise  the  conclusive  evidence  of  Lord  Krishna  performing
phenomenally impossible activities would give rise to  erroneous  inferences
and bizarre conclusions negating His absolute, almighty  paramount  position
as the Ultimate cause and goal of all existence. It would  be  like  someone
attempting to explain a lighting bolt based upon the sound of thunder.   One
sometimes  hears  philosophers  and  intellectuals  speak  about  that  when
transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord are  found  in  even  minuscule
proportions within <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings  there  is  contradiction;  but
this  is  no  way  constitutes  any  defect  in  the  Supreme   Lord.   Such
transcendental qualities found in <i>jivas</i> may seem  to  appear  to  contradict
each other from the material vision of one who  is  unaware  of  the  actual
<i>tattva</i>  or  conclusive  truth.  But   all   seemingly   contradictions   are
harmoniously established within the  Supreme  Lord  and  any  contradictions
perceived in others is completely dependent upon their capacity to  delegate
these qualities and also on the level of consciousness of the perceiver.  It
is only a mater of poetic licence to use the words <i>madhyan</i> or middle in  the
verse as the words <i>na adim</i> meaning no beginning and <i>na antam</i> meaning no  end
clearly includes whatever is between. The Supreme  Lord  Krishnas  <i>visvarupa</i>
is His divine universal form and is not of the form of  the  universe  which
is situated within it like a speck of light.  He  possesses  infinite  forms
which are all unlimited. As all His forms are eternal they are  without  any
ending and thus they are always unlimited.
