As other transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord Krishna such  as  the
<i>pralaya</i>  or  the  waters  of  dissolution  during   universal   destruction,
unlimited people were entering His mouth due to the process of the  creative
cycle. Established in the middle of the battlefield between the Kaurava  and
Pandava armies the <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine  universal  form  with  innumerable
faces and  mouths  turned  towards  both  armies  could  be  seen  devouring
multitudes of warriors continuously entering  those  mouths  in  an  endless
stream. Those who were to die  at  the  commencement  of  the  battle  could
already be seen pulverised by the fierce,  gnashing  teeth  other  perishing
later could be seen just entering these mouths. The sight of this was supra-
subtle and could only be seen by those who were <i>atma-tatva</i> or soul  realised
and could not be seen by others. Like a pot which is broken cannot  be  seen
by ordinary people until it breaks into pieces; the sight of  the  <i>visvarupa</i>
was not visible to those of normal eyes. It can  also  be  compared  to  the
case of King Puru who received the youth and form of his youngest son.  Only
the demigods of medicine being the twin Aswins were  able  to  perceive  his
true old age and not others.
