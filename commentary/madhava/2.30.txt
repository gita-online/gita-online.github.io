How is the living entity indestructible? By  the  auspices  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna, of whom which  a  portion  is  residing  within  every  living
entity as the eternal soul for the protection of every living  entity.  This
is why the living entity is  know  to  be  indestructible  not  due  to  any
strengths of  their  own.  Physical  elements,  actions  and  time  are  the
attributes of all living entities which exist and cease to exist  solely  by
the grace of the Supreme Lord.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
In the Padma Purana it is stated:
<p>
Establishing Himself within the heart of every  living  entity  the  Supreme
Lord protects each and every  living  entity  eternally.  Permanent  objects
like the immortal soul are protected eternally and impermanent objects  such
as the physical body are protected temporarily. In His  manifested  form  or
in His unmanifest form, appearing or not appearing, throughout the  material
existence the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  maintains  and  sustains  all  living
entities for their highest good.
