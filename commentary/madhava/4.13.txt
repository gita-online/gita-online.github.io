Lord Krishna is the origin of the four classifications in Vedic  culture  as
spoken here. Those of <i>sattva guna</i> or the mode of goodness are designated  as
Brahmins or priestly class. Those of mixed <i>sattva guna</i>  and  <i>rajas  guna</i>  or
the mode of passion are known as <i>ksatriyas</i> or  warrior  class<i>.</i>  Those  mixed
with <i>rajas guna</i> and <i>tama guna</i> or the mode of ignorance are  the  <i>vaisyas</i>  or
mercantile class and those in <i>tama guna</i> are the  <i>sudras</i>  or  servant  class.
The actions of Lord always possess <i>shama</i> or tranquillity and <i>dama</i>  or  self-
control in their  performance thus even if He appears to do  nothing  He  is
the performer and if He  appears  to  be  the  performer  He   is  the  non-
performer of His actions. Even  though  He  is  the  origin  of  the  entire
creation He has  no  desires  and  remains  unattached.  Thus  it  has  been
perceived that those who perform  actions  without  desires,  unattached  to
rewards have developed an attribute of the Lord.

Now begins the summation.

The four orders descending in purity from <i>sattva guna</i> to <i>rajas guna</i> to  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna</i> have been described  here.  Those  in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  are  the  Vaisnava
devotees of the supreme  Lord  Krishna  possessing  tranquillity  and  self-
control.  All  others  as  their  <i>sattva</i>  decreases  are  in  <i>tama  guna</i>  in
descending order. Thus <i>sattva  guna</i>  is  determined  by  one's  ability  and
capacity to be a devotee of Lord Krishna and the further away  one  is  from
this the deeper one is covered by <i>tama guna</i> . Thus this  is  the  difference
between them and occurs naturally due to their  character  and  disposition.
The differences and conditions acquired due to birth  should  be  understood
to be merely a designation as devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna has  been
seen to arise and manifest in all four orders of existence. Amongst some  it
is more potent and in others less  so  and  even  these  differences  happen
naturally according to an  individuals  inherent  attributes.  Although  the
resplendent Supreme Lord reveals  He  is  <i>kartaram</i>  or  the  origin  of  all
creation He also reveals He is <i>akartaram</i> or not originated from any  source.
He is independent in Himself and not created from  anything.  The  adjective
<i>api</i> used here is to show this special at tribute that there  is  no  creator
for Him.
