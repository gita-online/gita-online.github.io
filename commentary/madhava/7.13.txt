Why does Arjuna know and is not deluded will be explained by this verse.  To
show Himself as the source of the three <i>gunas</i> being the modes  of  goodness,
passion and nescience, Lord Krishna uses the word <i>mayair</i>  meaning  of  mine.
In regard to the Supreme Lord can be understood in three ways;  as  relating
to the <i>atma</i> or  soul,  as  relating  to  modification  and  as  relating  to
effulgence. It is not used as illusion  here  as  He  speaks  of  <i>gunamayair</i>
meaning My attributes being the three <i>gunas</i> which originate  from  Him.  His
actions apply to His nature as well for  one's  nature  is  compatible  with
one's actions. This is mentioned in the Vyasa Yoga. The word  <i>bhavair</i>  means
conditions and refers to through objects. Objects become perceived by  their
attributes and by this they are seen. The word <i>idam</i> meaning this is used  to
show that the wise are not deluded. Those who recognise their own bodies  as
consisting  of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  and   who   think   that   Lord   Krishna
transcendental body is also similarly formed are certainly deluded  persons.
In the Vyasa Yoga a similar comparison is made as follows: After seeing  the
physical body of Brahma and other demi-gods possessing  attributes;  if  one
believes that the transcendental body of the  Supreme  Lord  is  similar  to
theirs such a person is completely deluded  in  bondage.  The  words  <i>ebhyah</i>
<i>param</i> means above and beyond, referring to the  attributes.  When  referring
to the Supreme Lord of transcendental form it means He is  superior  to  the
three <i>gunas.</i>
