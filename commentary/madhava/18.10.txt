The qualified aspirant  would  never  shun  or  disregard  prescribed  Vedic
activities merely  because  they  contained  an  element  of  discomfort  or
difficulty. Such a qualified one  would  simply  look  at  it  as  <i>tapah</i>  or
penance because the merit of  meritorious  austerities  performed  over  the
course of many lives are not to be wasted in  the  temporary  enjoyments  of
the heavenly planets. The  qualified  aspirant  who  knows  the  fundamental
principles of <i>karma</i> or reactions to actions and <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving
devotion to the Supreme Lord, joyfully surrender all their  actions  without
any desire for rewards for the satisfaction of Lord Krishna or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations and expansions as revealed in Vedic  scriptures.  In
this way one is not enslaved into bondage by <i>karma</i> because prescribed  Vedic
activities  unto  the  Supreme  Lord  do  not  incur  or  accrue  any  <i>karma</i>
whatsoever at any time in any situation or circumstance.
