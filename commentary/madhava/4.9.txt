For the purpose of showing that <i>moksa</i> or complete liberation from the  cycle
of birth and death is  only  possible  through  complete  knowledge  of  His
essence and not by partial knowledge  does  Lord  Krishna  speak  thus.  The
complete knowledge is by the knowledge of the Vedic scriptures. That is  the
way Lord Krishna must be adored. In the Kurma Purana it is stated that:  who
lives their life following the principles advised in  the  Vedic  scriptures
and adores Him accordingly, to those does the Supreme  Lord  reveal  Himself
and not to others. So it is clarified that only proceeding  in  this  manner
is salvation and liberation achieved and not by any other method  digressing
from the Vedic scriptures and this is irrevocable. The  adjective  <i>tattvatah</i>
signifies that the entire scope of  knowledge  is  essential.  Regarding  it
thus this is not contradictory. In the Skanda  Purana  it  has  been  stated
that a human being will not  be  knowledgeable  by  understanding  a  single
principle without first knowing the entirety  of  the  principles  and  even
Shiva is not capable of doing so, therefore one should diligently  endeavour
to be aware of all the principles.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
Only by learning and comprehending  the  knowledge  revealed  in  the  Vedic
scriptures is <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  possible.  By  knowing  and  furthermore
correlating this knowledge from different Vedic texts  and  applying  it  to
one's everyday life will the ultimate attainment  be  gained  and  no  other
way.  It should be clearly understood that the mere knowledge of  the  facts
and details of the Supreme Lords appearance and  divine  pastimes  will  not
enable one to attain liberation from the material existence  without  having
first applied this learning through  the  medium  of  the  Vedic  scriptures
fully into one's life and all that one's life encompasses.
