The difference between the actions of a person of wisdom and those  who  are
ignorant is explained now. The person of wisdom recognises  that  the  whole
material existence is operating under the auspices of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or
the modes of material nature being goodness,  passion  and  nescience.  From
<i>gunas</i> comes the word <i>gunataih</i> which  indicates  one  who  is  influenced  by
their senses. This is the symptom of one who is in ignorance  is  that  they
are controlled by their senses. The sense  are  on  a  lower  platform  then
<i>prakriti</i> or material nature and are influenced by the three <i>gunas.</i>  The  one
who is in ignorance is dominated by the senses assuming that they  are  doer
and cause of their actions and thus stricken with  false  ego  they  perform
all actions with desires and attachment. That person  of  wisdom  recognises
that all actions are but the result of the interaction of  the  three  gunas
and material nature and remaining free of desires  and  attachment  performs
all actions as a matter of duty. This is what Lord Krishna conveys here.
