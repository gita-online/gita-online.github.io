Those who do not know the supreme, paramount position of  Lord  Krishna  and
being  unaware of this do not propitiate Him and worship  Him  oblivious  to
the fact that He alone is Sri Laxmi's lord and master will be verily  cursed
by her even if they offer  her  worship.  Therefore  knowing  the  paramount
supremacy of the Supreme Lord Krishna and the exalted position  of  offering
propitiation to Him one should meditate on His <i>sakti</i> or spiritual,  feminine
potency known as  Sri  Laxsmi.  Being  pleased  by  this  she  will  happily
facilitate devotion to Lord Krishna and after realizing the reality that  He
alone is the  Supreme  Lord  of  all,  one  will  easily  achieve  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence and attain eternal communion with Him  in
the immortal spiritual worlds. Of this there is no doubt.
<p>
One who knows that Sri Laksmi being free from all defects  is  the  eternal,
spiritual, feminine potency of the Supreme Lord and that as His consort  she
is always  propitiating  Him  in  full  wisdom,  such  a  one  is  supremely
superior. Contrarily, great is the distress for those who propitiate  Lasxmi
independently, separate from the Supreme Lord. The Parama Scripture  states:
If Sri Laxsmi is propitiated and worshipped  along  with  the  Supreme  Lord
then great bliss  and  blessings  manifest;  but  if  the  Supreme  Lord  is
considered to be an adjunction to her worship and necessary because  she  is
His consort, then she will not be pleased and  the  opportunity  to  achieve
<i>moksa</i> will be blocked. Therefore only those who propitiate the Supreme  Lord
Krishna and any of His authorised <i>avatars</i> or incarnations and expansions  is
eligible for <i>moksa</i> and Sri  Laksmi  expands  herself  eternally  to  be  the
individual consort  of each of them  whenever  and  wherever  they  manifest
themselves.
