Once again the Supreme Lord Krishna  describes  the  modalities  of  actions
that are essential to be performed by revealing  OM  TAT  SAT.  These  three
divine syllables headed by the transcendental sound  vibration  OM  are  all
verily nomenclatures of the Supreme Lord.  All  over  creation  the  Supreme
Lord pervades by His internal potency with the omnipresence of  OM.  As  the
Supreme Lord is glorified  with  the  greatest  respect  in  all  the  Vedic
scriptures, He is known as TAT. Since the Supreme Lord  is  perfect  without
any defects and completely auspicious, He is known  as  SAT.  The  following
information is confirmed in the  Rig  Veda:  OM  TAT  SAT  is  vibrated  for
propitiation to the Supreme Lord, adherence  to  the  Vedic  ordinances  and
injunctions and honouring creation,  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence and the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul within  all  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings.
