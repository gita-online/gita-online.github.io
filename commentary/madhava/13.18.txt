In verse 21 <i>purusa</i> referred to the <i>jiva</i> or the embodied being. In  verse  23
<i>purusa</i> refers to the Supreme  Lord.  Thus  <i>purusa</i>  can  refer  both  to  the
Supreme and to the <i>jiva</i> when indicating the <i>atma</i> or  immortal  soul  within.
In other situations such an important  conclusion  is  a  contradiction  but
here it has been  succinctly  clarified.  In  the  Saukarayan  scripture  is
stated: The  immortal,  greater  than  the  greatest  is  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna. It is His  greatness  alone  that  all  the  Vedic  scriptures  are
engaged in serving and glorifying. Even appearing otherwise this  is  always
the truth. No contradiction can ever be assumed because  His  transcendental
qualities being eternal are never subject  to rationalisation. Nor is  there
in any Vedic scripture any  evidence  of  any  contradiction  given  by  the
liberated sages and saints ever being seen. So  neither  by  rationalisation
nor from personal experience is any  contradiction  concerning  the  Supreme
Lord  existing.  Therefore  logic,  reason  and  rationalisation  can  never
disprove  what  has  been  established  by  the  Vedic  scriptures.  If   by
rationalisation one attempts to hypothesise  a  supposition  unsupported  by
the Vedic scriptures then it is not  wisdom  but  speculative  nonsense  and
must be completely rejected.  In  the  same  way  anything  proclaimed  that
obscures the eternal truths of the Vedic scriptures  must  also  be  totally
rejected.
<p>
There exists subsidiary summation in  the  Vedic  scriptures.  It  has  been
quoted that  when  one  speaks  the  truth,  even  that  becomes  subsidiary
knowledge. The Supreme Lord Krishna being the source of all is greater  then
the greatest and that alone is the truth. Like the reference  previously  to
His being of  blackish  colour.   If  rationalisation  and  imagination  are
contradictory  to  the  Vedic  scriptures  then  both  rationalisation   and
imagination should be understood as  capable  of  misleading  and  erroneous
because one who is not knowledgeable will be unaware of  the  true  meaning.
Whereas there is no  possibility  of  ever  being  misguided  by  the  Vedic
scriptures as they are  perfect  and  eternal.  The  opportunity  for  being
misled is possible because so many people are completely  oblivious  to  the
purpose of human existence and  totally  unaware  of  the  truth.  Therefore
concocted theories that there must be things contradictory  to  the  Supreme
Lord in the Vedas but somehow they were lost is  ludicrous.  Brahma  himself
has stated that there are neither  any  contradictory  statements  nor  non-
contradictory  rationalisation  in  the  Vedic  scriptures.  Therefore   any
references to non-duality between the Supreme Lord and the <i>jiva</i> or  embodied
being is contradictory and invalid. The Vedanta  Sutras  II.III.IIL  reveal:
To state that the <i>jiva</i> and the Supreme Lord are the same is most  erroneous.
In the Moksa Dharma the sage Janamejaya stated: Unlimited are the <i>jivas</i>  but
the Supreme Lord is one. The sage Visampayana  stated:  No  one  doubts  the
Supreme Lord is one without a second. Unlimited <i>jivas</i> are  born  from  wombs
but the Supreme Lord is self born and eternally endowed  with  the  greatest
qualities. Thus they are both different in nature and not at  all  like  the
dream state. Vedavyasa has written in Vedanta  Sutras  II.II.XXIX  beginning
<i>vaidharmayaccha na svapnadivat</i> meaning: The conceptions of the  dream  state
are not real whereas the experiences from the waking state  are  real.  This
world is not an idea imagined like objects seen in a  dream.  Vedanta  Sutra
II.II.XXVIII states beginning <i>nabhava upalavadheh</i> meaning:  Our  perceptions
and consciousness are the testament that the world exists and is not a  mere
illusion. In the Ayasa section it states: Since  the  world  is  subject  to
modification and always changing it is said to be like a dream; not that  it
is unreal like a dream. An example of  always  changing  is  like  the  four
seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter.
<p>
It should be understood that  it  is  not  an  error  to  meditate  on  <i>aham</i>
<i>brahmasi</i>   meaning  I  am  the  <i>Brahman</i>  as  being  part  of  the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. Because the Supreme Lord is  the  actual
goal of the <i>jiva</i> and by doing so it does  not  imply  sameness  or  becoming
identical to the Supreme Lord and also because that is  the  factual  nature
of the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul. But know that this is not a  principle  method
even though it does not contradict the Vedic reference of the <i>jiva</i>  being  a
refelection. This is confirmed in the Madhuchanda  Scripture  which  states:
The reason the  enlightened  recommend  <i>jivas</i>  to  become  united  with  the
Supreme Lord is because the  <i>atma</i>  has  a  similarity  in  quality  but  not
quantity and thus is as a reflection. In the Agniveshya  section  meditation
on <i>aham brahmasi</i>  insures the result of <i>sarupya moksa</i>  which  is  liberation
into a spiritual form similar to four armed  Vishnu.  So  one  who  achieves
perfection in meditating on <i>aham brahmasi</i>  is  most  assuredly  situated  in
realisation of  the  <i>brahman.</i>  The  Vamana  Purana  even  states  that  <i>aham</i>
<i>brahmasi</i> means I am surrendered to the <i>brahman.</i> Thus being so surrendered  I
am similar unto the Supreme but not as if one is the Supreme. An example  is
one might say a man has the courage of a lion but that does  not  make  that
man a lion. The devotees surrendered to the  Supreme  Lord  understand  that
the <i>atma</i> is a minute reflection of the Supreme Lord and that the <i>atma</i>  is  a
portion of Him. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the master and we are  serving
Him in various wonderful ways. This is what the devotee meditates on.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Those who perceive the <i>purusa</i> as being distinctly different  from  the  <i>jiva</i>
and yet a part of the <i>jiva</i> and can see <i>prakriti</i> as being two  fold  as  both
sentient and insentient and knows the distinctive qualities  and  attributes
of all of  them.  Such  persons  will  be  liberated  from  <i>samsara</i>  or  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death in their present life time  and  promoted
to the spiritual worlds not taking birth in material existence again.
