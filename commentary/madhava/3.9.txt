Living entities are bound to the material existence by their  actions.  This
bondage by actions is spoken of very clearly in the Vedic  scriptures.  Here
Lord Krishna states <i>yagna-arthat</i> meaning actions that are  performed  as  an
offering for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord  without  desiring  reward
are the only actions which are free  from  bondage.  This  is  the  purport.
Lord Krishna also states <i>mukta-sangah</i> meaning free from attachment which  is
the qualifying statement. Inappropriate are actions that crave  desires  due
to attachment.  Appropriate are actions  that  are  free  from  desires  and
attachment. All actions should be performed as a sacrifice  to  the  Supreme
Lord and no sacrifice  should  ever  be  performed  with  an  intention  for
reward. These statements and others are given in the Upanisads.

Now begins the summary.
<p>
The statements of living entities being bound to material  nature  by  their
actions refers to actions which are contrary to divinity  and  righteousness
as delineated in Vedic scriptures. <i>Jaya</i> is a name given to  the  resplendent
Supreme Lord and this name means glory. According to the <i>Barkashruti</i> in  the
word <i>Jaya</i> the <i>Ya</i> signifies <i>yagna.</i> Therefore <i>yagna</i> is the performance of  the
prescribed activities given in the Vedic scriptures for the satisfaction  of
the Supreme Lord.
