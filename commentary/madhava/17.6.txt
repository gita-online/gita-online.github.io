Lord Krishna now delineates that the  attributes  of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  are
commensurate with the three types of <i>jivas</i> or  embodied  beings.  Those  are
the best who are <i>sura</i> or possess the light of consciousness  are  in  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of goodness. Those are the worst who are <i>asura</i> or without  the
light of consciousness and are in <i>tama guna</i> the  mode  of  ignorance.  Those
who are intermediate are mixed with <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion  and  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna.</i> These forms continue even after achieving  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material existence as  well  as  those  who  are  forced  to  enter  hellish
existences. Quite distinct from both of these is <i>paramatma</i>  the  omnipresent
Supreme Soul existing collectively with  the  <i>atma</i>  or  individual  immortal
soul which exists in all <i>jivas</i> and  whose  state  of  consciousness  is  far
superior to even the mind. At least once in every human life this  state  of
consciousness manifests and in rare circumstances is  perceived  within  the
etheric heart  along  with  its  transcendental  form.  This  form  projects
luminosity  and  receives  light  from  its  continuous  interactions   with
<i>paramatma.</i> This spiritual form should be  meditated  on  with  devotion  and
embraced.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Those who are of purified senses and spiritually evolved perceive that  Lord
Krishna is the ultimate reality and the Supreme Lord of all other lords  are
exclusively in <i>sattva guna.</i> These and only these can be considered  devotees
of the Supreme Lord Krishna and His authorised <i>avatars</i> or incarnations  such
as Rama, Vamana, Buddha, Narasingha and His  expansions  such  as  Narayana,
Vasudeva and Vishnu as revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures.  Those  who  perform
<i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotional service to the  Supreme Lord  and  His
incarnations pleases Him very much and delights all  who  are  endowed  also
with the divine nature such as Brahma, Shiva and others. Being blest by  the
presiding deity of knowledge Sri Laksmi-devi who is the eternal consort  and
feminine <i>shakti</i> or potency of the supreme lord one stays firmly situated  in
<i>sattva guma</i> and engage in pure worship. They will  achieve  <i>moksa</i>  in  their
lifetime.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Those who are in doubt about the Supremacy of Lord Krishna and are wary  of
surrendering to Him and do not understand thet He is the Supreme Lord,  find
themselves  gullible  to  follow  inferior  doctrines   and   receptive   to
worshipping  perishable   gods  without  ever   understanding   the   actual
<i>taratamya</i> or gradations involved, are rooted in  <i>raja  guna</i>  and  engage  in
worship of demoniac entities accepting  them  as  their  supreme  being.  In
their next life they must suffer interminably in the foulest of hells.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Those who are indifferent and consider Lord Krishna as equal to  other  gods
of other faiths, without using their  intelligence  to  determine  that  the
doctrines of all other faiths are missing knowledge of the <i>atma</i> or  immortal
soul,  knowledge  of  <i>karma,</i>  knowledge  of  reincarnation,   knowledge   of
liberation and is beyond compare are  drowning  in  <i>tama  guna</i>  and  worship
ghosts and spirits, abstract conceptions along  with  illusory  beliefs.  In
the next life they will take birth as animals.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Those who consider the omnipresent Supreme Lord who pervades  all  existence
and resides within the etheric heart of all living  entities  as  less  than
other gods will go to obscure worlds of  darkness.  They  will  be  born  as
<i>pischasas</i> or goblins and <i>raksasas</i> or demons.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Those who engage in extreme austerities according to  the  Vedic  scriptures
out of pride and arrogance for the  desire  of  obtaining  material  rewards
such as power, wealth, fame, etc. petition the demigods for various  rewards
and Sri Laksmi for wealth as if they were independently awarding  the  boons
desired. Such ones fail to realise that whatever they have received has  had
to be sanctioned by the Supreme Lord.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Those who refrain from performing worship according to  the  ordinances  and
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and yet do not engage in any  activities
prohibited by the Vedic scriptures will  have  the  opportunity  to  achieve
<i>moksa</i> if by the mercy of a devotee they happen  to  propitiate  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna or any of His incarnations and expansions. By  this  they  will
free themselves from the illusory energy and eventually attain  the  Supreme
Lord. Thus it is clear and not  necessary  to  elaborate  that  one  who  is
worshipping the Supreme Lord in accordance with the  Vedic  scriptures  will
definitely attain Lord Krishna without a doubt.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
From observation of the food that one eats it can determined  which  of  the
three <i>gunas a jiva</i> is situated in. The same observation holds true  for  the
type of worship one engages in and for all activities one's position can  be
established. Those in <i>sattva guna</i> are observed  humbly  performing  luminous
activities in the  mode  of  goodness.  Those  in  <i>raja  guna</i>  can  be  seen
ostentatiously engaging in fruitive  activities  for  gain  and  profit  and
those in <i>tama guna</i> are noticed drearily enacting pagan  rituals  merely  out
of habit.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The Supreme Lord Krishna is known by the threefold symbols <i>OM Tat  Sat</i>.  His
personal sound manifestation vibrates as the transcendental sound of <i>OM</i>.  As
He is omnipresent in every letter and syllable of the Vedas,  <i>OM</i>  is  always
chanted at the commencement of every Vedic ceremony  and  ritual.  Therefore
with the pronouncement of the word <i>OM</i> by the Vaisnavas and the brahmanas  in
salutation  and  glorification  of  Him,   all   rituals,   ceremonies   and
propitiation proceed. The Vedic ordinances  and  injunctions  are  eternally
established by  Lord  Krishna  and  are  known  as  <i>Sat</i>  denoting  unlimited
consciousness. Activities that do not  propitiate  Lord  Krishna  and  begin
with <i>OM</i> are practiced by the <i>a-suras</i> meaning  those  without  the  light  of
consciousness. All their efforts however prodigious are merely  mundane  and
are known as <i>a-sat</i> having limited  consciousness.   Anyone  pronouncing  the
word <i>OM</i> without initiation, without faith and without  knowing  the  meaning
thereof is also situated as  an  <i>asura.</i>  Since  the  results  of  all  Vedic
rituals and ceremonies are allotted wholly to the Supreme Lord and <i>moksa</i>  is
awarded exclusively by the grace of His sanction, He is  known  as  <i>Tat</i>  and
because He pervades everywhere internally and externally and  possesses  all
auspiciousness, he is also know as <i>Tat</i>.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Absence of the Vedic ordinances and injunctions and avoiding recognition  of
the Supreme  Lord  have  been  determined  to  be  similar.  That  which  is
practiced  without  recognition  to  the  Supreme  Lord  is  that  which  is
practiced  without  following  the  Vedic  scriptures  and  that  which   is
practiced without  following  the  Vedic  scriptures  is  practiced  without
recognition of the Supreme Lord. The  Shabda  Nirnaya  states:  Making  Lord
Krishna the primal focus by which  all  activities  revolve  around  is  the
method and the goal. The Paingi  scripture  confirms:  Authentic  scriptures
are those that are established for the sole purpose of glorifying  knowledge
of the Supreme Lord Krishna and establishing communion with Him.
