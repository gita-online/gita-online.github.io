Lord Krishna explains the results of worship according to the choice of  the
worshipper. It is up to each human being to  exercise  their  gift  of  free
will and use their discrimination. Since the Supreme Lord  is  the  ultimate
goal of all worship,  His  propitiation  is  encouraged  by  the  result  of
attaining Him.
