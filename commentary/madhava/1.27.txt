It is as if my mind is unsteady. With these words of dejection the  weakness
of Arjuna is disclosed and it can be understood that he is close  to  losing
consciousness. He says: in in this  war  I  am  seeing  the  consequense  of
opposing results<i>.</i> This means that even if he were  victorious  in  obtaining
the kingdom he would not feel any satisfaction. To  the  contrary  he  would
feel just the opposite, he would feel remorse. Here in this sense  the  word
<i>nimittani</i> meaning inauspicious omens is not given as  a  symptom  but  as  a
result.
