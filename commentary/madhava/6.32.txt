The word ayatih means one who does not earnestly endeavour.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
The special meaning Lord Krishna is giving is denoted by the word ayatih or
one who does not endeavour by the regulated practice of meditation or
contrarily one who abstains from the practise of meditation that was
already begun. The words aprapya yoga-samsiddhim mean without achieving the
complete potential of yoga or the science of the individual consciousness
attaining communion with ultimate consciousness. Although for the word yoga
there is the established meaning, perfection in meditation is the inferred
meaning here. Thus failure in perfecting meditation is not contradictory.
