Lord Krishna clarifies  this  theme  in  this  verse.  One  who  experiences
objects of the senses without one being attached to them or having the
conceptions of this is mine or I am  this  body,  such  a  one  verily
situated in a state of perfect peace and they alone attain liberation.
This is the meaning.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
With  the  determination  of  renouncing  all  inappropriate  objects,   one
abandons all sense objects. To assume that which is not under  ones  control
is under ones control is deluded  egotism.  Rejecting  egotism  in  all  its
forms is understood to be under the control of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
This is the goal to fully strive for.
