Lord Krishna gives the six demerits that are part  of  the  demoniac  nature
and  are  formidable  obstacles  obstructing  all  progress   in   spiritual
advancement. The word <i>damah</i> or  ostentatious  denotes  hypocrisy,  mendacity
and  lack  of  religiosity.  <i>Darpah</i>  is  pride  erroneously   exuding   from
intoxication of position, wealth and power.  The  word  <i>krodah</i>  means  anger
resulting from frustration causing animosity and the impetus to  injure  and
harm others by <i>parusyam</i> or cruelty and harshness without any mercy. This  is
a defect especially found in  sovereigns  and  rulers  due  to  <i>abhimanh</i>  or
extreme egotism in  the  illusion  that  they  are  the  most  powerful  and
worshipable instead of the Supreme Lord. Thus their mentality being  deluded
is  <i>ajnanam</i>  or  ignorance,  void  of  actual  knowledge  and  destitute  in
discrimination of what is eternal and what is temporary.
