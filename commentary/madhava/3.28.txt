Knowing the difference between <i>prakriti</i> or material  nature  and  the  <i>gunas</i>
being the modes of goodness, passion and nescience and  their  influence  of
the senses, Lord Krishna declares is a  <i>tattva-vit</i>  or  a  person  of  Vedic
knowledge. The word <i>gunesu</i> is referring  to  the  sense  objects  and  their
attributes such as form. The attributes that arise from the impulses of  the
<i>atma</i> or soul are known as primary and they are without reactions and do  not
bind one to <i>samsara</i> the cycle of birth and death.
