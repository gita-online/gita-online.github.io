The method of destroying the great enemy known as <i>kama</i> or  lust  is  learned
through the knowledge of Vedic scriptures  received  by  the  words  of  the
spiritual master. Controlling the five senses is the key step  allowing  one
to benefit from this Vedic knowledge. Without restraint of  the  senses  one
has no possibility of conquering  <i>kama.</i>  The  senses  are  superior  to  the
physical body, the mind is superior to senses, the intellect is superior  to
the mind and the <i>atma</i> or  soul  is  superior  to  the  intellect.  <i>Moksa</i>  or
liberation from the cycle of birth and death is not possible  from  studying
various verses in diverse Vedic scriptures in  different  contexts.  In  the
<i>Gunopasamhara</i> section of Brahma Sutras it is stated that  the  Supreme  Lord
should be meditated upon after recollecting in the mind the entire range  of
attributes and qualities possessed by the Supreme Lord.  In the Vedas  which
are  <i>apaurusaheya</i>  which  means  not  of  human  origins  and  also  in  the
Mahabharata and Garuda Purana it is stated that:  Whatever  attributes  have
been revealed in the Vedic scriptures regarding  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
and His authorised incarnations and whoever is  able  to  actually  perceive
Him realising these attributes in their hearts, in such persons  alone  does
<i>bhakti</i> or devotion become established and never to others.
<p>
Therefore the Supreme Lord Krishna should be understood to  be  superior  to
everything as He existed before the creation of everything.  One  who  fully
understands this and acts in accordance with this understanding is  eligible
for <i>moksa</i> and never others. The previous  verse  is  not  referring  to  the
living being because the words <i>bhudher yah  paratas tu sah</i> mean: that  which
is superior to the intellect is the <i>atma.</i> This is  because  the  desire  for
sense gratification is overcome by <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation and  also
without perceiving the Supreme Being how will the  living  being  expect  to
overcome <i>kama.</i> Thus it is clear that knowledge  pertaining  to  the  Supreme
Lord is what is important. The word <i>atmanam</i> means  the  mind  and  the  word
<i>atmana</i> means the intellect and they are for realising the <i>atma.</i>
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Among living beings the demigods are superior to humans. Indra is the  chief
of the demigods. Shiva the presiding deity of the mind and ego  is  superior
to Indra. Above Shiva is Brahma the  presing  diety  of  the  intellect  and
discrimination. Superior to Brahma are all the <i>avatars</i>  expansions  of  Lord
Krishna in the spiritual realms and superior to them  is  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna Himself. There is nothing equal or superior to Krishna. Knowing  the
order of gradation and destroying the powerful enemy of  <i>kama</i>  at  the  very
root one becomes qualified for <i>moksa</i> and  attain  the  spiritual  worlds  of
Lord Krishna which  are  imperceptible  to  the  vision  and  conception  of
humans. An important purpose of Vedic scriptures is to  show  the  order  of
gradation. The function of the higher deity cannot be performed by  a  lower
deity. To show their area of predominance they each  have  their  respective
places and assigned function. In some cases a deity  on  a  lower  level  is
seen to be relegating the  duties  of  a  higher  level;  but  this  can  be
understood in the same way that a son sometimes relegates the  duties  of  a
father. The Shabda Nirnaya states: traditionally the  use  of  such  similes
repeatedly are able to convey the conclusive meaning for comprehension.  The
Brahma  Tarka  states:  that  where  similar  examples  are   repeated   the
similarity of their meanings  is  understood  and  becomes  conclusive  from
continuous hearing.
