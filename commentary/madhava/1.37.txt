<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>
<p>
It is a sinful act even to think about or resolve  the  killing  of  friends
and relatives. So being repentant for such a resolve this  verse  is  given.
Here the word <i>bata</i> meaning how strange is utilised as a preposition  in  the
sense of uncertainty.
