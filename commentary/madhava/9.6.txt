It has been stated that one thing  may  abide  in  another  thing;  but  the
attributes of one need not be possessed by the  other.  This  is  what  Lord
Krishna explains with the word <i>vayuh</i> or wind which abides  in  space  as  an
example of how both the wind and the space are  separate  andor  the  source
unaffected by each other, in order to show His  relationship  with  the  all
things in material existence.
