Obstinately clinging to one's limited  viewpoint   without  considering  the
vision of others is a symptom of <i>tama guna</i> the mode of  ignorance.  Also  if
one supposes that after acquiring wisdom and thereafter achieving  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence that a <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  is  independent
when  in  reality  even  a  liberated  being  is  completely  dependent  and
subservient to the Supreme Lord, this conception would be  a  great  offence
and cause demerits. Again assuming that nothing exists beyond  the  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being and what one perceives is illusory  and  unmeritorious.  What
need then is there to emphasise the fact that the acquisition  of  illogical
hypothesis and untenable suppositions is a source of great degradation.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
Irrational consciousness obtained from distorted  and  perverse  conceptions
far removed from perceptions of the  ultimate  truth  have  no  benefit  for
anyone in this life or the next and are fully situated in <i>tama  guna.</i>  There
is an aphorism that knowledge must be received from a proper source  in  the
proper order. This being  the  case  there  is  no  necessity  in  itemising
degraded and  depraved  conceptions.  The  cause  for  such  degradation  of
consciousness  is  miniscule  knowledge  and  limited  understanding   which
consequently develops acute unawareness. For a <i>jiva</i> to think  of  themselves
as omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent on the same level as  the  Supreme
Lord or entertain the illusion that they are the same as  the  Supreme  Lord
is the height of folly and completely devoid of all rationality  and  common
sense. Such erroneous conclusions which stem from  irrational  consciousness
deprives actual knowledge of its elevated position and  is  always  immersed
in <i>tama  guna.</i>  It  is  seen  that  those  who  follow  teachings,  beliefs,
doctrines and philosophies opposed to the  eternal  and  imperishable  Vedic
scriptures are primarily <i>mayavadis</i> or  impersonalists  whose  religions  are
designed in such a way that they are bereft of any actual conception of  the
Supreme  Lord  to  comprehend  and  so  they  either  follow  a  creationist
conception without purpose or a concoct a supreme  being  without  qualities
and attributes.
