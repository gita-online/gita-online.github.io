Once a person sins have been eradicated then  these  are  the  things  which
transpire. As such demerits diminish the  feeling  of  alienation  from  the
<i>atma</i> or soul also diminishes. Lord Krishna  uses  the  words  <i>chinna-dvaitha</i>
meaning uprooting concepts of dualism such as pleasure and  pain,   joy  and
sorrow, success and failure etc. which give rise to  doubts  and  delusions.
How are they to be uprooted? By the  sword  of  knowledge  in  the  form  of
renouncing all desires for sense  gratification  and  perceiving  the  <i>atmas</i>
distinctive nature along with the <i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading
all  existence.  The  eternal  <i>atma</i>  which  evaporates  all  alienation   is
omniscient, knowing past, present and future. Therefore by  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul one is able to enact their individual  consciousness
attain communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness  and  with  all  doubts
removed realise that the destruction of the alienation from  the  individual
<i>atma</i> and the distinctive nature of  <i>paramatma</i> or  the  Supreme  Soul  reveal
two completely different realities.
