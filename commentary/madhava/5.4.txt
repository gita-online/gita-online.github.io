Renunciation is certainly essential for the acquisition of spiritual  wisdom
which has been stated in Vedic scriptures as  being  impossible  to  acquire
for one who is unable to relinquish enjoying the objects of the  senses.  If
this is the case then how can it be assumed that  renunciation  is  inferior
to <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic  activities.  Therefore  Lord  Krishna  is
explaining that both are inherent in each other and not  contradictory.  One
who observes a <i>yagna</i> or offerings of worship to propitiate the Supreme  Lord
and experiencing the smoke arising from the ghee and seed grains offered  to
the fire reflects that  the  <i>yagna</i>  is  not  sanctified  due  to  its  being
performed for desires of the rewards upon its completion. But for  the  same
<i>yagna</i> being performed without desires but solely  for  the  propitiation  of
the Supreme  Lord  is  considered  the  highest  wisdom.  Those  that  think
otherwise are not conversant  with  the  Vedic  scriptures  and  thus  their
speculations do not need to be considered.
