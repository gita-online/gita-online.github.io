One whose consciousness is firmly established in  transcendence  is  sthita-
prajna. Such consciousness can  be  perceived  by  such  characteristics  of
speech known as bhasa. Arjuna raises  this  question  to  determine  whether
characteristics other than those  mentioned  previously  are  present  here.
Firmly established in spiritual  intelligence  is  emphasized  here.  Arjuna
refers to Lord Krishna here as Keshava. Ka refers to Brahma and  Isa  refers
to Rudra and as he is the source of both  of  them  he  is  called  Keshava.
Another example is also  given  in  the  Harivamsa  in  connection  to  Lord
Krishna during Rudras travel to Mt. Kailas. It says Hiranyagarbha or  Brahma
of the golden womb is Ka and Sankara is Isa and you as ordained of  creation
are known as Keshava.  Kim asit means how and for what purpose does  one  so
situated  recline?  It  is   not   that   Arjuna   is   unaware   of   these
characteristics. Earlier kings and emperors  of  the  world  and  yogis  and
sages and even demi-gods would ask such questions even if they knew  of  the
eternal principles of righteousness as well as esoteric  subjects  that  are
mystical and confidential. These esoteric subjects  are  not  comprehensible
by those lacking spiritual intelligence. So it says in the Puranas.

Now begins the summation.

What is the manner of speech and how does one speak and in  what  mood  does
one speak who  situated  with  spiritual  intelligence  is  in  transcendent
consciousness. One who possesses  equanimity  of  consciousness  is  without
contradictions in their consciousness.
