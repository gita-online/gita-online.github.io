Since Lord Krishna is the ultimate of all He is <i>vedyam</i> the goal to know  and
attained. This is also confirmed in the Vasistha section of the  Sama  Veda.
Asked why is Lord Krishna declared to be the ultimate.  It  is  because  the
light emanating from His transcendental body is  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence and  knowledge  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  is  the
goal. This is realised by those who have  neutralised  their  <i>karma</i>  freeing
themselves from reactions to previous actions and who  have  achieved  <i>moksa</i>
or liberation from material existence. The Supreme Lord is the  only  refuge
for those who have achieved <i>moksa</i> and for those still helplessly  caught  in
<i>samsara</i> or the endless cycle of birth and death. At the  time  of  universal
dissolution the entire creation becomes dissolved within Him,  therefore  He
is the resting place. The Rig Veda states: Having  pure  vision  the  entire
creation can be seen  being  manifested  within  the  Supreme  Lord  by  His
external <i>sakti</i> known as Maya the deluding feminine energy.
