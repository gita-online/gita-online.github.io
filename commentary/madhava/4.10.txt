By completely renouncing passion, fear and anger  and  subsequently  adoring
the Supreme Lord many attained <i>moksa</i> or liberation. <i>Man-maya</i> means  complete
abidance and refuge in the Lord in all situations.

<i>Mayam</i> means making the Lord the central focus of one's life as  the  primary
objective. One who knows the Supreme Primacy of the Lord's position  becomes
eventually aware of His transcendental integral form. Only  those  who  know
the Supreme Resplendent Lord  thus  are  qualified  for  liberation  and  no
others. Being aware of His integral form indicates attaining  their  eternal
spiritual form similar to His in quality but not quantity.
