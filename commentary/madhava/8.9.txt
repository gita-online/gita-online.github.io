Now Lord Krishna speaks about the goal in this verse. The word  <i>kavim</i>  means
omniscient, one who knows everything. The Brahma Purana states: The  Supreme
Being is <i>kavi</i> or all knowing. He is the seer of everything because He  knows
all things. The word <i>dhaaratam</i> means sustainer, maintainer. What  does  this
also indicate? That the Supreme Being is the  maintainer  and  sustainer  of
supreme wisdom for those living  entities  so  inclined.  The  Moksa  Dharma
states: Commencing with Brahma the architect of the universes and Rudra  the
termination principle of the universes, all by  the  grace  of  the  Supreme
Personality desiring the Ultimate Reality achieve their goal. He is  <i>acintya</i>
or inconceivable  by  the  mind  and  senses.  He  is  <i>tamasah  parastat</i>  or
transcendental to the constraints of  the  physical  body  as  well  as  the
unmanifest, far beyond the scope of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum
pervading all existence which is in obscurity and  darkness.  The  Pippalada
Samhita states: Death is indeed <i>tamas</i>  or  darkness  but  the   illumination
emanating from the immortal form of the Supreme Being is  transcendental  to
the dark pale of death.
