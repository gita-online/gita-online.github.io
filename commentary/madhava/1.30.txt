<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>
<p>
If it is put forth that in killing aggressors there  is  sin  that  argument
can be nullified because in the Vasistha Samhita  III.XI  beginning:  <i>agnido</i>
<i>garadas caiva sastra-panir</i> it is stated that  the  following  six  types  of
aggressors can be slain.
<p>
1) one who administers poison
2) one who commits arson
3) one who attacks with deadly weapons
4) one who steals ones wealth
5) one who usurps another's property
6) and one who kidnaps another's wife
<p>
All these aggressors can immediately be slain without  any  sinful  reaction
incurred and this confirmed in Manu Samhita VIII.CCCL  beginning  <i>atatayinam</i>
<i>ayantam hanyad</i> meaning: Without hesitation such aggressors may be  slain  as
there is no sin in killing them. It is factual that every one of  these  six
aggressions has been previously perpetrated by Duryodhana and his  brothers,
so all of them certainly should be slain.  To  answer  this  Arjuna  replies
that it would be sinful to kill friends, relatives and superiors.
<p>
His reasoning is because the killing of aggressors is  found  in  the  moral
codes of <i>Niti</i> sastra whereas in <i>Dharma</i> sastra it is stated that  one  should
not cause harm to any living creature. Since <i>Dharma sastra</i>  is  superior  to
<i>Niti sastra</i> the killing of revered elders such as Drona, Bhishma and  others
can only be the cause of sin. Without  the  elders  and  the  relatives  the
enjoyment of sovereignty will not be palatable rather will  only  result  in
remorse. By Arjuna addressing Lord Krishna as <i>Madhava</i> the controller of  all
wealth and opulence, Arjuna's intention is to ask why the Lord  of  Sri  the
goddess of fortune would encourage him to fight a battle that will  be  full
of gore and death, devoid of all wealth and opulence.
