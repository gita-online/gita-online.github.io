In  these  two  verses  Lord  Krishna  describes  the  perfected  method  of
meditaion for achieving <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul and <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence. The method commences by  turning  inward
with the mind away from all external sense objects  associated  with  sight,
sound, taste, smell and touch. Then one fixes the vision internally  between
the eyebrows while simultaneously slowly restraining the inward and  outward
breaths until they merge into one and pause themselves of their  own  accord
in the state know as <i>kumbhaka.</i>

Now begins the summation.

<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The one who has not received <i>moksa</i> or liberation while  aspiring  for  <i>moksa</i>
nevertheless has acquired qualities aspiring for <i>moksa.</i>  Thus  human  beings
acquiring the qualities of <i>moksa</i> acquire spiritual knowledge and  eventually
achieve <i>moksa</i> by this spiritual knowledge.
