What is so special that differentiates Lord Krishna from all other gods?  He
clarifies this by the word <i>avyaktam</i> meaning transcendent explaining  by  the
words  <i>vyaktim  apannam</i>  accepting  a  human  like  form  for  His  <i>lila</i>  or
phenomenal  pastimes.  Superior  and  transcendental  to  <i>prakriti</i>  or   the
material substratum pervading physical existence, He has never  any  actions
to perform. The Supreme Lord who is  eternally  blissful  is  considered  as
having  a  spiritual  body  with  personality,  qualities  and   attributes.
Therefore  the  Vedic  scriptures  have  stated  that  without  knowing  the
ultimate truth of the Supreme Lord's existence everyone remains deluded.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The Supreme Lord is transcendental to <i>prakriti</i> whereas the <i>jiva</i> or  embodied
living entity is not. Those who believe that there is equality between  them
or that there is a dependency  shared between them surely in the  next  life
go to the dark worlds of ignorance in obscurity.
