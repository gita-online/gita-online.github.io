That knowledge which is contrary to the Vedic scriptures and the  antithesis
to the omnipotent absolute authority of the Supreme Lord  Krishna  is  known
to be situated in <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion. The words <i>nana-bhavan</i>  mean
multiplicity of natures. Those who are oblivious that the  Supreme  Lord  is
the one underlying reality pervading all creation,  simultaneously  existing
within the etheric heart of every <i>jiva</i> or embodied being in  existence;  are
situated in <i>raja guna.</i> 
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
If one is unaware of the Supreme Lord  Krishna's  unparalleled  position  as
the absolute sovereign ruler of all existence, or is  bewildered  about  His
indomitable, paramount position or thinks that any other  god  can  manifest
creation  or  are   influenced   by   inferior   concepts,   doctrines   and
philosophies concerning creation,  the  <i>jiva</i>  and  the  Supreme  Lord;  such
erroneous and fallacious thinking devoid of a connection to  reality  impels
one to obstinately and belligerently  try  to  justify  and  validate  their
illusory belief systems. Such fools of  miniscule  knowledge  and  misguided
intelligence are unable  to  mount  a  rational  argument  supporting  their
viewpoint and odiously cling to their bogus suppositions and faulty  claims.
