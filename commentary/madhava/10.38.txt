In whatever forms the  manifestations  of  majesty,  greatness,  beauty  and
power are seen,  they  should  be  known  as  minuscule  fractions  of  Lord
Krishna's <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental opulence.   Manifesting  as  the
<i>brahman</i>  He  becomes  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence.
Manifesting as Brahma He becomes the ruler  of  the  aggregate  of  the  330
million demigods. Having been established as the  predominant  goal  in  the
Sama Veda, He is know as Sama, predominant in the  Vedas.  Similarly  He  is
established as <i>aswattha</i> or immutable to bequeath eminence  to  the  <i>Aswattha</i>
<i>Tree</i> known as the Banyan Tree and He was called  <i>Aswattha</i>  and  other  names
etc. to give recognition to their  special  qualities  which  manifest  from
Him. Thus the principle of manifesting <i>vibhuti.</i> It  is  clear  and  apparent
that the Supreme Lord Krishna's avatars or incarnations and  expansions  are
different from His vibhuti  and  are  also  distinctly  different  from  the
demigods and any jiva or embodied being. Realisation  of  the  Supreme  Lord
can  manifest  internally  or  externally  in  two  ways  as  either  direct
perception or as supra-sensory illumination.

The realisation of Lord Krishna's expansions such as Narayana, Rama or
Vishnu are direct perception possessing transcendental qualities and
attributes and eternal spiritual forms. They are completely above and
beyond the demigods, the jivas or embodied beings and material nature.
However abiding in material objects and energising the distinctive nature
in them along with the complete material existence, when perceived is known
as supra sensory illumination. Because Lord Krishna possesses all of the
attributes of paramatma the Supreme Soul, He is known as Paramatma. Because
He is self luminous like the rays of the sun, He is known as the sun. Since
He causes rain laden clouds to shower He is known as Marici. Being in
equanimity to all He is known as Sama. Being the bestower of pleasure He is
known as the moon. Being the knower of everything He is the Vedas. Since He
abides everywhere He is Vasu. Being conscious of all things He is cit.
Being the purifier He is known as Pavana the wind which purifies. Being
ever immutable He is Mt. Meru. Being the holder of all He is the ocean as
all land floats upon it. He is Skanda who defeated all adversaries. He is
Bhrigu being adorable. He is the recitation of Vedic mantras being
gloified. He is Yagna the worship and propitiation. He is Hayagriva, the
horse incarnation. He is Airavata, the lord of the elephants. He is the
protector of the Sri the goddess of fortune. Since He grants all the
desires of nara or man He is Narada. Being the guardian of Hri and Sri both
dual forms of Laksmi, He is knownas Himalaya. Being unassailable by
adversaries He is vajra the thunderbolt. Since He gives protection to the
obedient He is Garuda. Because abiding in the heart of all beings He gives
peace He is Vasuki. Being the enjoyer of all desires He is Kandarpa or
Kamadeva the god of love. Since He is the knower of all that is to be
known, He is Aryama. He is time the knower of all knowledge. Being pleased
with the devotees He is Varuna. Having two forms one internal and one
external He is known as dvanda or dual. Granting limited knowledge to the
uninitiated He is the makara. Being the controller He is Yama the demigod
in charge of death. Being extremely devoted He is Prahlad. Being the Lord
of all seeking beings He is the Lord of all beings. Being the renunciate of
samsara the perpetual cycle of birth and death He is Jahnavi or Ganga-devi.
Being the Lord of the atma or soul He is Adhytma. Knowing all He is wisdom.
In debates He is conclusive logic. Being eulogised He is fame, speech and
wealth. Since He is always remembered He is memory. Being knowledgeable He
is intellect. Being compassionate He is mercy. In sport He is gambling.
Being the refuge of the singers He is the Gayatri. Being ever victorious He
is vitue. Being the punisher He is the rod of chastisement. Since He has
great attributes He is called Brihat Sama. Since He is omniscient He is
Ushana.
<p>
Being the knower of all wisdom He is awareness. Being secretive He is
silence. On the path to the final goal He is perseverance. Beings pleased
with understanding He is Kaplia. Being the best among humans He is
Vedavyasa. Being all pervasive He is Vishnu. Thus dwelling within all
beings and having innumerable qualities the resplendent Lord Krishna is the
glory of the glory. Among the constellations with different qualities Lord
Krishna as the moon takes precedence over them such as the stars and other
planets as the moon has the predominant influence over the Earth. Among
those of similar attributes such as the demigods He takes predominance over
them all as Shankara or Shiva who is more then all of them. Among the jivas
or embodied being He bestows eminence only to very few such as Brihaspati,
Bhrgu and Arjuna. Among the demigods the primary creator after Vishnu is
Brahma and there is no jiva equal to Him. In the performance of yagnas
conscious awareness is superior. Of weapons Sudarsan Cakra is superior and
of the Vedas the Rig Veda is spoken of as Supreme. In other places it is
stated the Sama Veda is Supreme but not because of its attributes but
because of the divinty presiding over it. The presiding dieties of the Rig
Veda are the saktis Laksmi, Sarsawati and Parvati. Whereas the presiding
diety of the Sama Veda is Shiva. Still accordingly whatever is proper
following the Vedic etiquette is to be accepted.
<p>
Knowledge that the Supreme Lord is everything verifies the reality that
there is nothing which exits apart from Him. Conceptions of duality are
strictly on the empirical platform of material existence. Once the
Universal Form has been perceived by Arjuna's consciousness  and he has
total awreness such conceptions of duality will cease to arise. Then he
will see that everything existing is different manifestations of the
Supreme Lord. As snow, ice and steam are nothing more then different
manifestations of water.
<p>
om purnam adah purnam idam purnat purnam udacyate
purnasya purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate
<p>
The Supreme Lord is perfect and complete and because He is perfect and
complete all that emanates from Him are perfectly complete. Whatever is
produced from the complete is complete in itself. Because He is complete
even though unlimited completeness emantes from Him, He remains eternally
complete.
