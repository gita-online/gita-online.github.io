Before Lord Krishna explained in detail the questions posed  in  verse  four
concerning the characteristics and nature of the <i>ksetra.</i>  Now  He  describes
in brief the modifications of <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum  pervading
material existence and <i>purusa</i> the  supreme  in  the  form  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or
immortal soul. The modifications of <i>prakriti</i> are the three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes
of goodness, passion and ignorance. At the  time  of  universal  dissolution
whatever accumulation is remaining from <i>prakriti</i> a small part of  that  will
be from these <i>gunas.</i> In the Madhuchanda section it has been  mentioned  that
this small portion  of  accumulation  will  constitute  action  as  well  as
inaction. As desires are modifications of the <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being  the
<i>gunas</i> are modifications of <i>prakriti.</i> Even though <i>prakriti</i> is the  source  of
the <i>gunas</i> it is uninfluenced by them as they are in seed form and  ready  to
burst into sprout once they enter the material manifestation.  They  do  not
come into existence like transient desires but are  potentially  established
in the act of dissolution. The entire  material  creation  which  cyclically
manifests and dissolves has inherent within it traces  of  the  potentiality
of recreation programmed into its atomic substratum. Thus all  phenomena  in
manifestation and dissolution is influenced by the <i>gunas</i> and  reabsorbed  by
its potentiality back into the matrix of existence exactly the  way  it  was
previously.

Now begins the summation.

The separation  of  the  words  <i>prakritim  purusancaiva</i>  differentiates  the
animate and sentient  <i>purusa</i> and its immortal soul from  the  inanimate  and
insentient <i>prakriti.</i> The modifications such as desire and  attraction  along
with the attributes of goodness, passion and ignorance being  different  are
mentioned separately although both arise solely from  <i>prakriti.</i>  The  <i>purusa</i>
which  exemplifies  the  Supreme   Lord   is   completely   independent   of
<i>prakriti</i> and thus is exclusively referred to as the  witness,  the  monitor,
the ordainer, etc.
