The avyakta the unmanifest and aksara the indestructible is the resplendent
Supreme Lord, Krishna Himself, upon whom attaining there is no more
returning to samsara the perpetual cycle of birth and death. The Garuda
Purana states: The avyakta is the Supreme Lord Himself. It shows the use of
the word dhama or abode as also denoting the resplendent form of the
Supreme Lord. Showing that the resplendent Supreme Lord's form and abode
are both indicated such are the confidential meanings understood by those
of spiritual wisdom.
