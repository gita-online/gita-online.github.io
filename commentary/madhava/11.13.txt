Beholding the Supreme Lord Krishna's  brilliant  and  magnificent  immutable
equanimity in His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form comprised of  boundless
marvels and unlimited wonders establishing  His  infinite  forms  all  fully
endowed with <i>saccidanda</i> or eternal  consciouness,  unlimited  knowledge  and
endless bliss. These  forms  are  all  contained  within  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna's spiritual body and exist  simultaneously  one  and  distinct  from
Him. His universal form, His eternal form and so many other forms were  seen
by Arjuna. So since both singular and plural words  were  used  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna is established to be  distinctly  singular  as  well  as  being
distinctly unlimited with innumerable forms.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The original form of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  eternal,  graced  with
flute, gunga beads and peacock feather. This singular form is  inconceivable
because of the splendor of it being the exclusive source of all  <i>avatars</i>  or
divine incarnations  and  expansions  possessing   unlimited  transcendental
forms. Where the  absence  of  separation  is  fully  established  then  the
individual   forms   assume   phenomenal   activities   with   extraordinary
attributes. Yet Lord Krishna is the Ultimate controller of  each  and  every
one of them and as their essence from Him the one  becomes  the  many.  Even
though  eternity  is  His  special  quality  He  still   sometimes   appears
simultaneously in different <i>lil?s</i> or  divine  pastimes  which  while  having
variegated  and  diverse  forms  are  similarly  eternal  as  well.  Through
personal experience and devout contemplation,  subsequent  realization  will
manifest and  the  distinctive  spiritual  essence  of  everything  will  be
discovered. This essence may be perceived by meditation,  by  reflection  or
by enlightenment. But the variation in form of the essence is  not  distinct
or separate from the essence itself for  if  the  form  of  the  essence  is
separate from the essence then it would not be one and eternal. Also if  the
form of the  essence  is  not  knowable  then  the  essence  would  also  be
unknowable and as such would not be cognizant.
<p>
Despite the absence of contradiction in the statement that the  essence  and
the form of essence are the same and different, knowledge  of  the  form  of
essence will not lead to the knowledge of the nature of the essence  itself.
While one is knowable by its form the essence is known only by  realization.
Yet even though there is difference in the means of knowing the essence  and
the form of the essence this by itself  does  not  constitute  any  demerit.
Thus something which knowable by one method can also be unknowable by  other
methods. Still this does  not  result  in  the  possibility  of  any  defect
regarding knowledge acquired.
<p>
One <i>avatar</i> is not distinct from another  because  of  their  differences  in
form or the differences in their special  attributes  and  <i>lil?s</i>  or  divine
pastimes and one who does not experience separation from  the  Supreme  Lord
does not feel any difference from Them. Thus it is apparent that  there  can
never be any difference between the essence and the  form  of  essence.  The
form is completely spiritual  and  totally  transcendental  and  so  is  the
essence and there never can be any separation  between  the  two.  Similarly
even in the performance of actions the essence of strength and wisdom  never
come to be experienced as  separate  from  the  essence  itself.  Such  non-
distinction however is seen  as  separate  and  distinct  only  when  it  is
perceived in the material conception of gross physical bodies and when  such
separateness is experienced in the essence as being different it is  due  to
a figment of the imagination and attachment to material  nature  all  caused
by susceptibility to illusion.
<p>
In non-sentient objects there is  neither  distinction  or  non-distinction.
The experience of distinction and non-distinction does not manifest even  if
one conceptualizes because  in  non-sentient  objects  there  is  separation
between the essence and the form. In the case of  sentient  beings  however,
even though there is an awareness  of  being  non-distinct  there  arises  a
multitude of experiences of distinction between themselves and the forms  of
essence. The yarn in the cloth appears as  non-distinct  in  the  cloth  but
each  thread  comprising  it  is  different  from  each  other.   From   the
distinction in the thread the non-distinction in the cloth comes about.
<p>
So even though the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul  has  unlimited  distinct  forms  of
essence they are not comparable with the yarn because the separate  identity
of each thread will continue to remain distinctive. The  <i>atma</i>  is  pure  and
due to inner realizations of the soul every soul can be identified as  being
distinct and separate as well as  having  common  identity  with  all  other
souls. In the case of the yarn each thread although  distinct  and  separate
can never experience the common oneness with the  cloth.  Nothing  can  ever
exist without any parts in its possession. Even atoms  have  a  prior  state
and a later state but by this one cannot conclude that the atom is  made  of
parts. Atoms which possess protons, neutrons and electrons give credence  to
the sublime interrelation of  all  existence  although  in  their  separated
states of protons, neutrons and electrons a change in the  attributes  would
occur and a change in the entirety would be predicated. If such  changes  in
the relationship of atoms are possible then it is  impossible  to  deny  the
existence of difference in material objects which are comprised in  totality
by atoms.
<p>
In sentient beings the qualities and attributes  of  the  <i>atma</i>  exist  in  a
latent form, pregnant with potential, powerful and  all  knowing.  Therefore
between sentient beings and the eternal essence there  exists  an  extremely
subtle connection perpetually even from  one  life  to  the  next.  In  non-
sentient  objects  there  exists  nothing  but  the  energy  of  the   atoms
comprising the form  which  are  mere  parts  of  <i>prakiti</i>  or  the  material
substratum pervading physical existence. For the non-sentient  nothing  else
exists. Death denies eternity to  those  who  perceive  otherwise.  As  rain
water falling on the top of the  mountaintop  descends  downwards.  One  who
thinks that the <i>nama</i> or name, <i>rupa</i> or  form,  <i>guna</i>  or  attibutes,  <i>lila</i>  or
divine pastimes and <i>dhama</i> or holy abode of the Supreme Lord Krishna  or  any
of His authorised incarnations and expansions to be  distinct  and  separate
from Him in any way will also fall down from the higher levels of  exitence.
The Brahma Tarka states: That all the Vedic scriptures accordingly  make  it
evidently clear and also the sacred discourse  of  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  by
the resplendent Supreme Lord  Krishna  also  definitively  affims  that  all
activities and manifestations originate and terminate in Him  alone  by  His
<i>vibhuti</i> or divine transcendental opulence and magnanimous and  compassionate
nature.
