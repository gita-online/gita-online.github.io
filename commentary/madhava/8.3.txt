Hari Om! The renunciation of action and the  focused  concentration  of  the
mind at the time  of  death  is  discussed  in  this  chapter.  The  supreme
absolute  and  immutable  truth  is  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence and without changing its   <i>svabhavah</i> or  the  nature
which causes development and evolution which also manifests as the  <i>atma</i>  or
soul. Thus to remove any doubts about the paramount importance of the  Vedic
scriptures it is sometimes referred to as <i>adhyatman</i> or that  which  elevates
the <i>atma</i> or soul, also that by which the <i>atma</i>  is  revealed.  Similarly  the
<i>jivas</i> or embodied beings are also potentially <i>svabhavah</i> by  helping  oneself
to elevate themselves. Therefore the <i>jiva</i> that  which  is  made  up  of  its
innate nature. Since the attitude of  the  <i>jiva</i>  is  always  to  evolve  the
innate nature it is very beneficial. Associated  with  internal  organs  the
word <i>bhavah</i> indicating gross  material  elements  is  used;  but  since  the
internal organs do not all respond similarly  in  the  same  manner  another
interpretation of <i>bhava</i> could be not connected to  gross  material  elements
and that would fits with the word <i>svabhavo</i> which  refers  to  the  eternally
pure <i>atma</i> or soul and connotes our eternal  relationship  with  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna. The potency of the Supreme Lord which manifests  the  creation
of gross material elements and the living entities to be elevated  is  known
as <i>visargah</i> and is the special creative activity of the Supreme Lord.
