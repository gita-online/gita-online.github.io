The compound word <i>dirgha-sutri</i> means  procrastinating  but  it  also  infers
<i>dirgha-suchi</i> given to calumny of pointing out the past  defects  of  others.
The Amarakosa also states that one who exposes the mistakes of  others  from
the past is called <i>dirgha-sutri.</i>
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
According  to  the  Shabda  Tattva,  one  who  follows  the  procedures  for
prescribed Vedic activities but due to not being consequent,  procrastinates
and does not   commence it at the proper time is known as <i>dirgha-sutri.</i>  
<p>
The activity that is required to be performed at an auspicious time but  is
delayed and hence missed the mark also  indicates  the  meaning  of  <i>dirgha-</i>
<i>sutri</i> which includes indolence and  incompetence.  Although  procrastination
is accurate it also includes indolence, for  even  if  one  is  inspired  to
perform prescribed Vedic activities there is some impediment  and  obstacles
in accomplishing them. This is the result of obscuration of vision and  lack
of cognizance of the Supreme Lord Krishna's paramount position. So even  one
with the potential for great achievements, due to bewilderment,  despondency
and laziness fails to reap  the  benefits  for  not  performing  the  proper
activity at the proper time. Such a one is undeniably situated in <i>tama  guna</i>
the mode of ignorance.
