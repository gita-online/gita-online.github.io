Lord Krishna is revealing that it is not  possible  for  anything  to  exist
without Him. The Moksa  Dharma  text  reveals  that  the  Supreme  Lord  who
exhibited His universal form is of endless forms, of endless expansions,  of
endless manifestations, of endless incarnations and is  verily  the  endless
one.
