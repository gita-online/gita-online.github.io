The time parameters  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  performance  of  prescribed  Vedic
activities is explained by Lord Krishna in this verse. For  the  person  who
seeks fulfilment in the performance of actions, the means to  fulfilment  is
prescribed Vedic activities itself which gives bliss and leads to the  final
destination of <i>moksa</i> or liberation. It is seen  that  even  those  attaining
<i>moksa</i> possess equanimity of mind  as  the  resultant  fruit.  Equanimity  is
eliminating all things from the mind that are not related to  Lord  Krishna.
Even while experiencing the <i>prarabdha karmas</i> or the consequential  reactions
from actions, the all comprehensive and conscious presence of equanimity  is
seen to manifest in some and weathering out the impact one remains fixed  on
activities pertaining to the Supreme Lord.  It  has  therefore  been  stated
that only those who have  perceived  the  perception  of  the  Supreme  Lord
experience supreme bliss and will  their  minds  fixed  in  equanimity.  But
until the elimination of the <i>prarabdha</i> <i>karmas</i> has  come  those  of  superior
spiritual intelligence will immerse themselves in <i>sravanam</i>  or  hearing  and
<i>kirtanam</i>  or  reciting  the  glories   of   the   Supreme   Lord   Krishna's
transcendental qualities and pastimes.

Now begins the summation.

The comprehensive path for  attaining  <i>moksa</i>  is  equanimity  of  mind.  The
compound  word  <i>yoga-arudhasya</i>  are  those   whose   continuous   meditation
bequeaths equanimity. Those of equanimity in mind meditate  on  the  Supreme
Lord  Krishna  or  His  authorised  incarnations  as  given  in  the   Vedic
scriptures while performing all activities. Even from them prescribed  Vedic
activities  must  be  performed  with  a  totality  of  being  according  to
individual ability. One's  individual  potency  determines  the  ability  to
complete an activity or not. Those who are able  to  complete  the  activity
are called qualified. Those who strive to  complete  the  activity  but  are
unable to complete it are called aspirants. One who  is  benevolent  to  all
beings makes the Supreme  Lord  pleased  and  merciful  to  that  one.  Such
qualified beings place the Supreme Lord Krishna or His Vedically  authorised
incarnations  firmly  in  the  center   of   their   lives   through   there
consciousness, meditation, words,  deeds  and  every  action.  There  is  no
contrary activity to this for  them.  By  the  performance  of  such  action
exclusively  the  Supreme  Lord  is  elated  with  that  person.   Serenity,
equanimity of mind,  self  control,  austerity,  restraint  of  the  senses,
rejection of the  rewards  of  action  and  renunciation  are  required  for
aspirants while performing prescribed Vedic  activities  in  their  striving
for <i>moksa.</i>  But it is also seen that the qualified perform prescribed  Vedic
activities in devotion to the Supreme Lord even after  attaining  <i>moksa.</i>  So
following in their wake it is clear that no one is  exempt  from  performing
prescribed Vedic activities  according  to  qualification  before  attaining
<i>moksa</i> or after attaining it.
