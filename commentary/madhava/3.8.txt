One  should  perform  the  actions  that  are  appropriate  to  one's  <i>varna</i>
or status and <i>ashram</i> or stage in life.  In  Vedic  culture  there  are  four
<i>varnas:  brahmin</i> the priestly  class<i>,  kshatriya</i>  the  royalty  and  warrior
class<i>, vaishya</i> the farmers and businesss classes and <i>sudra</i> the  workers  and
servants of the previous three classes<i>.</i> In  Vedic  culture  there  are  also
four <i>ashrams: bramacharya</i> which is celibate student life, <i>grihasta</i> which  is
married family life, <i>vanaprastha</i> which is semi-retired householder life  and
<i>sannyasa</i> which is complete renunciation of worldy  life  for  meditation  on
God. Due to changing times and the  unseemly  mixture  of  different  varnas
people no longer adhere exclusively to the natural duties  of  their  <i>ashram</i>
as prescribed by the Vedas. This was even happening over 5000 years  ago  at
the end Dvarpara yuga. In the Mahabharata we  see  King  Yudhisthira  noting
that it was becoming exceedingly difficult to determine the <i>varna</i> of  people
due to the mixture of different classes. Therefore it  is  only  by  conduct
and attributes that one can judge what class one belongs to and  not  simply
by what <i>varna</i> one was born into and this conduct is determined  by  actions.
Unless and until the impulse arises for one to surrender themselves in  full
service and devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna then both <i>varna</i> and  <i>ashram</i>
apply in society. But  after  surrendering  in  devotion  <i>varnashram</i>  is  no
longer applicable or required.
