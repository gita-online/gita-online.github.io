The actions Lord Krishna is referring to in  this  verse  are  the  ordained
actions prescribed in the Vedic scriptures. By the  abstention  of  ordained
actions or by the renunciation of  ordained actions one  will  not  ever  be
able to achieve  moksa  or  liberation.  By  the  cultivation  of  spiritual
knowledge only is liberation possible. This is the purport. Why is this  so?
Because of the word purusah in the verse meaning person. The jiva or  living
entity is enclosed in a subtle body  along  with  a  corporal  body.  If  by
abstention of action moksa was  possible  then  it  would  be  available  to
inanimate things as well. Neither  by  the  abstention  of  actions  or  the
absence of reactions from the renunciation of actions will  liberation  come
into effect.

The effects we are experiencing in  the  present  life  are  reactions  both
positive and negative caused by our innumerable actions in  previous  lives.
It is not that all the reactions have been terminated at birth, Males up  to
the end of 14 years and females up to the end of  10  years  complete  their
life span of the effects  of  prior  activities  from  past  births.  Living
entities are capable of innumerable actions even in a  single  lifetime  and
each of these actions may be the cause of a future birth or even  result  in
many future lives. Contrarily by performing even a  single  action  one  can
receive a human life which is the culmination and conclusion  of  all  oneâs
remaining lives. Thus accumulation of actions can never end indefinitely.

The Brahma Purana states that: The primordial world is eternal  and  so  are
the effects of actions. Therefore how can  there  be  release  from  actions
without realisation of the Supreme Lord? If the primordial world came  about
by accident without any relation ship with casual  actions  then  how  could
there be any relationship between human beings  and  the  primordial  world?
The state of being liberated can only be achieved by one who  is  completely
free from all desires including the desire for liberation. All  desires  are
manifesting as appropriate and inappropriate actions. Factually  it  is  the
absence  of  desires  that  result  in  the  state  of  liberation.  Actions
performed  without  desire  for   rewards   with   spiritual   consciousness
contribute to the fulfilment of liberation. When fulfilment is achieved  one
attains  the  ultimate  consciousness  and   liberation   is   automatically
included. By performing actions  in  this  manner  a  living  being  becomes
verily a being of non-action. Renunciation is relinquishing the  desire  for
rewards attached to appropriate actions as Lord Krishna  explains  later  in
chapter XVIII verse two kamyanam karmanam nyasam meaning the  renouncing  of
fruitive activities. Performing actions in spiritual  consciousness  without
desire leads to liberation. For one who has become  effulgent,  purified  by
actions performed in spiritual consciousness, renunciation appears in  their
heart. Only one with a pure heart, free from desire and attachment is  known
as one situated in  spiritual  knowledge.  Just  as  one  seeing  delightful
things in a dream does not let that interfere for a moment the pleasures  of
daily life. For such a one there is no clarity in the principles  nor  faith
in the Vedic injunctions.

A counterpoint may be raised that if the absence of  desire  for  reward  is
the means for moksa then why  not  give  up  actions  altogether  giving  no
opportunity for the fruits to manifest. This opinion is neutralised  in  the
verse by na ca sannyasanad eva meaning  not  only  by  renunciation.  So  it
should be understood that not  by  mere  absence  of  desires  or  even  the
absence of actions that liberation can be achieved but  the  performance  of
actions  without  desire  for  reward  is  the   essential   ingredient   to
understand.

It should be understood that renunciation is primarily for  deep  meditation
and reflection of the resplendent Supreme Lord. This way  is   not  suitable
for those in the grihasta ashram or householder life with wife and  children
and who must be engrossed daily in so many material   functions  to  provide
for their family.  But in  later  life  when  the  children  are  grown  the
householder who by dint of actions has acquired a meditative mind  can  also
become eligible for renunciation and please the Lord. The  Supreme  Lord  is
exceedingly  pleased  by   those   who   practice   renunciation.   In   the
Narayanakshara Kalpa it is said that: Among all initiations the one that  is
made in the stage of renunciation is the topmost and most  pleasing  to  the
Supreme Lord. The demi-gods and many well known great  and  pious  kings  of
yore in India while performing myriadâs of actions for universal  management
and world order always kept their minds focused on  the  Supreme.  Therefore
even when they were engaged in activities their  minds  never  wavered  from
Him and the Supreme Lord Krishna was pleased.
