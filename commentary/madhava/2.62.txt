Lord Krishna has given the origin and causes for the  defects  mentioned  in
this verse and the previous one.  Sammoha  meaning  delusion  indicates  the
desire to engage in inappropriate actions. The same  meaning  is  given  for
moha which also  indicates  unrighteousness  desires  and  the  tendency  to
inappropriate activities. Bewilderment of memory causes destruction  in  the
intellect. Destruction  of  the  intellect  is  the  non-awareness  of  ones
eternal connection to the omnipresent soul.  Pranasyati  meaning  one  falls
completely down indicates that one goes to  the  degraded  hellish  planets.
Due to having unrighteous desires one cannot remember the eternal truths  of
the Vedic scriptures. Then due to defective perceptions one makes  erroneous
summations in what actions to perform and what actions not  to  perform.  By
these sinful activities one is degraded to the lower worlds.
<p>
Now begins the summation.

Sammoha denotes an illusionary perception of knowledge. This means  even  if
the knowledge is right one will be  deluded  and  remember  it  incorrectly.
Thus due to  perceiving  the  essence  of  the  knowledge  erroneously  ones
judgement will be compromised and  ones  actions  will  follow  a  distorted
summation.
