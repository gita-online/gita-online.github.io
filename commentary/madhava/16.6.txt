The material  existence  is  real.  This  world  is  not  an  illusion.  The
incarnation Vedavyasa has written  in  Vedanta  Sutra  III.II.III  beginning
<i>mayamatram tu kartsyena</i> meaning: This world  appears  illusory  because  its
nature is not manifest in its entirety.  The  Upanisads  proclaim  that  the
<i>brahman</i> or spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  has  a  twofold
nature of manifest and unmanifest and this is the established  form  of  the
ultimate truth. All the worlds have been established  by  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna who has energised them and sustains them providing  them  the  means
to flourish and evolve. The Supreme  Lord  as  <i>isvaram  parama</i>  the  supreme
controller who alone creates, maintains and destroys all existence  yet  the
demoniac contrarily, adamantly oppose Him.
