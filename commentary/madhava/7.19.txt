After the experience of many, many  lifetimes  one  becomes  aware  of  Lord
Krishna's supreme position. The Brahma Purana states: Becoming  aware  after
taking many, many births one resorts to the Supreme Lord.  It  is  not  that
everyone who first approaches the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  aware  of  His
paramount position as the  Supreme  controller.  It  is  subsequently  after
many, many lives of approaching Him that one becomes aware of this.
