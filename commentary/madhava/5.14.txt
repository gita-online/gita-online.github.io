The Supreme Lord being completely  transcendental  and  independent  to  the
material existence does not accept the pious merits or the  sinful  demerits
of any human being and although He energises all of their activities  He  is
never affected by them. This  is  because  human  beings  are  endowed  with
freewill and <i>viveka</i> or  a  sense  of  discrimination  and  this  unlike  the
animals gives them a limited independence regarding their  own  actions  and
the choice of their activities.  But  when  their  sense  of  discrimination
becomes shrouded by ignorance  in  the  absence  of  Vedic  knowledge  their
awareness  becomes   obscured   and   they   become   deluded   and   assume
responsibility or authorship for their  individual  actions  and  thus  they
assume also the reactions that accompany their actions binding them  tightly
to <i>samara</i> or the cycle of birth and death. If by chance an awareness  arises
in their consciousness that they are enveloped and shrouded in the  delusion
of illusion they do not consider  that  they  have  the  ability  to  change
anything because they do not realise that it is  Supreme Lord who  initiates
all actions. The resplendent Supreme Lord Krishna is like  the  sun  in  the
sky illuminates His light on the noble and the  vile,  the  sinful  and  the
pious impartially. And as  although  sunlight  touching  the  Earth  is  not
affected by events that happen in the world similarly the  Supreme  Lord  is
not affected by the events which transpire in the life of  human  beings  or
any other being.
