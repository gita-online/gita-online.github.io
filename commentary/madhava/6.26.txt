One should respect  all  living  entities  by  honouring  the  Supreme  Lord
residing within each and every being as confirmed by Lord  Krishna  in  this
verse. The  words  ekatvam  asthtitah  means  singularly  existing  and  the
Supreme Lord exists in all places as the One Lord. So it  should  always  be
acknowledged that In all respects and situations in the present and  in  the
future the individual should perform all activities for  the  Supreme  Lord.
Such spiritual intelligence always leads to spiritual enlightenment. If  one
by chance  omits  or  due  to  circumstances  fails  to  perform  obligatory
activities as prescribed in the Vedic scriptures one may have  to  suffer  a
reaction if it was important. This has  already  been  explained  previously
but for the sake of clarification it is stated that the steps of  those  who
worship and  adore  Lord  Krishna  will  never  deviate  from  the  path  of
righteousness. If unknowingly an offence  is  incurred  from  not  following
some injunction of the Vedic scriptures or an  ordinance  is  not  performed
correctly then by the strength of one's sadhana or spiritual  practices  all
reactions will be dissolved away. Historically many  ancient  kings,  rishis
and even demi-gods have committed great offences but due to the strength  of
their sadhana the reactions received were minimally experienced  until  they
dissolved.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
Everywhere the omnipresent Supreme Lord Krishna can be perceived to be
residing.
