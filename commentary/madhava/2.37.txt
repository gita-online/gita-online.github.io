If slain in battle while fighting bravely a ksatriya will  certainly  attain
the heavenly spheres. It is also stated in the Vedic scriptures  that  if  a
ksatriya is victorious in battle what will be  gained  is  dominion  of  the
Earth and at the end of the life the  heavenly  spheres  are  guaranteed  as
well. Thus those who fight bravely in  battle  and  are  undefeated  acquire
more merit than those who are defeated.
