The characteristics of <i>sannyasa</i> or renunciation of the  rewards  of  actions
is given here by Lord Krishna to emphasise the superiority  of  <i>sannyasa</i>  in
and of itself.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Characteristics of <i>sannyasa</i> are being described  here  such  as  being  free
from aversion and attraction and all dualities. Asceticism or  the  practice
of <i>tapasya</i> or austerities is not what is meant here. What is meant  here  is
the complete cessation of desire for  the  rewards  of  action  as  well  as
complete renunciation of the influence of all dualities  such  as  happiness
and  distress  which  causes  bondage  in  the  world.  So   there   is   no
contradiction in these two points.
