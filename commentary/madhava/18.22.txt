In chapter three, verse 30 Lord Krishna spoke of  surrendering  all  actions
with mind fixed on the Supreme Lord. This is because not performing  actions
according to duty, time  and  circumstance  will  cause  demerits  and  give
obstacles. Thus the performance of  prescribed  Vedic  activities  with  the
results surrendered unto the Supreme Lord due to  knowing  and  appreciating
His sublime magnificence as the creator of all is known as regulated  duties
in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
The statement in verse  thirty  of  fixating  the  consciousness  should  be
understood in meditating on the principle form of the Supreme  Lord  one  is
attracted to. The act of surrendering all actions to  the  Supreme  Lord  is
such that consciousness is fixed blissfully without cessation. Such  actions
of communion with  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His  authorised
incarnations as revealed in Vedic scriptures is known by the enlightened  as
situated fully in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
