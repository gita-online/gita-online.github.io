Lord Krishna speaks the words <i>mam atma-para-dehesu pradvisanto</i>  meaning  the
demoniac despise the Supreme Lord abiding within the eteric heart  of  their
own bodies as well as the bodies of others as <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme  Soul.
The evil  and  abominable  actions  executed  by  the  free  will  of  those
possessing a demoniac nature is never directed, motivated or  influenced  by
the  Supreme  Lord.  According  to  the  absolute  authority  of  the  Vedic
scriptures, the Sama Veda states it would be the  height  of  ignorance  and
foolishness to consider all actions to be under the auspices of the  Supreme
Lord when He has expressly bequeathed freewill to humans  and  other  higher
developed beings to give then the choice to surrender to Him with  devotion.
The Supreme Lord would never decree it any  other  way  to  force  a  living
entity to be devoted to Him. Every action that one commits certainly  has  a
returning reaction of retribution; but the recipient  of  that  reaction  is
only the one who physically or in special cases  mentally causes a  physical
effect to manifest.
