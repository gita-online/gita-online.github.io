The word <i>karyam</i> meaning effect verily signifies the physical body. The  word
<i>karana</i> meaning cause reinforces the reality that the physical  body  is  the
instrument of performing actions. The  word  <i>bhoktrtve</i>  means  experiencing.
Lord Krishna as the <i>purusa</i> a manifestation of the Supreme Lord as  unlimited
consciousness is the cause witnessing and experiencing through all <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings. <i>Prakriti</i> or  the  material  substratum  pervading  material
existence is the effect of actions and the  <i>purusa</i>  being  superior  is  the
cause of action.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
It is <i>prakriti</i> in the form of <i>maya</i> or  the  external  illusory  energy  that
bewilders <i>jivas</i> into believing the physical body  belongs  to  them  and  is
acquired on ones own independently; due to  being  completely  oblivious  of
the reality of Lord Krishna as the sole creator of everything in  all  times
throughout all creation and it is He alone  who  awards  the  power  of  the
<i>jivas</i> to experience the <i>ksetra</i> or field  of  activity  within  the  physical
body and within material existence. Lord Krishna is  known  as  the  Supreme
Controller because everything in exsitence emanates originally from  Him  in
the material worlds and Vaikuntha the  spiritual  worlds.  Even  though  the
Supreme Lord creates everything, to show that the  privilege  of  experience
has been granted to <i>prakriti</i> to a small degree, He uses the word  <i>ucyate</i>  or
speaks in two  places.  The  puport  is  to  emphasize  the  <i>purusa</i>  is  the
principle cause and <i>prakriti</i> is the secondary effect. Specifically  <i>prakriti</i>
is more an instrument of action then experiencing actions.  The  <i>jiva</i>  to  a
lesser extent has been granted agency for experiencing  and  enjoyment   but
the  actual  experiencer  and  enjoyer  is  the  Supreme  Lord  who  is  the
controller of everything and who is known as the <i>purusa</i> and ordains  through
the medium of His localized aspect of <i>paramatma</i> the supreme soul present  in
the etheric heart of all living entities.
