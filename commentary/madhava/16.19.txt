Hari Om! The distinctive differences  between  the  divine  nature  and  the
demoniac nature have been delineated in  detail.  Those  deluded  fools  who
imagine themselves  as  exercising  the  power  of  the  Supreme  Lord;  who
foolishly   consider   that   creation   manifested   without   a    supreme
consciousness,  who  deviously  speculate  and  hypothecate  that   creation
manifested on its  own  and  so  there  is  no  Supreme  Lord,  who  despite
knowledge  of  the  actual  reality  of  the  Supreme  Lord's   omnipotence,
omniscience and omnipresence; still spitefully oppose Him  and  vindictively
seek to undermine and destroy His creation.  All  these  degraded  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings, verily are born of the demoniac  nature  and  will  descend
into hellish existences in worlds of darkness.  These  unrepentant  demoniac
<i>jivas</i> in wharever form they appear in<i>,</i> thinking of  themselves  as  superior
never surrender to the Supreme Lord or offer reverence to Him. Instead  they
blaspheme the Supreme Lord, ridicule His absolute instructions in  the  form
of the Vedic scriptures and deride His devotees. Those  who  propagate  that
the Supreme Lord does not exist and is just an illusion are of the  demoniac
nature. Those who  challenge the divine instructions  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna, those who contradict the eternal truths  of  the  Vedic  scriptures
and those who dispute the eternal knowledge taught by the devotees  of  Lord
Krishna are all also irrefutably possessed of the demoniac nature.
<p>
The birth of a <i>jiva</i> as a demigod, a demon or a human  being  is  due  to  an
inherent resonance towards beings such based  upon  previous  activities  in
past lives. Because by possessing the attributes of any of them there  is  a
natural affinity leading back towards them from from whence  they  came  and
hence there never can be any artificial change in disposition.  Although  it
is possible for one to be born in the family of a demoniac  line  due  to  a
curse like Prince Prahlad  taking  birth  as  the  son  of  the  demon  king
Hiranyakasipu; but this is not true demoniac nature manifesting and  Prahlad
heard the glories of the Supreme Lord from Narada Muni while in his  mothers
womb and right from early childhood  exhibited  his  divine  nature  to  the
great chagrin and  disappointment  of  his  father.  Like  a  crystal  which
appears dark when seen in the  darkness  those  of  the  divine  nature  may
appear to be demoniac because of circumstances. But  it  is  only  temporary
and not even permanently present in a single life  because  such  situations
cannot alter the inherent divine attributes.
<p>
Therefore those of the divine nature quickly revive it within that  selfsame
life                                 even                                 if

born  in  inauspicious  situations.  Thus  wherever  and  under  whatever
conditions  those of the divine nature  take  birth  there  inherent  divine
attributes quickly fructify and activate them  to  quickly  become  eligible
for association with a Vaisnava spiritual master  who  bestows  devotion  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna and become qualified for communion with  Him.  That
eligibility comes  quickly  is  evidenced  that  Prahlad's  inherent  divine
attributes were so potent that He did not even have to  wait  until  he  was
born but received instructions while in the womb. There  are  many  blissful
levels of communion with the Supreme Lord that those of  the  divine  nature
may partake of as there are various gradations within  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
from material existence. Thus devotees  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  are
incapable of not being grateful and joyous.
