Thus after illustrating the fears  displayed  by  the  Kauravas  before  the
battle, the enthusiasm of the  Pandavas  was  expressed  by  the  word  <i>atha</i>
meaning therafter<i>.</i> When the Kauravas for the second time attempted to  rally
their army  for  battle  after  their  determination  got  dampened  by  the
Pandavas tumultous blowing  of  conch  shells;  then  the  Hanuman  bannered
Arjuna raised his mighty divine bow named Gandiva. By using the words  <i>kapi-</i>
<i>dhvajah</i> meaning the banner of  Hanuman  the  signifigance  is  that  Hanuman
fearlessly performed many extraordinarily difficult tasks for  Rama,  so  by
that great devotee hero being on the flag at  the  top  of  Arjunas  chariot
indicates  that  by  his  grace  Arjuna  will   be   blest   with   intrepid
fearlessness. By the use of the word <i>Hrsikesa</i> referring to Lord  Krishna  as
the controller of everyone's  senses  and  when  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
Himself is carrying out the orders of the Pandavas then  there  is  not  the
slightest doubt about the victory of  the  Pandavas  who  are  His  intimate
devotees.
