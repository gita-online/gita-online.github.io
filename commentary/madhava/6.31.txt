It should not be thought that the mind of its own accord becomes controlled
because that is not the case. For those who are unrighteous, who do not
desire what is good for other created beings, who hate, who are debauchers,
who are non-believers of the Vedic scriptures and other such persons, the
opportunity for moksa or liberation from the endless cycle of birth and
death in the material existence never manifests. This has been
categorically confirmed in the Brahma Purana.
