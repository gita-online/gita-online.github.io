Lord Krishna is stating that He alone is the Supreme Being  and  that  there
is none other.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
<i>Mattah parataram nanyat</i> means there is nothing is superior to Lord  Krishna.
To consider that there is anything, anywhere in creation independent of  Him
is  foolishness.  Because  of  contact  with  <i>prakriti</i>  or  material  nature
attachment and sorrow arise which enacts a distinct identity for all  living
entities. <i>Sri</i> or <i>Laksmi Devi</i> is superior to <i>prakriti,</i> being ever  free  from
sorrow. Although <i>Sri</i> associates with <i>prakriti</i>  there is no effect  from  it.
<i>Vayu</i> is the demigod in charge of wind. He is <i>madhyana</i>  or  intermediate  and
has some independence from <i>prakriti.</i> Lord  Krishna  is  known  as  the  most
exalted and since there are no more demigods superior  to  Him,  He  is  not
only exalted but the Supreme Being of all.
<p>
Because the <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  being  identifies  with  <i>prakriti</i>  attachment
arises and because of attachment then duality is accepted thereby  the  <i>jiva</i>
is considered to  be  in  an  inferior  position.  Therefore  everything  in
material existence which is temporary and subject to  change  is  considered
inferior without exception. Even more inferior are those  who  are  inimical
to the Supreme Lord. Having no cognisance with even their own  consciousness
they are ever associated with sorrow and despair. Thus  it  can  be  clearly
understood that only those who have a relationship  with  the  Supreme  Lord
have qualified themselves for salvation and no others.  Those  who  have  so
qualified  themselves  are  always  blissful  and   experiencing   happiness
internally are the superior ones. But even they are still below  Brahma  and
others according to <i>taratamya</i> or gradation of  qualification  in  <i>bhakti</i>  or
loving  devotional  service  to  the  Supreme  Lord.  Those   who   have   a
relationship with the Supreme Lord attain <i>moksa</i> or liberarion from  material
existence  by  this  very  experience.  By  such  experience   supra-sensory
illumination manifests in them known as <i>vijnana.</i> The depth  and  quality  of
the  perception  of  this  illumination  and  its  awareness  depends   upon
<i>taratamya</i> as well. The primary source of illumination is  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna and all others such as Brahma and Shiva are directly  empowered  and
illumined by Him.
