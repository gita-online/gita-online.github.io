In a very rational way Lord Krishna is praising the  saintly  performers  of
<i>yagna</i> by means of worship and offerings and  censoring  those  who  fail  to
perform such <i>yagna.</i> In the previous three verses and this one  Lord  Krishna
has elucidated the science of <i>yagna.</i> The Purusha Sukta in the  Rig  Veda  we
see that Brahma the first born is the Purusha offering  himself  as  worship
and  oblations  for  the  benefit  and  welfare  of  creation.   By   Brahma
inaugurating the act of <i>yagna,</i> the  perennial  principles  of  existence  or
<i>dharma</i> were established for all the worlds. Thus  by  ordaining  <i>dharma</i>  the
Supreme Lord Krishna through his representative  Brahma  has  given  mankind
the purpose, the objective and the  methodology  of  <i>yagna.</i>  One  in  wisdom
should follow in the footsteps of  Brahma and  offer  to  the  Supreme  Lord
there very self and essence as an act of worship in <i>yagna.</i>
