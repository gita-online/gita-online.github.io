The result of <i>raja guna</i> or the mode of passion does  not categorically  mean
only pain but denotes pleasure mixed with the pain. Actions are known to  be
in <i>rajas.</i> The Shabda Nirnaya states: In the word  <i>duhkha,  the  dhu</i>  denotes
pain and the <i>kha</i> denotes pleasure.. The Sharakarakshya text   states:  <i>Rajas</i>
verily manifests in small  measures  of  pain  and  pleasure  .  Along  with
pleasure must also come pain; therfore such persons are known as both  happy
and unhappy. Unhappy due to the pain from the effort and happy  due  to  the
pleasure of enjoying the result. Otherwise without such  joy  the  excessive
pain caused by <i>rajas</i> would be the same as the pain  caused  by  <i>tamas</i>  which
has an extremely limited scope for fulfilling  desires.  The  Skanda  Purana
states that <i>tamas</i> or darkness is caused by ignorance and always  results  in
continuous pain.
