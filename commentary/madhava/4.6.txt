One may wonder that if the Supreme Lord  Krishna  is  eternal  then  is  His
<i>svarupa</i> or transcendental  body  eternal  as  well?  To  this  Lord  Krishna
replies that He is unborn. In this verse the words  <i>avyaya  atma</i>  means  the
eternal body of the Supreme Lord. This also allows for the  reality  of  His
many incarnations such as Rama and Buddha. Just as  it  has  been  explained
previously  that  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul  being  purely  spiritual  is  without
beginning and eternal, in the same way the <i>svarupa</i> of  Lord  Krishna  should
be understood to exist. One may further wonder how is it He  appears  to  be
born if He is without a beginning and eternal? The answer  is  He  manifests
Himself by His Self as pure <i>sattva</i>  or  goodness  by  His  internal  potency
known as <i>yogamaya</i> through <i>prakriti</i> or material nature  which  is  completely
under His control. One may also wonder how it is He being  eternal  is  able
to manifest Himself through a material father and mother  such  as  Vasudeva
and Devaki? But as both Vasudeva and Devaki are also part of <i>prakriti,</i>  Lord
Krishna establishes them in pure <i>sattva</i> as well by His <i>yogamaya</i> potency  and
manifests Himself  through  them  appearing  to  be  born  by  normal  human
perception. It should not be thought that Lord  Krishna  is  dependent  upon
anything or that He is ever born or that He  ever  dies  nor  should  it  be
assumed that He uses the material elements of <i>prakriti</i> to create a form  for
Himself. His form is transcendental and completely in itself  and   <i>prakriti</i>
which is the substratum of all material existence  is  subservient  to  Him.
The Supreme Lord Krishna manifests His appearances  and  disappearances  and
the conditions necessary to descend and ascend by His own sweet  will.  <i>Atma</i>
<i>mayaya</i> infers the consciousness of  the  soul.  Since  for  material  nature
there is  the  distinct  word  <i>prakriti,</i>  here  <i>maya</i>  is  understood  to  be
referring to <i>yogamaya</i>  or  the  consciousness  of  Lord  Krishna's  internal
potency. This means  that  <i>yogamaya</i>  arranges  the  situation  and  all  the
details with phenomenal alacrity and intricacy so that Lord Krishna  appears
to be born like a normal human being but factually this not so.  He  appears
to be born from a mother and a father but actually it is not the case.  <i>Isha</i>
means great but <i>Ishvara</i> means greater than <i>isha.</i>Therefore it is stated  that
since Lord Krishna is superior to those who are <i>isha</i> such as  Brahma,  Shiva
and Shesha, only He is to be known as <i>Ishvara</i> or the greatest of  the  great
and none other.
