This verse  conveys  the  relative  ease  by  which  <i>sannyasis</i>  or  celibate
brahmins exclusively devoted to the Supreme Lord  Krishna  can  achieve  the
unparalleled bliss of  <i>atma tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation  as  well  as  the
<i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all existence.
