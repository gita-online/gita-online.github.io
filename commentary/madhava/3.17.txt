The word <i>indriyani-ramo</i> in the previous verse indicates one  who  constantly
seeks to revel in the garden of senses objects. It is not possible for  such
a person to achieve <i>atma-tattva</i> or soul realisation. In  this  verse  <i>trupti</i>
means satisfied by how things  come  on  their  own  accord,  and  the  word
<i>santustah</i> means completely content. The  delight  which  arises  from  being
satisfied is complete contentment. In any other thing sufficient delight  is
derived but the Supreme  delight  is  only  found  in  connection  with  the
Supreme Lord. One who has attained <i>atma-tattva</i> is  no  longer  delighted  by
external affairs, such a person is self satisfied internally  for  only  the
one who finds self realisation within is contented.  Nothing  else  will  be
the cause of joy for them and their satisfaction and  contentment  is  based
solely on their realisation of their eternal soul within and the glories  of
the Supreme Lord.
<p>
Thus for one who has attained <i>atma-tattva</i> the performance of the  prescribed
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures is not necessary or required.   For  one
who is self realised is also self satisfied and  there  is  no  action  that
needs to be performed as a self realised being  is  completely  transcendent
to the dualities and all ego consciousness. But for one who  is  established
in awareness  of  bodily  consciousness  it  is  mandatory  that  prescribed
actions from the Vedic scriptures are duly performed. Such ordained  actions
are actually for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord and naturally what  is
to be expected in all circumstances. are purifying and very  blissful.  This
has been explained in the Pancaratra.
<p>
Factually in all situations relating to the  Supreme  Lord  eternal  delight
and rapture occurs. In  all  other  cases  where  there  is  sufficiency  of
satisfaction alone there is no suggestion of eternal delight. Having  spoken
seperately a<i>tmany eva ca santustah</i> meaning completely  satisfied  solely  in
the soul Lord Krishna emphasises the paramount  importance  of  <i>atma-tattva.</i>
Also it can be seen that performance of actions dictates  there  must  be  a
concept of time such as when did it take place and how long did  the  action
take etc. Thus only  one  who  is  aware  of  bodily  consciousness  is  the
necessity of performing prescribed actions needed.
<p>
In this world  only  human  beings  have  the  potential  to  achieve  <i>atma-</i>
<i>tattva.</i>  Thus  only  mankind  can  attain  this  consciousness  and   become
spiritually liberated. The word <i>manava</i> means  mankind  from  the  root  word
<i>manu.</i> Self satisfied means only satisfied in the Supreme  Self.  Thus  being
satisfied in <i>atma-tattva</i> or soul  realisation  one  is  also  simultaneously
satisfied in the Supreme Self residing within every living entity. Thus  the
statement one who completely delights in the Supreme Lord  for  that  person
there is no necessity for performing the prescribed  actions  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. They have already achieved the goal of human existence.
<p>
Thus begins the summation.
<p>
Words used like  satisfaction  and  contentment  are  used  as  synonyms  to
emphasise satisfaction and contentment in the Supreme Self within.  One  who
receives the grace of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  completely  satisfied
because of the grace of Lord Krishna and one who being completely  satisfied
by the grace of Lord Krishna is known to have attained <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
from the cycle of birth and death in the material existence. This  has  been
given in the Agni Purana.
<p>
The word <i>rati</i> means delight and the word <i>ananda</i> means bliss. They  are  used
to illustrate satisfaction and contentment respectively in  the  performance
of  prescribed  Vedic  activities.  <i>Priti</i>  or  love  is  two-fold,  love  in
friendship while performing actions or love in  servitude  while  performing
actions. This is given in the Shabda Nirnaya.
The  word  <i>santosha</i>  meaning  satisfaction  and  the  word  <i>trupti</i>   meaning
contentment   are   used   alternatively   as   <i>apoorti</i>    or    emphasising
incompleteness.
