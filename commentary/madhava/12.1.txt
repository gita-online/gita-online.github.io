Hari OM! This  chapter  confirms  that  propitiation  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna is superior to the unmanifest, impersonal and  imperishable  <i>brahman</i>
or the spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence.  Here  Lord  Krishna
outlines the procedure of performing it. The procedure  itself  becomes  the
means for <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence.  All  who  propitiate
the  <i>brahman</i>  will  also  achieve  <i>moksa</i>  after  having  all  their  desires
fulfilled. In the Agni section of the  Sama  Veda  it  states:  Propitiating
that which  is  superior  to  the  eternal  and  beginningless  <i>brahman</i>  one
achieves <i>moksa</i> from <i>samsara</i> or the endless cycle of  birth  and  death.  The
words <i>aksaram avyaktam</i>  refer  to  the  indestructible,  unmanifest  supreme
absolute or <i>brahman</i> whose <i>s</i>teadfast worship  eventually  releases  one  from
all constraints. So great is the result  of  propitiation  in  reference  to
this as revealed in the Vedas. Those who  worship  the  goddess  Sri  Laksmi
with four arms and hands, ever  young,  ever  content,  resplendent  as  the
eternal consort of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual worlds being His  <i>sakti</i>
or spiritual feminine potency in  the  material  worlds,  endowed  with  the
wealth of wisdom; such a being is  blessed  by  the  two-fold  form  of  the
Supreme Lord which manifest themselves both externally as an experience  and
internally within one's heart.
<p>
This has been documented in other Vedic scriptures as well in  the  Puranas.
Having started with the declaration in Rig  Veda  X.CXXV  that:  Sri  Laksmi
wanders wherever the different <i>vibhuti</i> or  divine,  transcendental  opulence
of the Supreme Lord appear such as the Rudras, the Vasus, the  Adityas,  the
Visva-devas etc. She is the gatherer of treasures and the  empress  of  Lord
Krishna's direct expansion Narayana the Lord of all <i>Vaikuntha</i>,  the  eternal
spiritual worlds and being the personal <i>sakti</i> of the Supreme Lord  she  also
expands herself as the consort of each and every incarnation  and  expansion
of Lord Krishna and  thus  also  merits  worship.   Thus  the  demigods  and
elevated beings have established her worship in many  places  and  homes  to
abide in, on the left side of the Supreme Lord. Through her  alone  all  eat
the food that feeds them as well as sees, breathes and hears  the  sound  of
the word outspoken, although they know it not and are unaware. Hear now  one
and all the truth as she declared it:  The  one  who  she  benedicts  excels
above others and is most powerful  becoming a sage, yogi or brahmana. It  is
by her energy that the bow of Rudra is bent and his arrows are propelled  to
strike and slay those who disrespect, despise and  offend  the  devotees  of
the Supreme Lord. On the worlds summits she  designates  the  powerful.  Her
home is in the waters of the casual  ocean  far,  far  beyond  the  material
worlds and far beyond even the heavenly planets. Sri  Laksmi  the  universal
mother is majestic in her grandeur. One who pleases her is blest  to  become
a Brahmin, opulent and wise. Because the Vedic scriptures  state  like  this
there may be some doubt as to whether Sri Laksmi has the capacity to   grant
<i>moksa</i> or liberation by the power  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  To  discern  this
subtle truth and for the  sake  of  knowledge  Arjuna  uses  the  word  <i>evam</i>
meaning in which way.
<p>
Arjuna is requesting reassurance since  experiencing  the  reality  of  Lord
Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form, he was puzzled and  unsure  if
<i>avaktya</i>  or  the  unmanifest  being  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence should be meditated on  or  should  he  meditate  on
<i>prakriti</i> the material substratum underlying physical existence which is  the
source of the three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature  being  <i>tama</i>  or
ignorance, <i>raja guna</i> or mode of passion and <i>sattva guna</i> or mode of  goodness
The word <i>aksaram</i> means eternal, absolute and Sri Laksmi is also eternal  and
absolute and <i>prakriti</i> arises completely out of her but the Supreme  Lord  is
superior to all that. Then he is wondering should he not  worship  the  <i>atma</i>
or eternal soul within or should he just directly worship the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna with  loving  devotion?  The  indestructible  <i>brahman</i>  is  a  direct
reflection of the  Supreme  Lord  and  none  other  then  He.  Always  being
blissful He appears as Vasudeva and is all pervading. He is  also  <i>paramatma</i>
the Supreme Soul within the etheric heart of all sentient beings.  This  has
been given in chapter two.  His  form  and  qualities  have  been  given  in
chapter  three  and  meditation  has  subsequently  been  advised   as   the
consequent activity.
<p>
Knowledge of  the  prodigious  manifold  forms  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  His
manifold expansions, His manifold  incarnations,  His  <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine
universal form and the unlimited <i>lilas</i> or pastimes of them  all  begins  the
revelation that Lord Krishna is the immortal, eternal  Lord  of  all  lords,
from whom everything emanates in existence and  to  whom  all  paths  return
back to Him. In the Sama Veda, Saukarayana section we find  that  Rudra  the
mind born son of Brahma approaches him and asks to know who  is  verily  the
ultimate goal of all existence, the eternally established,  creator  of  all
beings who bestows <i>moksa</i> or liberation upon  the  aspirants,  the  righteous
and the noble. How does one meditate upon such a Supreme Being and  how  can
one meditate upon a Supreme Being who is completely  spiritual  without  any
material qualities or attributes? Brahma replied it is  verily  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna who is the ultimate goal as well as the  object  of  meditation
by the  aspirants  and  the  granter  of  <i>moksa.</i>  Of  unlimited  <i>avatars</i>  or
incarnations, expansions  and  manifestations,  appearing  in  many  colours
surrounded by a golden hue. He verily is shining like the sun and should  be
meditated upon within the heart as a  personality  resembling  a  human  the
colour of a radiant dark blue sapphire with gentle smile  and  hands  giving
blessing surrounded by a golden hue. He is camouflaged by  the  <i>brahman</i>  the
spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  and  which   emanates   an
impenetrable  dazzling  light  throughout  all  creation  which  effectively
covers His all pervading form. It  is  for  this  reason  that  He  is  also
propitiates as <i>avyaktam</i> or immutable and <i>aksaram</i> or  unmanifest  because  He
cannot be perceived by material vision.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Hari OM! Here is explained the means of achieving spiritual practice.
<p>
The immutable, unmanifest known as the <i>brahman</i> although without form by  the
will of the Supreme Lord  arises  from  His  <i>sakti</i>  or  spiritual,  feminine
potency known as Sri or Laksmi. For her propitiation an aspirant must  leave
home and for being initiated in <i>tattva</i>  or  knowledge  about  her  one  must
approach and accept a spiritual master in her  line.  Whomsoever  learns  to
propitiate her attains <i>moksa.</i> Thus the objective of both  the  aspirant  and
the guru are fulfilled. Those who propitiate Sri Laksmi, the consort of  the
Supreme Lord is His <i>sakti</i> which controls the material existence and is  also
known as Ambika, Agrya, Aupala, Hri and Sivdya are granted   <i>moksa,</i>  If  Sri
Laksm is pleased then the Supreme Lord becomes pleased  also and if  she  is
not pleased then the Supreme Lord remains unpleased as well.
<p>
The Brahmanda Prurana states: Sri Laksmi is known as <i>avyaktam</i> or  unmanifest
because <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum  underlying  physical  existence
arises from her. She is also known as  <i>aksaram</i>  or  immutable,  the  Supreme
consciousness, the primal source, the refuge for all and  the  abiding  one;
but the Supreme Lord who empowers her is verily superior  to  her.  So  such
propitiation to the <i>avaktam</i> is synonymous with propitiation  to  Sri  Laksmi
and the Supreme Lord. This has been asked by  Arjuna  for  clarification  of
which path is more meritorious for attaining <i>moksa.</i> That  which  is  abiding
within is known as  the  immutable  and  never  changing.  This  is  clearly
determined by such statements in the Vedic scriptures such  as:  That  which
who abides within, eternally, unlimited, all pervading,  etc.  These  things
clearly refer to  the  unmanifest  consciousness.  Otherwise  such  distinct
queries such as who is to be propitiated and the method of propitiating  Him
and between the two which is superior would not have been asked.  Those  who
consider  propitiation  to  the   abstract,   indistinct,   impersonal   and
imperishable <i>brahman</i> to be superior  to  direct  loving  devotion  unto  the
Supreme Lord are verily deluded and far  away  from  the  actual  <i>tattva</i>  or
conclusive truth.
