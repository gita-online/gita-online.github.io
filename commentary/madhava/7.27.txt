Embracing the delusion of the dualities such as pleasure  and  pain,  praise
and ridicule, joy and grief  along  with  desire  and  attachment  to  sense
objects it impossible to acquire  the  awareness  of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation which  is  the  essential  and  exclusive  prerequisite  to  God
consciousness. All these obstacles and  hindrances  were  mandated  as  Lord
Krishna reveals by the word <i>sarge</i> meaning at the very beginning of  creation
as soon which means for us as soon as our  <i>atma</i> or eternal  soul  became  an
embodied being. With the acceptance of a physical  body  dualities,  desires
and attachments arise and before the  acceptance  of  a  the  physical  body
there was no awareness of them.

The delusions of duality are illusionary and opposed  to  knowledge.  As  in
darkness everything appears similar so in the case  of  delusion  everything
is in illusion. The Mahabharata  has  discussed  this  point  in  detail  as
follows. There is duality between the Supreme Lord and  the  embodied  being
and this is real knowledge. All other dualities are illusory and  are  known
as <i>dvanda-moha</i> or a delusion of dualities. <i>Avidya</i> or  non-knowledge  is  its
effect and because its effect leads to even greater  delusions  there  is  a
resultant mixture of anger. The Agni Purana states that: The embodied  being
who assumes that they are the same as the Supreme Lord or that  the  Supreme
Lord is the same as the embodied  being  or  that  there  is  no  difference
between the Supreme Lord and the embodied being is one who is  beguiled  and
bewildered by <i>maya</i> or illusory impressions superimposed upon the mind.
