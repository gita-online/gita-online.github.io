In the normal course of events in the material existence although  there  is
no destruction there may appear that some being is  destroyed  like  in  the
case of  Daksa  losing  his  head  due  to  the  wrath  of  Siva.  To  avoid
misinterpretations in this way the Supreme Lord mentions the fact  that  the
soul can not be pierced in any way.

Now begins the summation.

As there is no means for the destruction of the Supreme Lord there  is  also
no means of destruction for the immortal soul.
