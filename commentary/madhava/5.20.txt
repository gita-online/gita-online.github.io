In this verse Lord Krishna again  clarifies  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness and how this relates to equanimity  of  actions.  Without  any
other desires internal or external only the person who relishes  and  revels
in the <i>atma</i> or eternal  soul  is  alone  eligible  for  realisation  of  the
<i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence  and  the  bliss
accompanying it. The communion of the <i>atma</i> is the same as the  communion  of
the <i>Brahman</i> for they both possess the same eternal nature and the  only  way
this communion can be attained is through mediation of  <i>yoga</i>  and  no  other
way.

Now begins the summary.

<p>
So it can be understood that if even by remembrance of the potencies of  the
Supreme Lord so much happiness can be gained then what can be said  for  one
who devotes themselves wholeheartedly to the Supreme Lord in a  concentrated
manner.
