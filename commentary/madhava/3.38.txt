The <i>atma</i> or soul is not perceivable by a human being. Why is this so? It  is
because the <i>atma</i>  is enveloped within and when the senses are  excited  <i>kama</i>
or lust manifests itself explosively completely covering the <i>atma</i>  and  that
is why <i>kama</i> is  such a formidable adversary.  <i>Kama</i>  so  thickly  covers  the
<i>atma</i> that it cannot be perceived and Lord Krishna gives  three  examples  to
emphasise this.
