By Arjuna addressing Lord Krishna  as  <i>Govinda</i>  expresses  that  since  <i>Lord</i>
<i>Krishna</i> is the knower of all the functions of the senses,  Lord  Krishna  is
also the knower of his mind. The reason for not desiring  the  kingdom  etc.
are given in the second half of verse 32 beginning:  <i>yesam  arthe.</i>  One  can
desire a kingdom for the happiness of ones kinsman even at the cost of  ones
own life; but in this battle when the destruction of ones kin is certain  it
is a fruitless desire to engage in battle. If it is put forth that  although
Arjuna out of compassion might not wish to  slay  his  enemies;  but  it  is
certain that his enemies will surely slay him to keep the kingdom free  from
thorns. To answer this Arjuna is saying even if they intend to slay  him  he
will not slay them. He says: I do not desire  the  rulership  of  the  three
worlds let alone this tract of land called  Earth.  If  it  is  argued  that
Arjuna could slay only the sons of Dhritarastra who caused the  Pandavas  so
much troubles and leave all the others warriors alive then  to  answer  this
Arjuna is saying: what pleasure is there for us the  Pandavas  to  kill  the
sons of  Dhritarastra?  In  expectation  of  temporary,  earthly  pleasures,
fratricide is not in any way an appropriate  action  and  will  only  insure
eternal damnation to hell. By Arjuna addressing Lord  Krishna  as  <i>Janardana</i>
which means He who always naturally protects His  devotees;  that  since  He
has appeared for removing the sins from this world, then He  can  just  slay
all these sinners Himself and since Lord Krishna is the Supreme  Lord  there
is no question of Him  incurring  any  sinful  reaction  for  causing  their
deaths.
