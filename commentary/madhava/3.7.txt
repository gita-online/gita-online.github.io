Lord  Krishna  previously  spoke  of  the  pretensions  of  the   pretenders
renouncing all actions with  great  effort  by  forcefully  subjugating  the
desires of the mind. Now to  show  the  predominant  role  of  the  mind  in
influencing our thoughts He uses the word <i>manasa</i> remembering in mind.  <i>Karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> the yoga of actions is suitable according to the stage  of  development
one  is  in.  One  should  not  think  that  <i>karma  yoga</i>  is  only  for  the
<i>grihastas</i> or householders because by the word <i>manasa</i> it  is  asserting  that
<i>karma yoga</i> can also be used by renunciates as well.
