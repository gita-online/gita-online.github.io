Hari OM! In  this  chapter  Lord  Krishna  clarifies  what  He  has  already
revealed in the seventh chapter. Sovereign  wisdom  is  primal  wisdom.  The
word <i>pratyaksavagaman</i> is that which is experienced by direct realization  of
the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all existence. That  which  is
established in each of the sense organs individually is known as  <i>pratyaksa.</i>
The Moksa Dharma  states:  That  which  is  established  in  the  breath  is
different from the primal breath  of  the  presiding  deity.  The  presiding
deity will not know him but he  is  like  the  body  of  the  Supreme  Lord.
Similarly are the presiding deity of  speech  and  the  presiding  deity  of
sight etc. The Supreme <i>Purusa</i> or supreme personality who is the  size  of  a
thumb is abiding  in  the  etheric  space  within  the  heart.  He  is  also
established in the mind, the moon, space, the  sun,  etc.  In  the  Vavravya
section of  the  Sama  Veda  is  stated:  Having  established  each  of  the
presiding deities as the perceiver of the sense  organs,  the  <i>Purusa</i>  being
the archetype of the senses is also known as <i>pratyaksa.</i> One who  understands
the <i>Purusa</i> as such is endowed with wisdom. The word <i>dharmyam</i>  means  eternal
righteousness and is representative of the Supreme Lord. All his  activities
are always established in eternal righteousness. Whatever  is  spoken  about
Him or written about Him from the Vedic scriptures concerning Him or any  of
authorized <i>avatar's</i> or incarnations and His and their activities are  always
without exception established in eternal  righteousness.  He  maintains  and
sustains the entire material creation therefore  He  is  the  foundation  of
<i>dharma.</i> Being the sole upholder of all <i>dharma</i> the Supreme  Lord  is  revered
as  the  apex  and  ultimate  personality.  Preserving  and  supporting  all
existence thereby all beings in creation are supported  as  well.  The  Sama
Veda reveals: In the beginning only the  Supreme  Lord  as  <i>dharma</i>  existed,
neither the Earth, the wind  or  space,  nor  Brahma,  nor  Shiva,  nor  the
demigods, nor the sages. The word <i>pratyaksavagaman</i> also denotes one  of  the
ways to experience supernatural reality.
