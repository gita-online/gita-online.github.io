Bhishma become elated hearing the praises given him by Duryodhana.  Thus  to
eliminate the fear he knew Duryodhana was concealing in his heart he  roared
like a lion,  <i>simha-nadam</i>  means  roaring  like  a  lion  and  then  blew  a
thunderous blast on his conchshell. By only sounding a blast  on  his  conch
shell without speaking Bhishma signified that true to  <i>ksatriya</i>  or  warrior
code of warfare he would fight until death.
