Hari  OM!  In  this  chapter  whatever  has  been  previously  stated  about
knowledge, the object of knowledge,  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum
pervading  physical  existence  and  the  <i>Purusa</i>  or  the  Supreme   eternal
consciousness is herein being categorically collated and elucidated by  Lord
Krishna. The means of developing spiritual  intelligence  through  <i>karma</i>  or
activities was given by Lord Krishna in the first six chapters known as  the
Karma Yoga section and the means of achieving  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving
devotion to Lord Krishna was revealed in the subsequent six  chapters  known
as the Bhakti Yoga section along with the different  manifestations  of  the
Supreme Lord have all been arranged here together in summation.
<p>
The <i>jiva</i> or embodied being is by itself  eternal  because  it  possesses  an
<i>atma</i> or eternal soul bestowed by the Lord Krishna which is an  infinitesimal
spark from Him; but the physical body  although  energized  by  the  Supreme
Lord is not eternal and disintegrates  with  time.  Therefore  the  physical
body is called <i>sharira</i> because it appears to die and since the Supreme  Lord
resides within all <i>jivas</i> as the  <i>atma</i>  He  is  known  as  <i>ksetrajna</i>  or  the
consciousness within the <i>ksetra</i> or field  of  activity.  This  consciousness
envelopes the physical body and is the source of the material  senses  which
display their perceptions of duality in the  <i>ksetra</i>  of  the  physical  body
with emotions of like  and  dislike,  happiness  and  misery,  pleasant  and
unpleasant, love and hate etc.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
One who is freed from the modulations of desires  and  the  bewilderment  of
attractions is able to unite with pure thoughts of spiritual  consciousness.
Such a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being  is  considered  to  have  achieved  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material  existence.  The  Narayana  Scripture  states  that
there are two manifestations of <i>moksa</i>. The superior form of <i>moksa</i>  is  known
as <i>suddha</i> or pure liberation and its consciousness is always attuned and  in
harmony with <i>dharma</i> or eternal righteousness and the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
or any of His authorized <i>avatars</i> or incarnations and expansions as  revealed
in Vedic scriptures. This consciousness has an all  comprehensive  knowledge
about the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul and following the injunctions and  ordinances
of the Vedic scriptures is always engaged in performing different levels  of
<i>bhakti</i> or devotion to the Supreme Lord which eventually  results  in  direct
communion with the Supreme Lord eternal association with Him.
<p>
The inferior form of <i>moksa</i> is known as <i>asuric</i>  or  demoniac  liberation  and
its consciousness is antagonistic to <i>dharma</i> or eternal righteousness, it  is
addicted to perverse pleasures of the physical  body,  it  has  a  distorted
conceptions of the <i>atma</i> and is  always  desiring  to  perform  degraded  and
prohibited activities. Its mentality is adverse to engaging in  any  service
of the Supreme Lord and eventually without fail end up in  the  most  fallen
of species in the lowest hellish realms due to  offenses  made  against  the
devotees of the Supreme Lord Krishna.
