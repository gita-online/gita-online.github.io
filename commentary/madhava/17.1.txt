Hari OM! In this chapter the Supreme Lord Krishna  explains  the  attributes
and results of the three  <i>gunas</i>  or  threefold  modes  of  material  nature:
<i>sattva guna</i> or the mode of goodness, <i>raja guna</i> or the mode  of  passion  and
<i>tama guna</i> or the mode of ignorance. The words <i>sastram-vidam</i>  refers  to  the
ordinances,  injunctions  and  prohibitions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures.  An
example of a prohibition is that the Vedic scriptures  declare  that  it  is
forbidden to marry a virgin maiden no matter how  qualified  if  her  mother
and father have a <i>sapinda</i> relationship with each  other,  meaning  that  the
two grandmothers of the virgin are sisters. Those who  disregard  this  rule
and marry such a maiden anyway  verily  commit  sin,  as  only  after  seven
generations of <i>sapinda</i> free marriages  are  the  sinful  reactions  of  such
incestuous  relationships  neutralized.  Possessing   this   knowledge   the
Vaisnavas  and  the  twice  born  Brahmins  act  accordingly  and   steadily
progressing  in  their  spiritual  development  advance  with  clarity   and
comprehension.
<p>
What is prescribed in the Vedic scriptures  is  <i>sanatan  dharma</i>  or  eternal
righteousness  and  anything   contrary   to   this   is   against   eternal
righteousness. Those in <i>sattva guna</i> always acknowledge the authority of  the
Vedic  scriptures  and  never  act  contrary  to  the   ancient,   perennial
principles of <i>sanatan dharma.</i> So the word <i>utsrjya</i> meaning rejected does  not
refer to them. It applies to  those  in  <i>raja  guna</i>  who  belligerently  and
insidiously oppose the Vedic scriptures and those in <i>tama guna</i>  who  out  of
lack of effort and intelligence ignore and  are  indifferent  to  the  Vedic
scriptures. Those who were never properly taught the knowledge of the  Vedic
scriptures or who were never exposed and are unaware  of  the  teachings  of
the Vedic scriptures or who were unqualified to learn the knowledge  of  the
Vedic scriptures due to circumstances is  what  is  indicated  here.  It  is
reasonable and plausible to assume that there  must  be  some  gradation  in
this rejection and this is the  purpose  of  Lord  Krishna  delineating  the
three fold positions of the <i>gunas.</i> So such denial  is  the  result  of  non-
awareness of the universal values enshrined within the Vedic scriptures  for
the ultimate benefit of all creation.
