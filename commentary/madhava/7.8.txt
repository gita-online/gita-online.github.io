Here we are receiving <i>jnana</i> or knowledge that Lord Krishna  is  the  essence
of specific things. Super sensory illuminating perception  is  <i>vijnana.</i>  The
greatness of the Supreme Lord is revealed later but now  even  the  inherent
nature of and His being the essence of along with the natural qualities  and
attributes of different substances are  being  described  as  being  special
potencies and representations of the  Supreme  Lord.  The  fact  that  these
special essences and attributes do not manifest on their  own  is  shown  by
the mentioning of special words such as <i>raso'ham  apsu</i>  meaning  He  is  the
essence in water. This essence is to be understood in the  case  of  <i>upasana</i>
or spiritual practices. It has been mentioned in the Gita  Kalpa  that:  The
attribute of essence  in  various  flavours  and  its  inherent  nature  are
basically  due  to  the   perennial   principle   of   <i>dharma</i>   or   eternal
righteousness. The provider and enjoyer of the essence is always solely  the
Supreme Lord Krishna, who as the essence resides  in  all  living  entities.
All the empowered demigods  are  mere  reflections  of  His  splendour.  The
Supreme Lord is the essence of all and should be earnestly sought  by  those
who seek the essence of life. The inherent energy of  <i>Prakriti</i>  or  material
nature and all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings is all ordained by the Supreme  Lord
and all natural propensities and inherent tendencies are bequeathed  by  His
grace alone. There is nothing whatsoever  animate  or  inanimate  throughout
all of creation that does not contain the Supreme Lords essence.

The Gita Kalpa has  stated  that:  Desires  not  contrary  to  righteousness
should be engaged in  by  an  aspirant  of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  the
material  existence.  For  the  purpose   of   elevating   one's   spiritual
development one should only perform activities which are  not  contradictory
to <i>dharma</i> but even  the  renunciation  of  such  authorised  activities  are
recommended to be relinquished for advanced aspirants. Strength without  the
debilitating influence of desires and attachments should be  achieved.  Then
by the grace of the  Supreme  Lord  perfection  will  be  attained  and  the
desired goal will be reached.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Residing in water as sapidity, the Supreme Lord is  known  as  the  essence.
Residing in the sun and the moon as luster, He  is  known  as  illumination.
Residing in the Vedas as His very self, He is known as the <i>pranava</i>  original
sound vibration <i>OM.</i> Residing in the ether as sound Lord Krishna is known  as
the word.
