In the previous verses Lord Krishna has  stated  that  the  senses  are  too
powerful to subdue by our own efforts. Yet effort should be made  repeatedly
regardless. Now here he suggests that we subdue our senses  by  devotion  to
Him. The word yuktah denotes devotion to Lord Krishna,  one  whose  mind  is
attuned to Him. Otherwise it is not possible to overcome the senses  in  any
way and maintain it. Mat-parah  means  one  devoted  to  Lord  Krishna.  The
benefits of one  surrendered,  attuned  and  devoted  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna will be well documented later.
