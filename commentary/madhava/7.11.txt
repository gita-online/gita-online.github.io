Being  completely  devoid  of  desires  and  attachments  Lord  Krishna   is
eternally full and powerful in strength. This is His natural propensity  and
contains no <i>rajas</i> or passion. Since He bestows strength similar to His  like
He did with the five Pandavas, He is <i>balam balavatam</i> or the strength of  the
strong. Since <i>ba</i> symbolises strength and <i>la</i>  symbolises  bliss,  He  is  the
bliss of strength Himself.

It is primarily the unchecked desires for  sensual  enjoyments  that  causes
the diminution of piety and morality; but these desires are not  detrimental
if they are attuned to <i>sanatan dharma</i> or eternal righteousness. The  Supreme
Lord resides in all desires that are not contrary to <i>sanatan dharma</i>; but  he
never resides in any action that is  contrary  to  righteousness.  Therefore
the Supreme Lord Krishna even while abiding  in  everything  still  has  the
capacity to remain distinct from  them  although  as  the  Supreme  Lord  He
encompasses all.
