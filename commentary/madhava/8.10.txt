The performance of beneficial activities at  the  time  of  death  by  those
whose state of equanimity has achieved mastery of the  life  force  and  are
able to direct it to the <i>ajna cakra</i> or the space between the  eyebrows  etc.
is spoken now by Lord Krishna. Yet even for those who are bereft of  mastery
over the life force, true <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the cycle  of  birth  and
death comes about only through <i>buddhi</i> or spiritual intelligence,  <i>bhakti</i>  or
loving devotion and <i>vairagya</i> or renunciation. So  even  in  the  absence  of
complete mastery on the strength of possessing  equanimity  from  possessing
<i>buddhi, bhakti</i> and <i>vairagya</i> liberation will be attained especially  for  the
adepts.

In the Bhagavat Purana it  is  stated:  Relishing  the  nectarian  <i>lilas</i>  or
divine pastimes of the Supreme Lord, prompted by  loving  devotion  to  Him,
those  who  are  pure  in  heart  have  gained  the  wisdom   of   spiritual
intelligence as a result of renunciation and also have attained the  Supreme
Lord, Himself in <i>Vaikuntha,</i> the eternal spiritual worlds. While others  have
through equanimity of mind succeeded with great  effort  in  conquering  the
powerful  impulses  of  material  nature;  those  endowed   with   spiritual
intelligence worship the Supreme Lord  exclusively  achieve  dominance  over
material nature without any effort. The Moksa Dharma states:  Those  exalted
beings who take exclusive shelter of  the  Supreme  Lord,  propitiating  Him
exclusively with  fixed  single  minded  attention  attain  Him,  which  far
superior to any other endeavour. The Vyasa Yoga  states:  Through  spiritual
intelligence, loving devotion and renunciation <i>moksa</i> or liberation from  the
cycle of birth and death is  assuredly available; but for  those  possessing
equanimity of mind, <i>moksa</i> is expeditiously so.
