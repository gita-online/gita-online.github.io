<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>
<p>
The use of the word <i>raja</i>  meaning  king  illustrates  Yudhisthira  receiving
that  title  from  the  <i>Rasasuya</i>  ceremony  he  successfully  performed   by
receiving tribute from all  other  kings  and  crowning  him  so.  Thus  the
superiority of the Pandavas is illustrated along  with  the  inferiority  of
the  Kauravas.  By  addressing  Dhritarastra  as  <i>prthivi-pate,</i>  Sanjaya  is
implying that the destruction of his dynasty by his  own  evil  instigations
and unrighteousness is eminent.
