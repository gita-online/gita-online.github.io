The essential meaning Lord Krishna is conveying here is the establishing  of
a higher consciousness that sees all activities as offerings to the  <i>Brahman</i>
or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence.  Everything  is  spoken
as  the  <i>Brahman</i>  because  everything  is  emanated  from  the  <i>Brahman</i>  and
everything is contained within the <i>Brahman.</i> It should not  be  assumed  that
the unlimited myriad of  individual  beings  are  in  the  likeness  of  the
<i>Brahman</i> because that would be erroneous. The <i>Brahman</i> is the  whole  and  all
others are infinitesimal parts of the whole  and subservient to  it  because
all comes into existence from the <i>Brahman</i>. In the  Padma  Purana  the  sages
speak that: The Supreme Lord is verily is the essence and the total  of  the
Vedas. Everything is verily the vision of the Supreme  Lord's  consciousness
and the <i>Brahman</i>  is  the  manifestation  of  this  consciousness.  With  the
equanimity of one's intellect <i>Brahman</i> is realised to  be  the  performer  of
all actions.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
How can pride be relinquished? By offering pride to the <i>Brahman</i>  along  with
other unwanted hindrances. The  paraphernalia  offered  to  the  <i>Brahman</i>  is
called <i>Brahmarpanamas</i>  and  they  include  the  fire  itself,  the  <i>ghee</i>  or
clarified butter and foodgrains offered to the sacred fire as  well  as  the
performer of the <i>yagna</i> or  worship  who  propitiates  the  Supreme  Lord  by
offering oblations. So the <i>Brahman</i> is also the  performing  presribed  Vedic
actions  with  equanimity  in  higher  consciousness.  But  even  with  this
equanimity  all  are  eternally  subservient  to  the  Supreme   Lord.   The
Mahabharata confirms that  only  the  respendent  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is
independent everything else is dependent upon Him.
