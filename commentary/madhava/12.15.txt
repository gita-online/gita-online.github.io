In  the  previous  verse  Lord  Krishna  speaks  that  His  devotee  who  is
<i>subhasubha parityagi</i> meaning fully  renouncing  the  results  of  pious  and
impious actions and their derivatives of merits  or  demerits.  The  special
attribute being <i>parityagi</i> or full renunciation.  In  this  verse  there  may
appear to be  repetition  in  speaking  of  freedom  from  duality  such  as
pleasure and pain, joy and grief, praise and censure etc.  but  this  is  to
emphasise the equanimity that comes from  renunciation.  When  something  is
repeated its importance is being asserted to  emphasise  its  value  and  to
remind  His  devotees  that  renunciation  of  the  desire  for  rewards  is
essential.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Full renunciation is renouncing the performance of all actions that  do  not
support <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
This can also mean renouncing all actions that do not please  Lord  Krishna.
For example Lord Krishna is not pleased  by  pride  but  He  is  pleased  by
humility. He is not pleased by one who seeks recompense for  their  devotion
to Him but He is pleased by one seeks no reward for their devotion  to  Him.
<p>
One who does not desire anything except <i>bhakti</i> is known as truly  renouncing
all actions and the results  of  all  actions  as  both  pious  and  impious
activities result in <i>karma</i> or good and bad reactions from past actions.
