Again Lord Krishna emphasises  renunciation  of  all  actions  by  the  mind
especially the relinquishing of pride.

Now begins the summation.

By performing <i>yagna</i> or offerings of worship in propitiation to  the  Supreme
Lord and meditation on the <i>Brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence and other such prescribed  Vedic  activities  merit  is  acquired.
Since in reality the <i>atma</i> or soul is not independent  as  such  all  actions
performed are factually non-action.  Just  as  respect  to  the  father  and
mother is the duty of the children in the same way the living  entities  are
subservient to the Supreme Lord through the propitiation to the <i>atma</i> is  the
duty of all humans. This is given in a treatise known as Pravritti. Thus  it
can be understood by one who comprehends their intrinsic dependence  on  the
Supreme Lord is that it is solely by the mind that  renunciation  of  desire
for rewards duly manifests in one's actions.
