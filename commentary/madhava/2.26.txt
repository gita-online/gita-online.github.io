Even  though  the  immortal  soul  is  eternal,  because  of  its   constant
connection and disconnection with the physical body from time immemorial  it
believes it is experiencing  birth and death.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Thus exists this expansive samsara known as the endless cycle of  birth  and
death in the material existence. Until and  unless  the  living  entity  has
attained liberation from the material  existence,  one  is  subject  to  the
stringent laws of endless births and deaths in different physical bodies  as
ordained by the material   nature  and  so  are  following   natural  order.
Therefore by possessing even this small amount  of  knowledge  there  is  no
need to worry.
<p>
In the Shabda Nirnaya it is stated:
<p>
Eternal and permanent the  immortal  soul  is  known  to  be  and  also  the
immortal soul is eternally in accordance with the cosmic order.
<p>
Understanding in the knowledge that there is a  cosmic  order  to  existence
one should not grieve.
