The words <i>evam moksyase</i> means by performing all  actions  in  this  way  one
will by liberated refers  to  the  devotees  of  the  Supreme  Lord  who  do
everything exclusively for His pleasure  and  propitiate  Him  in  the  true
sense of worship whether they are knowledgeable  or  not.  One  who  is  not
knowledgeable of the Supreme Lord  is  deluded  and  on  receiving  material
boons from pandering to lesser gods is deported back to the material  worlds
of unawareness after enjoying the fruits of their merits. These are  deluded
activities of the deluded who are not only unaware of the absolute  position
of the Supreme Lord Krishna but  also  are  in  the  darkness  of  ignorance
regarding the Him being the ultimate reality.  Thus  in  conclusion  without
knowing  the  paramount  supremacy  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  as  the
controller of all creation and all existence and all the demigods and  every
other god; all knowledge no matter how profound or esoteric  is  superfluous
without any foundation because it is not understood in the  correct  context
as being connected to Him.
