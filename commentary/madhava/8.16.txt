Starting with Brahma the designer and architect of creation who  resides  on
the crest of Mt. Meru in Brahmaloka which is  the  highest  material  planet
all living entities are subjected to  <i>samsara</i>  or  the  perpetual  cycle  of
birth and death. Therefore it is stated in the Narayana Kalpa that:  In  all
cases concerning the  material  worlds  from  the  highest  Brahmaloka  down
through  the  heavenly  planets  to  the  worlds  of  humans  there  is   no
possibility of attaining the Supreme Lord without <i>moksa</i> or liberation.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
<i>Liberation</i> from <i>samsara</i> and attaining  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  only
possible through <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving  devotion  to  Him  exclusively.
Those whose goal is to enjoy in the heavenly  planets  which  is  free  from
disease, decrepitude and old age will reach  those  worlds  and  enjoy;  but
they will take birth in a womb again for attainment of the Supreme Lord  was
not their goal; but the devotees of Lord Krishna  whose  only  goal  is  Him
attain moksa.
