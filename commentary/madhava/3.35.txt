In this verse Lord Krishna is emphasising the fact that one  should  perform
the duties one is authorised to do according to one's station  and  rank  in
society. Arjuna was a royal prince educated and trained by the  strength  of
his might to uphold and protect <i>dharma</i> or  righteousness  and  although  war
enacts terrible suffering it was necessary and was  appropriate  for  Arjuna
to engage in it.
