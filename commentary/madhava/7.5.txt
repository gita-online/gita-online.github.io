The word <i>apare</i> means inferior and refers to  the  eight  principle  material
energies itemised  in the previous verse. Residing within all creatures  the
<i>sakti</i> or feminine energy known as <i>Sri</i> or <i>Laksmi Devi</i> of Lord Krishna is  the
caretaker  of  all  life  existing  always  as  the  consciousness  of   all
creatures. <i>Prakriti</i> or the substratum pervading material nature has  a  dual
manifestation gross  and  subtle.  The  gross  manifestation  is  the  eight
categories of material nature which is inferior to the subtle  manifestation
which is eternal and all pervading.  There  is  nothing  comparable  to  Sri
Laksmi as she is an eternal energy of the Supreme Lord  manifesting  herself
individually as an eternal consort for each and every <i>avatar</i> or  incarnation
of Lord Krishna. In the Narada Purana it states that by these two gross  and
subtle manifestations of  Sri  Laksmi  all  the  worlds  are  energised  and
sustained by the Supreme Lord.
