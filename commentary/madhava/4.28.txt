Those who donate artha or wealth for Vedic festivals and rituals also
perform yagnas or offerings of worship. Those who perform tapasya or
austerities as penance such as fasting for the propitiation of the Supreme
Lord also are considered to be offering oblations in  yagna. When such
austere penance's are offered as propitiation to the Brahman or the
spiritual substratum pervading all existence, the penance itself becomes
the sacrificial fire. Such an offering is spiritualised by the Brahman and
is an offering in wisdom. Offering in wisdom is to attain the realisation
that all knowledge and all propensities is ultimately  for the realisation
of the atma or soul which gives direct communion to the Supreme Lord
Krishna. There is a more profound meaning to the word dravya which normally
means donations and that is in reference to the nine dravya's that compose
the physical body being earth, fire, water, air, ether, the senses, the
mind, the intellect and the soul. Offering one's everything is also
considered offering all one's possessions and superior to mere wealth. The
great sage Yagnavalkya has echoed this by his statement in the Brihadaranya
Upanisad II.II.V that there is no hope for moksa or liberation through
wealth.
