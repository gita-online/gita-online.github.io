The Padma Purana states that the Supreme Lord Krishna is known as <i>visvam</i>  or
all pervasive because of  the  maximum  fullness  and  completeness  of  His
attributes. The <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form had not been seen  before
on Earth previous to Arjuna, the son of  Indra  seeing  it.  This  does  not
preclude that it had never been seen anywhere else in earlier  ages  but  at
no other time did His <i>visvarupa</i>  exhibit unlimitedly as much as  Arjuna  had
witnessed. The Brahmanda Purana states that  in  previous  ages  in  various
planetary systems the <i>visvarupa</i> had been seen by Brahma and  then  after  by
Siva and later it had been seen by Indra.  Therefore  others  had  witnessed
the <i>visvarupa</i> in special situations but Arjuna was the first to  see  it  on
Earth.
