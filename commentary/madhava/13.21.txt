Even after elaborating upon the applicable perennial  principles  applicable
to all creation Lord Krishna again refers to the  <i>purusa</i>  or  Supreme  Being
and <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum pervading  physical  existence.  The
word <i>ksetrajna</i> refers to the Supreme Being. The word <i>ksetra</i> also  can  refer
to <i>Sri-devi</i> or <i>Laxsmi-devi</i> the spiritual <i>shakti</i> or feminine  energy  of  the
Supreme Being. Being superior to all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings she is  always
identified by one word, <i>Sri</i> denoting majesty and opulence. How  is  this  to
be understood? <i>Sri</i> is the embodiment of pure consciousness and is  eternally
dear to the Supreme Lord. She never disintegrates and is  thus  the  fertile
field of inexhaustible  potentiality for the Supreme Lord.
<p>
Energised by  <i>Sri</i>  the  foremost  of  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings,  the
secondary creator known as Brahma combines the ingredients  which  manifests
the material worlds. Having willed to  create  the  <i>jivas</i>  from  Brahma  are
bestowed the <i>aham-akar</i> or ego from  Shiva,  the  buddhi  or  intellect  from
Parvati from through the knowledge of the  word  is  obtained.  Then  Indra,
Skanda nad Aniruddha cause the mind to ascend. The moon causes  the  ear  to
hear.  The sun causes the eye to see. The Maruts cause  touch  to  be  felt.
Varuna causes the tongue to taste and the Aswins causes the  nose  to  smell
thongs pleasant and unpleasant. Agnis the firegod causes the Vak  to  speak.
Hands should be known as the instruments of the sons of Vayu  known  as  the
Maruts. Feet are activated by the children of Shachi born of Vedic  rituals.
Yama is Payu or waste since he expels the things eaten. Shiva and  Manu  are
being the progenitors are known as <i>upastha</i> the establishers. Since  Vinayaka
removes the obstacles from people he is known as <i>akasha</i> or space.  Marichika
the son of <i>prana</i> or primal breath is known as earthly wind. Prithivi is  the
goddess sustaining the Earth. Varuna the demigod in charge of water  is  the
presiding deity of birth and death. Five sons of  Shiva  are  the  presiding
deities of the <i>Shabda</i> or five sounds which they are associated  with.  Prana
is known as happiness, Saraswati as vigour and energy, <i>Sri</i> as  consciousness
and will being associated with those attributes. Like Saraswati the wife  of
Vayu is also known by vigour and energy. According to circumstances  <i>Sri</i>  is
also known by various names as well even though her principle  qualities  of
majesty, opulence, consciousness and will are foremost. Kali  presides  over
misery and hate. Dwapara over jealousy and envy. Among the  demons  Kali  is
more powerful. In this way the  various  deities  and  demons  preside  over
their respective attributes.
<p>
Everything animate and inanimate in all of creation is to be  known  as  the
<i>ksetra</i> or field of activity because it where the  Resplendent  Supreme  Lord
abides omnipresent in subtle forms.  Because  He  abides  in  all  <i>jivas</i>  as
<i>paramatma</i> and permeates in a subatomic state of consciousness all  existence
as the <i>brahman</i> he is known as <i>ksetra.</i> Also He is known as <i>ksetra</i> because  at
the time of <i>pralaya</i> or universal dissolution like inhaling He  modifies  all
animate and inanimate things back into Himself and  at  <i>pralaya's</i>  end  when
creation begins, like exhaling He modifies all animate and inanimate  things
back into their original forms and natures.
<p>
By modification of the <i>ichha</i> or will to be  compatible  with  every  element
and dimension in  creation  He  is  known  as  <i>ksetra</i>  as  well.  All  these
modifications  are  considered  extraordinary  because  they  establish  the
embellishments of the distinctive attributes. The action  creates  something
extraordinary and is therefore  a  singular  distinctive  modification.  The
result manifested does  not  cause  any  modification  or  mutation  to  the
original and therefore modifications such as will,  ego  and  others  become
the presiding deities. Since all these are seen  by  the  Supreme  Lord  who
completely energises them all in perfect unison; He is  known  as  <i>ksetrajna</i>
as well, the knower of the field.
<p>
In some places in the Vedic  scriptures  it  is  stated  that  the  <i>atma</i>  or
immortal soul is the body but this  denotes  the  consciousness  within  the
body. Manifested in a body as one born the <i>jiva</i> is said to have taken  birth
with the body but this is because it appears as such.  The mode of  goodness
is known as <i>satva</i> which sometimes  is  referred  to  the  Supreme  Lord  and
sometimes even referred to the <i>jivas</i> but that is in regard to the   <i>atma</i>  or
immortal soul which is the eternal part.  The  Shabda  Nirnaya  states  that
<i>satva</i> is the attribute of noble righteousness.
