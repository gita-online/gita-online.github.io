One who understands that the eternal soul is incapable  of  being  destroyed
who can be slain and how?  The word avinasinam means indestructible,  nityam
means eternal and therefore by its own inherent nature the immortal soul  is
imperishable without any defects because what  is  eternal  is  never  in  a
state of modification. The word defect is commonly used for  that  which  is
not of perfection. The physical body of the living entities is  not  perfect
it is defective, thus the word destruction is applicable   to  the  physical
body but never to the eternal soul.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
The word avinasinam is indicative  of  one  whose  body  is  indestructible.
Eternal in form only applies to the Supreme Lord. Unlimited activity is  the
attribute of being independent, total independence  is  found  only  in  the
case of the Supreme  Lord,  who  being  immutable  is  without  any  support
outside of Himself.
