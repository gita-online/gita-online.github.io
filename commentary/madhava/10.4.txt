In these two verses Lord Krishna clarifies  that  everything  manifests  and
evolves solely from Him alone. He  begins  this  discourse  with  the  words
<i>buddhir jnanam</i>  meaning  the  ability  to  discriminate  between  the  supra
subtleties of eternal spirit in juxtaposition to  temporary  matter.  <i>Jnanam</i>
indicates awareness. The Amarakosa  dictionary  states  that  discrimination
between  performance   and   non-performance   of   actions   is   spiritual
intelligence and that awareness is the  inner  wisdom.  The  word  <i>damah</i>  is
restraint of the senses. The word <i>samah</i> is control over  the  mind  devoting
it to the Supreme Lord. The word <i>tustis</i> means  contentment.  Contentment  is
satisfaction within.  Also  it  is  has  been  stated  that  contentment  is
understanding the transitory limitations of sense objects and the  temporary
nature of material existence.
