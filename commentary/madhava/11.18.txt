In reference to Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or  divine  universal  form  having
His eyes being the sun and moon. It should be understood  as  both  the  sun
and the moon which originate from Him. Then this is in accordance  with  the
Rig Veda that states: Since all the 330 million demigods have been  produced
from just  a  portion  of  the  Supreme  Lord  they  are  glorified  as  His
individual parts. Also other Vedic scriptures have  stated:  From  the  mind
the  moon  was  created  and  from  the  eyes  the  sun  was   created.   In
consideration of the infinite number of forms within it that can be seen  it
is appropriate to say that all these infinite forms  have  their  refuge  in
the <i>visvarupa.</i>
