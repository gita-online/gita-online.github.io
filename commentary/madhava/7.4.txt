The eight categories of Lord Krishna's include the  five  elements  and  the
mind concluding with the <i>mahat</i>  denoting  intellect  and  <i>ahankara</i>  denoting
false ego.  The <i>ahankara</i> of the living entities is different  from  the  ego
sense of the incarnation  Ksiradaksayi  Vishnu  who  while  meditating  upon
Himself in the casual ocean  merely  thinks  I  Am  and  universal  creation
begins to manifest as unlimited universes from the pores  of  His  spiritual
body.
