Prajnavadah is a speculative concoction which appeals very much to the  mind
bewildering it so much that the intelligence accepts it even  though  it  is
not according to  the  injunctions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures.  Why  is  it
unworthy of sorrow? Because the intelligent neither lament  for  the  living
or for the dead.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
Those who are illuminated are factually  illuminated  by  knowledge  due  to
realization. They are prajnah or wise and knowledgeable. Avadah  means  they
who  are  opposed  to  the  Vedic  injunctions.  Whatever   the   wise   and
knowledgeable  proclaim  is  always   in   conjunction    with   the   Vedic
injunctions. Whatever is contrary to the Vedic injunctions on any  level  of
consciousness is not worthy of contemplation.  This  is  factually  what  is
meant here in this verse.
