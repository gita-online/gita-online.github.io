The Supreme Lord being indifferent  does  not  mean  that  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the
material substratum pervading physical existence can  manifest  creation  on
its own by itself. Therefore the words  <i>mayadhyaksena</i>  meaning  directed  by
His illusory external energy denoting that it is always  under  the  Supreme
Lords control and He is always the overseer. This is what  Lord  Krishna  is
indicating. The Vedic scriptures state: <i>Prakriti</i> which gives  birth  to  all
physical creations is itself  given  birth  to  by  the  Supreme  Lord,  who
determines the designation of all living entities according to  their  <i>karma</i>
or reactions to the actions of their previous life activities.

Now begins the summation.

In  the  compound   word   <i>mayadhyaksena</i>   the   word   <i>adhyaksena</i>   meaning
representative of the Supreme Lord is spoken by Lord Krishna as one who  has
His eye on each and every single living entity.  Therefore  He  is  <i>adhipati</i>
the Lord of all creation.
