<p><div align=justify>The Supreme Lord Krishna  is  called  Vishnu  who  is  one  of  His  primary
incarnations because He pervades all spaces. <i>Vishva</i> means all pervading  and
<i>vish</i> means entering into. The Moksa Dharma states: That the Supreme Lord  is
the goal for all creatures and conscious beings. By Him  is  the  world  and
the sky enveloped and His  glory  is  unlimited  and  immeasurable.  Abiding
within all living entities He desires their preservation and  best  welfare.
Because of His strident all encompassing steps  He  is  known  as  Trivikram
another name for Vamanadeva an incarnation of Vishnu.  It  should  be  noted
that His <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine,  transcendental  opulence  of  <i>Marici</i>  is  not
referring to one of the ancient sages of antiquity. His  <i>vibhuti</i>  of  <i>Marici</i>
is the primal breath that sweeps across  all  space   preceding  the  <i>Maruts</i>
which are the different types of powerful  winds  throughout  the  unlimited
trillions of universes.  The Rig Veda I.XXII.XVIII beginning <i>trini  pada  vi</i>
<i>chakrame vishnur gopa adabhyah ato dharmani dharayan</i> states: In three  great
strides Vishnu the protecter, who  is  undefeatable  upholds  the  perennial
principles of <i>sanatan dharma</i> or eternal righteousness.
