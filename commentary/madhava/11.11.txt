The word  <i>sahasraya</i>  means  thousand  but  can  literally  be  taken  to  be
innumerable  as  1000  suns  simultaneously  rising  in  the  sky  would  be
uncountable. Like the thousands of heroic  deeds  of  the  <i>avatars</i>  of  Lord
Krishna,  this  statement  is  made  for  elucidation  of  the   resplendent
splendour of the <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form.  In  the  Rig  Veda  is
stated: The Supreme Lord of eternal power and eternal energy is  of  eternal
brilliance even easily exceeding the sun. This comparison is  based  on  the
conclusive evidence of the Vedic scriptures and it is of no avail to try  to
compare it to anything else.
