Some doubts are spoken to Lord Krishna by Arjuna who exclaims that he is
unable to become established in equanimity due to the restless nature of
the tempestuous mind. In the Vyasa Yoga it states that in the absence of
regulated practice and subsequently gradual renunciation it is not possible
to become firmly establishes in the sate of equanimity.
