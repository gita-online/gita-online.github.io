When <i>adharma</i> or unrighteousness controls  the  decorum  of  a  dynasty,  the
females  in  the  family  unavoidably  become  unchaste  and   their   wombs
subsequently become contaminated. Because their husbands have  violated  the
injunctions of the scriptures and engaged themselves  in  committing  sinful
activities by the destruction of the dynasty,  the  females  of  the  family
without proper guidance and adequate protection  will  become  depraved  and
wanton  disregarding  the  etiquette  of  morality  and  decorum  and   thus
degenerating the females of the family will soon become degraded.
