Lord Krishna is revealing how one is able to triumph over the senses in  the
latter part of the verse. He states that even while experiencing the  senses
if one has their mind under firm control the  senses  are  also  under  firm
control  and  one  becomes  successful.  This  is  verified  by   the   word
prasade which devotes success achieved by the mercy of the Supreme Lord.
