Here Lord Krishna reveals the conclusion to the essence  of  all  knowledge.
The most confidential of all knowledge that  is  confidential.  <i>Sarva-dharma</i>
<i>parityagya</i> means renouncing all conceptions of what one thinks  or  imagines
religiosity to  be.  This  does  not  mean  to  renounce  righteousness  for
righteousness to all <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings  is  always  attuned  and  in
harmony with the Supreme Lord.  The  ultimate  goal  of  all  religious  and
spiritual conceptions  is  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.  To
achieve this one must first have realisation of their <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul
within the etheric heart. After surrendering and taking exclusive refuge  in
Him alone one is blessed by the Supreme Lord and by His grace,  He,  Himself
will accomplish this for His devotee.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
Knowing the absolute paramount position of the Supreme Lord Krishna  as  the
creator, maintainer, protector and sustainer of all  creation;  one  who  is
spiritually intelligent should incessantly attune themselves to adoring  Him
by <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion. Then with such commitment  of  mind,
speech and actions which is more precious and excellent than any other,  one
should surrender themselves completely unto Him thru the  bonafide  Vaisnava
spiritual master in one of the four authorised <i>sampradayas</i>  or  channels  of
disciplic  succession  as  revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures.  Awareness  like
knowing one is under the express care of the Supreme Lord and that  He  will
always protect one in all situations, arises on  its  own  like  flowers  in
spring. Such awareness is known to be the result of <i>saranagati</i>  or  complete
surrender.
