One who perceives that the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul is  only  the  witness  and
performs no actions; such a person can realise  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
After enacting the effects of one's <i>karma</i> or reactions to previous  actions,
the Supreme Lord causes the reactions to be  experienced  by  the  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings. But for the  Supreme  Lord  there  exist  no  enactment  of
previous  actions.  Vedavyasa  has  confirmed  that  the  Supreme  Lord   is
transcendental to material nature,  actions  and  time.  The  Skanda  Purana
states: From but a single desire of will the entire creation  is  manifested
by the Supreme Lord. He is the creator of  everything  but  nothing  is  the
creator of Him. He himself has stated earlier that: I am  the  Lord  of  all
creation. I am the progenitor of Brahma. Everything rests in Me. It is  from
me that everything has arisen. Know that all creation  has  manifested  from
Me alone. These proofs found in the Vedic scriptures and  also  the  absence
of any contradictions to this in the Vedic  scriptures  is  corroborated  by
the words in this verse of <i>prakrtyaiva ca</i> meaning: the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence in the unlimitedly  modified  forms  of  bodies
with senses. The adjective <i>ca</i> specifically establishes all forms to be  from
the Supreme Lord alone.  In the Shabda Nirnaya is stated that  sometimes  <i>ca</i>
is used to show additional  embellishments  and  other  times  to  emphasise
association and other times to show detriments.

Since for  the  inanimate  there  is  no  self-motivation  as  confirmed  by
Vedavyasa in Vedanta Sutras. It is  clear  that  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material
substratum pervading physical existence which is  inanimate  cannot  be  the
primary cause of creation in any way and the  creative  impulse  to  animate
from the inanimate is completely impossible and preposturous. Thus  in  this
instance the adjective <i>ca</i> is applicable only to the  Supreme  Lord  and  not
<i>prakriti.</i> in any way. What Lord Krishna has explained  in  earlier  chapters
about His being the original seed and everything is connected  to  Him  like
pearls on a string is what He is confirming here through association of  the
<i>ksetra</i> or sphere of activity and the <i>ksetrajna</i> or the knower of  the  sphere
of activity; so there is absolutely  no  contradiction  whatsoever  in  this
regard. Contrarily, hypothesising that anything inanimate can be  the  cause
of the animate is extremely  contradictory  and  completely  erroneous.  The
Paigni scripture states: Creation emanating from conscious  will  can  alone
be the main criteria. So in conclusion only supra-mundane actions which  are
not subject to any modification should be  considered  eternal  and  of  the
nature of the Supreme Lord.
