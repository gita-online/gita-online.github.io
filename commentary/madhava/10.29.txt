Being of the  form  of  <i>ananda</i>  or  bliss,  being  completely  spiritual  of
Himself, being the  delighter  of  the  people  Lord  Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
divine, transcendental opulence is known as Rama. In the  Shandilya  section
it states: Of blissful form, unlimited, from whom the world revels is  known
as Rama. <i>Ra</i> and <i>ama</i> are the root  and  together  as  Rama  mean  exceedingly
pleasing to all.
