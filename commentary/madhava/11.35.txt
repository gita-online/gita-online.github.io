Here it is explained why it is appropriate to propitiate  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna. As He is <i>purna</i> or complete He is known as the source of  all  <i>atmas</i>
or souls<i>.</i> Here He is addressed as  <i>mahatma</i>  the  greatest  personality.  The
word <i>atma</i> has been explained in Mahabharta in this manner: The Supreme  Lord
is pervading everywhere in everything, because He is the controller of  all,
the dispenser of the results of all actions, abiding in each and every  body
and the first recipient of all sense enjoyments and because  He  is  eternal
He is known as <i>atma</i> the soul of all. The Bhagavat  Purana  states  that  the
material worlds are a combination of <i>sat</i> or effect and  <i>asat</i>  or  cause  but
the Supreme Lord is superior to both <i>sat</i> and <i>asat.</i>
