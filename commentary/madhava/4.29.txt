Continuing Lord Krishna explains that others who are devoted to pranayama
or regulation of the breath offer the prana or outgoing breath to the apana
or incoming breath and the incoming breath to the outgoing breath. In this
way they arrive at the stage of kumbhaka or complete restraint of the
breath and this is considered to be yagna or offerings of worship.
