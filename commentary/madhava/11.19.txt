<p><div align=justify>The Varuna Purana states: Between the Earth which is equated to  mother  and
the heavens which is equated  to  the  father  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's
<i>visvarupa</i> or  divine  universal  form  encompassed  all.  The  mother  never
encourages one to perform unrighteous deeds and the Earth  never  encourages
such actions either. The father is always benefiting the  children  and  the
family and likewise let the heavens be propitious to us.  With  thoughts  of
this nature in the mind the various <i>avataras</i> or incarnations and  expansions
of Lord Krishna are not  normally  perceived  as  frightening.  For  Brahma,
Narada,  Vyasa  and  others  even  this  <i>visvarupa</i>  is  not  in  the   least
frightening but for others the resplendent Supreme Lord is  perceived  in  a
terrible, fear inspiring way. The Varuna  Purana  states:  While  some  find
fulfilment in seeing  His <i>visvarupa</i> others become frightened  yet  still  if
they are able to see it at all they all will achieve fulfilment in the  end.
All are not competent to see the <i>visvarupa</i> of Lord  Krishna  directly  while
others who see it during their meditation are  frightened.  In  the  Gautama
texts is stated: That some seeing the  <i>visvarupa</i>  are  very  pleased,  while
some others are frightened and still other aspirants who  while  not  seeing
the <i>visvarupa</i> directly still meditate on Him  within  their  minds  by  what
they have heard and read from others and  perceive  Him  in  that  way.  The
exalted devotees abounding in the three worlds according to  their  capacity
perceived the <i>visvarupa</i> Lord Krishna exhibited to Arjuna before  the  battle
at Kuruksetra. At first these exalted devotees also  felt  apprehension  and
fear like Arjuna and the demigods but in the course of continual  perception
of the <i>visvarupa</i> a feeling of exuberance and bliss bubbled  up  within  them
and all apprehensions evaporated.
<p>
Because  the  purpose  of  the  Battle  of  Kuruksetra  was  Lord  Krishna's
intention to alleviate the burden of the demoniac influences upon the  Earth
the <i>visvarupa</i> was perceived in an exceptionally frightening manner and  thus
fearfulness ensued. But in other situations  and  other  times  the  various
forms of Lord Krishna do not cause any anxiety or fear among  the  Vaisnavas
and Brahmins being His devotees. For those who are superior to  Arjuna  such
as Balarama, Brahma and Shiva as well as Draupadi, Yudisthira and  Bhima  no
fear arose at all within them. This has been described in  the  Agni  Purana
to explain the frightening aspect of the <i>visvarupa</i> in the correct context.
