The single reality pervading all existence is the Supreme Lord  Krishna  the
creator,  maintainer  and  energiser  of  all  existence.  All  creation  is
situated within Him and He is also within every  atom  of  creation.  Living
entities in the state of bondage or  liberation,  they  are  all  under  His
jurisdiction but those who have achieved <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from  material
existence are promoted to the eternal spiritual  worlds.  The  Supreme  Lord
although  manifesting  and  residing  within  unlimited   variegated   forms
simultaneously in an all pervading way;  yet  He  distinctly  separate  from
every <i>jiva</i> or embodied being of all gradations. Those <i>jivas</i> whose  gradation
is material such as trees are distinct unique  amongst  themselves  such  as
Palm trees, mango trees, apple trees, etc. which although  manifesting  from
the Supreme Lord's potencies are all distinctly different from  the  Supreme
Lord.  This  is  the  knowledge  of  distinctive  characteristics  and  when
developed into wisdom is situated in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of  goodness  from
whence arises <i>moksa.</i>
