Since the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  achieved  by  experiencing  spiritual
knowledge, He is understood to be the goal of all knowledge. Know  the  <i>atma</i>
or immortal soul by experiencing the  <i>atma</i>.  As  the  Supreme  Lord  is  the
bestower of the <i>atma</i> and the <i>atma</i> is only knowable through Him  then  He  is
the most worthy object of knowledge. If the  Supreme  Lord  is  knowable  by
other means then the words He spoke earlier  in  verse  13  <i>jneyam  yat  tat</i>
meaning all that which is worth knowing would make  this  verse  repetitive.
Now He affirms here the means to achieve what He revealed  as  the  goal  in
verse 13 negating any contradiction. The Supreme Lord knows Himself  by  His
Self alone. His knowing is not dependent on any external source  outside  of
Himself. In special cases He is  able  to  be  known  by  others  as  it  is
possible to know Him by His desire and also by realization of the <i>atma.</i>  But
only by His grace can this manifest and without His grace knowledge  of  Him
can never manifest. The  Supreme  Lord  is  self  illuminated,  He  is  self
contented and He is equal towards all. Therefore as He is  the  foremost  of
all, He is the object of attainment  for  all  and  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings should seek His grace for only by His grace can He be known.
