The influence which is the most powerful and destructive on human beings  is
<i>kama</i> or lust followed by  <i>krodha</i>  or  anger  which  arises  from  frustrated
desires. Those who hypothesise contrarily are not cognisant  of  the  subtle
difference involved  in  the  mixture  of  the  two.  Therefore  it  can  be
understood that  without  desire  there  is  no  opportunity  for  anger  to
manifest and indeed it does not. Since there are many causes of anger it  is
called <i>mahashanah</i> or great  devourer.  Since  anger  becomes  the  cause  of
committing abominable actions it is called <i>mahapaapma</i> or  great  sinner  and
because it is counter productive to all human goals of righteousness  it  is
called <i>mahavairi</i> or great adversary.
