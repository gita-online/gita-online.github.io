Those who have achieved <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from  material  existence  are
divine beings and enter into one of the abodes of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna
determined by their devotion to  Him.  The  Brahmanda  Purana  states:  That
divine liberated beings are not subject to the stringent rules  of  material
existence but enter into it and depart from it according to  the  desire  of
their own free will.
