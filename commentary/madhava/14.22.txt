The primary chracteristics is an  enlightened  being  is  equipoise  in  all
situations. Such a one has no  desires  so  nothing  can  disturb  them.  If
adversity comes one is not alarmed  and  if  prosperity  comes  one  is  not
elated. One remains balanced in all situations. In the Ballaveya section  of
the Sama Veda it is stated:One who transcends the three <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of
material nature is neither attracted, attached ,  repulsed  or  antagonised.
If some subtle qualities of <i>sattva guna</i> or the  mode  of  goodness  were  to
enter the consciousness in connection with the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  then
they would be accepted. But if subtle qualities of <i>raja guna</i> or the mode  of
passion and <i>tama guna</i> or the mode of ignorance were to appear they would  be
rejected immeadiately. The Moksa Dharma known as  the  Mahabharata  confirms
that neither the demigods nor the enlightened  one's  being  established  in
<i>sattva guna</i> can ever be without the subtle attributes of  <i>sattva</i>  thus  they
are  firm  in  their  convictions.  One  who  is  not  steadfast  in   their
convictions can never achieve <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from  material  existence
and attain the Supreme Lord. The person who is fixed within in  <i>sattva  guna</i>
soon becomes perfected and is assured all success.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
The illumination that may be established in others  is  neither  desired  or
detested by one who has transcended the influence of the  three  <i>gunas.</i>  But
sometimes it has been seen that illumined beings seem to  again  succumb  to
subtle desires by the subtle influence of <i>raja guna</i> and <i>tama guna.</i> This  can
be perceived by anger or bewilderment; but as they are always  in  communion
with the Supreme Lord within their hearts even if they appear  deluded  they
will still always seek the association of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  alone.
Even in the absence of happiness or the darkest adversity  the  devotees  of
the Ssupreme Lord remain balanced and are ever equipoised.  They  are  never
disturbed because of lack of wealth, the death of dear ones, harrassment  by
those who are inimical, bewilderment or fright. In all situations  there  is
never any decrease in their devotion if anything  here  is  an  increase  in
devotion because the devotee is humbly reflecting how the  Supreme  Lord  is
only allowing the minimum reaction  to  past  reactions.  The  word  <i>nengate</i>
means unwavering. The word <i>udasinavat</i> means indifferent to the inflences  of
three <i>gunas</i> bothe subtle and gross.  Those  who  completely  relinquish  all
activities  opposed  to  <i>dharma</i>  or  eternal  righteousness  which  are  not
pleasing to the Supreme Lord and His devotees will undoubtedly attain Him.
The words <i>sarvarambha</i> means abandonment of all endeavors  unrelated  to  the
Supreme Lord Krishna. Being impassive does not  mean  being  unconcerned  or
uncommitted it means being only dedicated to  the  essential  principles  of
<i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna.
