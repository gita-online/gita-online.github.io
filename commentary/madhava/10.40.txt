The words <i>kim jnatena  tava</i>  used  by  Lord  Krishna  meaning  what  is  the
necessity of all  this  knowledge  is  to  recall  the  primary  reason  for
revealing  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine,  transcendental  opulence  and  not  to
indicate that knowledge of them was not of great value. Since this  is  true
He would never state anything that is unnecessary or unreal.  The  Rig  Veda
confirms stating: Who can possibly be liberated from the cycle of birth  and
death without knowledge  of  the  Supreme  Lord  phenomenal  attributes  and
<i>vibhuti.</i> The adjective <i>tava</i> is used for  clarification  and  indicates  that
since Arjuna is already a qualified devotee of Lord Krishna.  The  knowledge
that has been revealed previously is for other  aspirants  and  votaries  in
various  levels  of  development;  but  the  knowledge  that  is  instructed
subsequently hereafter will be exclusively for Him. Again the  word  <i>kim</i>  is
used to emphasise the importance of other means to  perceive  Lord  Krishna.
If there is attachment and greed and no renunciation  what  is  the  use  of
penance? If there is anger and lust and no equanimity what  is  the  use  of
penance? The purpose of using the word <i>kim</i> is to emphasise  the  removal  of
attachment, greed, anger and lust. It is  for  affirming  that  it  is  more
important to perceive Lord Krishna's presence in all places rather  then  to
perceive Him in select differentiated places.

Now begins the summation.

The words <i>kim jnatena</i> also indicate that what is  to  be  mentioned  in  the
following chapters is more important then what has been  previously  related
up till now. This does not mean that anything  that  Lord  Krishna  revealed
previously is not important; but only that it is the foundation for what  is
yet to come. To be informed that what is to be told later is more  important
infers that what was told previously was  more  preparatory  and  denotes  a
connecting gradation in the information given.  To  be  properly  understood
and assimilated  knowledge  must  come  in  the  proper  sequence.  Only  by
reflecting and meditating on Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  as  a  collective  whole
will one come to realise its deeper purports and the ultimate truth.
