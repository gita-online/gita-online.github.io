The word <i>ksetra-jna</i> means knower of the field of activity  and  denotes  the
material body.  This refers exclusively to the resplendent Supreme Lord  who
is the knower of all material bodies individually and collectively  and  who
is  distinctly  different  from  the  manifest  and  the  unmanifest   being
transcendentally established  within  and  without  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings simultaneously. He is present within the etheric heart of  all  <i>jivas</i>
as <i>paramatma</i> the supreme soul and He  is  present  within  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the
material substratum pervading physical existence  and  He  is  even  present
within the senses although He is imperceptible to the senses  being  without
physical  sense  organs.  Verily  He  is  present  everywhere  as  the  pure
consciousness of the <i>brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence.  He  exists  within  the  total  fabric  of  creation  which  was
manifested by Him and He is present within even within  the  most  minuscule
part of the atom. Thus the Supreme Lord Krishna  is  the  ultimate  creator,
the  ultimate  controller  and  the  ultimate  reality.  There  is   nothing
collectively or individually that is superior to Him.  He  is  paramount  to
everything.  Lord Krishna  is  described  as  being  <i>nirguna</i>  possessing  no
material attributes. His form is completely spiritual  being  <i>sat-cid-ananda</i>
or eternal existence, unlimited consciousness and endless  bliss.  Since  He
is of all encompassing and eternal power, some  aspects  of  His  manifested
potencies  may  appear  to  be  contradictory  but  it  should  be   clearly
understood that they are never contradictory to each other.

The Bhagavat Purana states that the word <i>ksetra-jna</i> applies to  the  Supreme
Lord, who being  transcendentally  pure  and  beyond  any  modifications  is
capable of creating perfectly by His will alone in  the  waking  state,  the
dream state and the dreamless state. Anything contrary to Him is subject  to
modification and transitory and thus not eternal. Although in  the  previous
verse the words <i>etadyo vetti</i> meaning those who know refers to the <i>jiva</i>  this
was used because there are some <i>jivas</i> who are experienced  devotees  of  the
Supreme Lord who have developed themselves spiritually and  achieving  <i>atma-</i>
<i>tattva</i> or soul realisation possess marginal  knowledge  of  the  <i>ksetra</i>  and
thus in an individual sense they  can  in  special  instances  be  known  as
<i>ksetra-jna</i> as well. Otherwise to refer to Himself as the same <i>ksetra-jna</i>  in
this verse after referring to the <i>jiva</i> as <i>ksetra-jna</i> in the  previous  verse
would be contrary. Lord Krishna is the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>  established  within  all
<i>ksetra-jna's</i>, His <i>ksetra</i> consists of the  <i>atmas</i>  or  soul  of  every  living
entity in all of creation; whereas the <i>ksetra</i> of the <i>jiva</i> consists  only  of
their individual physical body. So for all practical purposes both  specific
and general  the  Supreme  Lord  is  known  as  <i>ksetra-jna</i>  and  in  special
circumstances extremely rare it is possible for this term to be  applied  to
an exceptional living entity<i>.</i>
