Placing the chariot in front of Bhishma and Drona between the  two  opposing
armies Lord Krishna said: O Partha observe all these Kauravas and see  those
who are favoring them<i>.</i> The use of the word <i>Partha</i> emphasizes that as  Arjuna
is the son of Kunti who is the sister of Vasudev who  assumed  the  role  of
being Lord Krishna's father; then  He  will  as  family  engage  Himself  by
accepting the position of Arjuna's chariot  driver.  The  use  of  the  word
<i>Hrsikesa</i> signifies that Arjuna will lose his desire to fight so what is  the
purpose of viewing the  enemy  army  on  the  battlefield  and  within  Lord
Krishna's words an innuendo of taunting was hidden.

Thus having been addressed  by Lord Krishna in this way, Arjuna  viewed  the
enemy soldiers among paternal uncles like Bhurisrava,  and  godfathers  like
Bhishma  and Somadatta, and acaryas  like  Drona  and  Kripa,  and  maternal
uncles like Salya, Sakuni and others,  and  brothers  like  Duryodhana,  and
sons like Laksmana the son of Duryodhana, etc, and grandsons like  the  sons
of Laksmana, etc. friends like Asvattama and well wishers  like  Kritavarma,
Bhagadatta and others and also the soldiers fighting on  his  own  side.  In
this way Lord Krishna placed that most magnificent of chariots  between  the
two armies in such a way as to give  a  view  of  both  the  armies  on  the
battlefield.
