In the verse Lord Krishna prescribes to endeavour for  equanimity  revealing
that the path is by yoga and by wisdom. Avaram means abominable  and  durena
means to discard; so discarding all fruitive activities  one  should  adhere
to spiritual intelligence and remain steadfast in  wisdom.  One  whose  only
objective is based on fruitive desires wishes to enjoy the rewards of  their
actions and is degraded.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
For all living entities the Supreme Lord  is  the  only  refuge.  When  this
realisation finally dawns upon the intellect  of  a  living  entity  whether
they are ignorant, wise or liberated they surrender unto  the  Supreme  Lord
without reservation.  Those who in delusion consider themselves the same  as
the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  who  is  distinctly  different   due   to   His
inconceivable  potencies  and  transcendental  attributes,  descend  to  the
hellish worlds of darkness without a  doubt.  They  are  doomed  to  eternal
damnation in hellish conditions.
<p>
In the Narada Purana it is stated:
<p>
Those who see a separation in the Supreme Lord Krishna from His name,  form,
attributes,  pastimes,  incarnations  and  those  who  deride  and  seek  to
diminish the glory of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  devotees  sink  to  an
existence in the hellish worlds of darkness.
