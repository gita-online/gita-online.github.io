Hari OM! The paramount nature of the Supreme Lord  is  specially  emphasised
in this verse. Of innumerable living  entities  existing  in  creation  less
then one-tenth of 1% attempt to endeavour for perfection. Of  the  minuscule
amount of living entities  who  do  endeavour  less  then  one-tenth  of  1%
percent actually achieve perfection.  The  Padma  Purana  states  that  even
among those perfected only a few such as Brahma and  Shiva  actually  really
know the Supreme Lord is Krishna. As far as others are  concerned  knowledge
alone  of  Lord  Krishna  is  sufficient  enough  to  grant  them  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from the cycle of birth and death in the material  existence.  In
the Bhagavat Purana it states that   even  among  100,000  liberated  beings
only less then one-tenth of 1% factually comprehend  that  Lord  Krishna  is
the ultimate creator of all. Every being who has achieved <i>moksa</i> in the  past
and those who are  achieving <i>moksa</i> in  the  present  all  without  exception
have been and are devotees of the Supreme Lord  Krishna  and  His  Vedically
authorised incarnations. This also applies as well to all  beings  who  will
achieve <i>moksa</i> in the future. Amongst all these eternal devotees  Brahma  the
architect of all beings in the material creation is the  foremost  and  thus
it has been stated in the Sat Tattva text that the devotees of Lord  Krishna
are the very best of all living entities.
