Lord Krishna declares <i>na tu aham  tesu</i>  meaning  I  am  not  in  them  which
denotes that He is not dependent on them but they are dependent on Him.  The
Gita Kalpa states: All the worlds are dependent upon the  Supreme  Lord  but
He is not dependent on anything.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
The three <i>gunas</i> or the modes of <i>sattvas</i> or goodness, <i>rajas</i>  or  passion  and
<i>tamas</i> or  nescience  all  arise  from  <i>prakriti</i>  or  material  nature  which
manifests from Lord Krishna alone but He is not influenced by  them  nor  is
He dependent upon anything.
