Lord Krishna gives an expansion of this in the next three verses. For  those
situated in wisdom these instructions are essential  being  the  means.   It
has been declared that  whatever  instructions  have  been  recommended  for
those  seeking   advancement,   these   selfsame   instructions   are   seen
distinctively in  the  actions  of  those  situated  in  wisdom.  To  assume
erroneously  that  something  is  pleasant  then  it  becomes  a  source  of
attachment. Rasa sentiment, raga attachment and rakti beauty are said to  be
erroneous assumptions.
