This ancient <i>asvattha</i> or banyan tree represents material  existence  but  it
is not perceivable yet it  is  seen  to  have  been  established.  The  word
<i>adi</i> means beginning and <i>anta</i> means the end which refer to the Supreme  Lord.
The Bhagavad Purana states: The Supreme Lord is the beginning, the  end  and
the middle as well. The Moksa Dharma states: The Supreme  Lord  has  neither
beginning nor ending, more the demigods  and  seers  cannot  penetrate.  The
compound word <i>asanga-sastrena</i> means the  wisdom  of  non-attachment  arising
from association with Vaisnava devotees of the Supreme Lord. With the  sword
of detachment sharpened by meditation on the  wisdom  of  renunciation.   By
this method the world does not become a place of bondage.  By  knowledge  of
the Vedic scriptures and practice the knowledge of the <i>brahman</i> or  spiritual
substratum  pervading  all  existence  will  be  revealed  to  one.   It  is
confirmed in the Vedic scriptures that: Meditation verily  is  the  way  and
the means for discrnment and detachment.  Such  a  one  will  not  be  bound
although others will.
<p>
The purport is that with the weapon of  detachment  one  should  sever  ties
with everything except the Supreme Lord Krishna and His  authorised  <i>avatars</i>
or divine incarnations and expansions. The  Moksa  Dharma  states:  When  on
surrenders unto the Supreme Lord one does not suffer or grieve.  Neither  is
one born, nor does one die. Such a one is verily situated  in  the  <i>brahman</i>.
Only one who has been graced by the blessing of  the  Supreme  Lord  can  be
elligible to become qualified to attain this. The describibng of  the  means
of severing  attachment  have  been  given  for  the  sake  of  an  aspirant
receiving the Supreme Lord grace. No other shelter or refuge exists  in  all
creation  other  than  the  Supeme   Lord   Krishna  and  this   fundamental
understanding must be realised. Since this  material  existence  is  like  a
horse with an unstable gait it is known as unsteady. That  it  is  immutable
is because <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of  birth  and  death  is  like  a
stream and endless until one achieves  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence.   This  liberation  is  determined  by   detachment.   The   firm
conviction that the Supreme Lord is  transcendental  to  everything  in  the
physical existence is the knowledge gained  from  the  destruction  of  this
ancien banyan tree. The Vedic aphorism <i>neti neti</i> meaning it is not this,  it
is not that clarifies what is the unmanifest.  Realising  that  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna is the seperate and distinct from all else is  what  makes  Him
clearly superior and paramount. He is the  primal  Supreme  Lord,  the  only
progenitor. All created beings including Brahma, Shiva, Indra  and  all  the
300 million demigods are  nothing  but  emantions  from  Him  like  rays  of
sunlight from the sun.
