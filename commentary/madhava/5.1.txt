Hari  OM!  Because  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  performs  such  wonderfully
phenomenal activities known as  <i>lilas</i>  or  pastimes,  He  attracts  all  the
worlds. Thus He is know as Krishna the all attractive one. The Kurma  Purana
states: Oh Lord since You attract  all  the  worlds  by  your  extraordinary
activities,  enlightened  beings  who  have  realised  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  the
spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence  call  you  Krishna  the  all
attracting one.

In this chapter Lord Krishna explains  the  equanimity  of  actions  further
expounding upon the themes from chapter four, verse 24: being  content  with
what has naturally been ordained and  chapter  four,  verse  15:  performing
actions in  renunciation.  The  word  <i>sannnyasa</i>  or  renunciation  is  being
explained to answer the question if <i>sannyasa</i> is  more  propitious  then  the
act of war is contrary to renunciation.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Hari OM! In this chapter the attributes of renunciation and  performance  of
actions are delineated.  The  compound  words  <i>sannyasyam  karmanam</i>  meaning
renunciation of all actions significantly contains the word <i>nyaasa</i>  denoting
equanimity.  Thus  all  actions  are  recommended  to  be   renounced   with
equanimity inferring that both <i>karma</i>  or  performance  of  prescribed  Vedic
activities and <i>sannyasa</i> or renunciation of the rewards of  prescribed  Vedic
activities can be performed simultaneously and hence the  question  to  Lord
Krishna for clarification.

Arjuna was a prince of the highest royal order  that  ruled  India  and  the
entire Earth as well. He was raised meticulously and comprehensively in  the
science of <i>sanatan dharma</i> or the  principles  of  eternal  righteousness  as
well  as  all  matters  regarding  governance   and   diplomacy,   war   and
conciliation. Due to this he was an <i>adhikari</i> or  very  qualified  being.  If
the divine discourse of the Bhagavad-Gita was meant only  for  Lord  Krishna
to remove the lamentation of Arjuna then there world have been no  need  for
Vedavyasa to record it in the Mahabharata. But in chapter  four,  verse  two
Lord Krishna reveals that  although  it  was  transmitted  by  <i>parampara</i>  or
disciplic succession  it  was  lost  on  the  Earth  over  the  millenniums.
Therefore Lord Krishna caused Arjuna to have lamentation  as  a  pretext  to
reveal the Bhagavad-Gita to the world again and He made  Arjuna  the  symbol
of the individual consciousness of everyone  to  achieve  knowledge  of  the
ultimate reality on their quest of attaining  communion  with  the  ultimate
consciousness and thereby realising the ultimate supreme personality.
