In this verse Lord Krishna again  reiterates  <i>sannyasa</i>  or  renunciation  by
abandonment  of actions. The words <i>sankhye kritante</i> refers to the system  of
analysis established in the <i>sankhya</i> philosophy of  analytical  conclsion  by
Kapila-deva, who appeared as the son  of  Kardama  Muni  from  the  womb  of
Devahuti and who is an empowered incarnation of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
His is the original <i>sankhya</i> philosophy acknowledging the  existence  of  the
Supreme Lord  as  the  goal  and  is  in  full  accordance  with  the  Vedic
scriptures. It should not be confused by an imitation <i>sankhya</i> philosophy  by
a Kapila Muni which  bases  its  precepts  on  analysis  of  matter  and  is
atheistic, not accepting the reality of the Supreme Lord hence  contrary  to
the Vedic scriptures and unacceptable.
<p>
The word <i>adhisthanam</i> means the body, the life airs,  the  ego,  the  senses,
and their inner director the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul controlled  by  <i>paramatma</i>
the Supreme Soul residing simultaneously in the individual etheric heart  of
all living entities. <i>Paramatma</i> is an effortless  expansion  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna's <i>purusa avatar</i> known as Ksisirodaksayi  Vishnu.  All  embodied
beings a<are manifested thusly by the Supreme Lord and are never in any  way
independent from Him. The word <i>cesta</i> refers to actions both involutary  such
as the heart beating and breathing as  well  as  volutary  actions  such  as
using the hands to perform <i>yagna</i> or ritualistic propitiation and worship  of
the Supreme Lord or utilising the mind to meditate upon  the  Supreme  Lord.
By such actions impressions are established  which  impel  one  towards  the
divine. The divine  is  transcendental  and  cannot  be  seen  although  the
liberated can perceive it in their consciousness it is not visible.  It  has
been said that the body, the life airs, the ego, the  senses  and  the  <i>atma</i>
are  the  instruments  of  all  activities  with  <i>paramatma</i>  as  the  unseen
controller of them all.
