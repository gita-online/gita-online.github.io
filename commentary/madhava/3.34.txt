The senses are constantly being motivated by the  force  of  attraction  and
aversion. Although Lord Krishna is emphasising  the  effect  of  restraining
the senses is known to be temporary only still by His  mentioning  it  opens
the possibility that restraint may have an influence  in  dampening  desires
if engaged in regularly with determination and it might  develop  a  lasting
effect. Of course <i>samskaras</i> or past life  impressions  have  a  deep  rooted
influence on all living entities even in the case of Brahma and  others  but
there is still  the  possibility  to  modify  the  situation  by  practising
restraint of the senses in a regulated manner.
