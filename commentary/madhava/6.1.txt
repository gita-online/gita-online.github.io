Hari OM! In this verse Lord Krishna speaks about  meditation  which  is  the
principle element of spiritual knowledge. He also  explains  the  method  of
renunciation by meditation. <i>Sannyasa</i> which is the fourth stage of  life  and
can only be accepted by a male  brahmin  in  the  renounced  celibate  order
performs <i>yagna</i> or worship of offerings to the Supreme Lord  are  recommended
along with propitiating the sacred fire. The sacred fire for a  <i>sannyasi</i>  is
the <i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence  and  the
worship for a <i>sannyasi</i> is  the  performance  of  Vedic  activities  such  as
teaching the Vedas, chanting of mantras,  developing  devotion  and  helping
the conditioned souls develop devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.  So
therefore one not devoted either to <i>yagna</i>  or  the  sacred  fire  cannot  be
considered a <i>sannyasi</i> or a <i>yogi</i> being one who is perfecting the  science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness.

Now begins the summation.

<p>
In this verse Lord Krishna speaks of meditation by such a <i>sannyasi</i>  or  <i>yogi</i>
as a great soul who residing in the  <i>Brahman</i>  makes  offerings  of  <i>ghee</i>  or
clarified butter into the sacred fire. By this  and  other  references  from
Vedic scriptures renunciation includes even one in the  <i>sannyasi</i>  order  who
makes offerings of <i>yagna</i> in all their actions  even  with  the  offering  of
their very self.
