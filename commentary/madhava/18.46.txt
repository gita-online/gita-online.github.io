Serenity, self-restraint,  austerity,  purity,  forbearance,  righteousness,
wisdom, knowledge and faith are the natural characteristics found to be  the
inherent attributes of Brahmins and Vaisnavas. Some of the  attributes  such
as righteousness and wisdom are found in a lesser  extent  in  <i>ksatriyas</i>  of
the royal, warrior class and in special  cases  powerful  emperors  such  as
Yudhisthira Maharaja who ruled the entire Earth possessed  these  attributes
even equal to that of the Brahmins. King Janaka was  renown  for  possessing
great wisdom and forbearance as well as righteousness. King  Kartavirya  was
known to be a saintly seer with knowledge of past, present and  future.  The
<i>ksatriyas</i> in general are courageous, steadfast,  fearless,  resourceful  and
righteous.  The  <i>vaisyas</i>  or  agriculture  and  mercantile  class  are  less
restrained and austere then the <i>ksatriyas</i> due to always  being  involved  in
activities of profit and gain supplying society with the  staples  of  life.
Because of their service to others <i>sudras</i> or the menial  class  are  serving
the three higher classes. If a <i>sudra</i> is found to possess superior  qualities
then based on such exemplary attributes he may become qualified  to  receive
initiation and become a Vaisnava  Brahmin.  Contrarily  if  one  born  in  a
Brahmin family exhibits degraded qualities  such  a  meat  eating  and  wine
drinking they have lost their caste and should be known as  a  <i>sudra.</i>  Among
humans  those  that  follow  righteousness  and  purity  which  are   divine
attributes, follow the path of God.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
It is acknowledged that when each  class  performs  their  prescribed  Vedic
activities some attributes from another class have been known  to  manifest.
For example a <i>ksatriya</i> may possess the  attributes  of  serenity  and  self-
restraint for in their absence propitiation  to  the  Supreme  Lord  is  not
possible. Devotional activities unto the Supreme Lord  require  serenity  of
mind and restraint of the senses  to  be  considered  actual  worship.  This
conforms to the earlier  maxim  that  <i>yagna</i>  or  ritualistic  activities  of
propitiation along with <i>tapah</i> or austerities and  <i>danam</i>  or  charity  should
never be abandoned. The mind  must  be  tranquil  and  the  senses  must  be
controlled and combined with purity, austerity and  righteousness  glorifies
a <i>ksatriya</i> and  are  most  appropriate  and  praiseworthy  such  as  Emperor
Yudisthira Maharaja's  immense  wisdom  and  self  restraint  or  like  King
Janaka's  exemplary  equanimity  and  serenity.   Yet  the  prime  duty   of
<i>ksatriyas</i> is ruling and protecting the citizenry and so to  be  fearless  in
times of war never fleeing from the battlefield until victory is secured  is
what is exceptional and praiseworthy.
<p>
The preceding attributes apply to <i>ksatriyas,</i> the attributes of  <i>vaisyas</i>  are
cow raising and cow protection along with farming  and  mercantile  affairs.
For the <i>sudras</i> it is loyal service to the other three classes for  acquiring
sustenance. Brahmins of course study and teach  the  Vedas,  perform  <i>yagnas</i>
and receive donations. These are the  perennial  principles  established  by
the Supreme Lord but do not apply to others outside the  pantheon  of  Vedic
culture.
<p>
Valour, courage, fearlessness, dexterity, resourcefulness, etc.  are  to  be
found primarily in <i>ksatriyas,</i> some Brahmins possess such qualities as  well,
<i>vaisyas</i> may show a little from them in times  of  adversity  and  in  <i>sudras</i>
they hardly  exist  at  all.   The  Brahmins  may  exhibit  such  attributes
according to situation but it is not for the sake of livelihood  but  rather
to set an example for  society  and  educate  the  noble  minded.  Educating
society according to <i>dharma</i> the eternal principles of righteousness  is  the
principle activity of the  Vaisnavas  and  Brahmins  to  the  <i>ksatriyas</i>  and
<i>vaisyas</i> who learn from them. The <i>sudras</i> are  prohibited  from  studying  the
Vedic scriptures and thus their duty  is  to  offer  service  to  the  other
classes as a donation or for renumeration.
<p>
Sometimes in extraordinary circumstance due to the  force  and  rapidity  of
events even the natural attributes have to abandoned and  the  enactment  of
contrary activities must be enacted in emergency for example to  save  one's
very life. Other times even those opposed  to  prescribed  Vedic  activities
participate for their best interests and benefit. Yet  for  the  spiritually
qualified and evolved <i>yagnas, tapah</i> and <i>danam</i> must  never  be  abandoned  by
the Vaisnavas and Brahmins as they are most auspicious  and  no  other  acts
are more propitious. 
<p>
Confiscating  wealth  obtained  by  unrighteous  means,   disciplining   the
disobedient, destroying parasitical economic power, imposing punishment  and
executions for heinous transgressions are the signs of the  mighty  and  are
enforced exclusively under the jurisdiction of the <i>ksatriyas.</i>  The  <i>mleechas</i>
or low caste meat eaters and other outcastes who are not  followers  of  the
Vedic culture should be properly governed by the <i>ksatriyas</i>  according  to  a
minimum standard of adherence.
<p>
The Vaisnavas and Brahmins can punish their disciples  without  causing  any
bodily injury. The disciples who have voluntarily accepted the  position  as
celibate student to learn the knowledge of the eternal Vedic scriptures  and
have been accepted by a Vaisnava spiritual master will  learn  their  lesson
and continue  serving  the  guru.  Teachers  and  relatives  can  administer
punishment  also  ithout  bodily  harm  according  to  the  degree  of   the
infraction. If a  teacher  is  found  to  be   defective  due  to  following
questionable activities then one  should  dispense  with  his  services  and
according to applicable laws cancel the engagement. If an  ordinary  teacher
unknowingly challenges one who is  superior  to  him  then  this  should  be
brought to  his  attention.  They  should  be  firmly  disciplined  but  not
abandoned as that would be offensive. Those teachers who are devoted to  the
Supreme Lord should never  be  abandoned  or  penalised  as  this  would  be
opposed to righteousness. Disciples never have the  right  to  criticise  or
chastise the Vaisnava spiritual master who gave one initiation into  Krishna
<i>bhakti</i>. Even if famous persons are seen performing  activities  contrary  to
the Vedic scriptures they should not be punished  if  such  actions  do  not
interfere with the mission of the spiritual master.
<p>
In times of  adversity  Brahmins  may  performed  occupations  ordained  for
<i>ksatriyas</i> or even <i>vaisyas.</i> But the <i>sudras</i> are  never  permitted  to  perform
the occupations of the <i>ksatriyas</i> or Brahmins.  <i>Ksatriyas</i>  in  adversity  may
perform the occupation of a <i>vaisya</i> and in extreme cases even  the  rites  of
the Brahmins but they are prohibited to  beg  for  their  food.  <i>Vaisyas</i>  in
times of adversity may only accept the occupations of <i>sudras</i>  and  no  other
and  become  carpenters  or  blacksmiths,  etc.  which  are  known  as   the
occupations of <i>sudras.</i> The <i>sudras</i> sometimes must accept  the  occupation  of
<i>vaisyas</i> but they are prohibited  from  any  endeavour  to  study  the  Vedic
scriptures. In times of greatest adversity a <i>ksatriya</i> may offer  service  to
the Brahmins or otther well to do <i>ksatriyas</i>  but  they  should  never  offer
obeisance to their feet. It is not  that  such  acts  of  a  <i>ksatriya</i>    are
unworthy or ignoble for performed expressly for the  purpose  of  concealing
oneself incognito it is equal to  even the activities of the  Brahmins.  The
most meritorious actions are those sanctioned and ordered  by  the  Vaisnava
spiritual master, who are all followers of the Supreme Lord Krishna  or  any
of His <i>avatars</i> or authorised incarnations and expansions revealed  in  Vedic
scriptures. It is much more meritorious  to  follow  the  spiritual  masters
commands rather then to remain neutral not opposing him.
<p>
Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasadeva has stated that by the  powerful  arms  of  the
<i>ksatriyas</i> and the spiritual wisdom and devotion to the Supreme Lord  of  the
Vaisnava Brahmins, then  the  protection  and  evolution  of  the  world  is
secured.
