Here the results of the action are being described by this prescription.  In
this way one without attachment to the senses does not  grieve.  Inside  one
is equipoised and peaceful. Contrarily by being  attached  to  the  physical
body everything is influenced by sorrow. The adjective purusa is  used  when
one is not subject to sorrow. Why is  there   no  grief?  Because  of  being
equipoised in both pleasure and pain. How is this possible? It  is  possible
by being determined.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
The results gained is described by this  prescription.  Not  by  the  merely
being equipoised and dispelling all sorrow does one  become  self  realised;
but this indicates the  correct  process.  When  one  has  relinquished  all
conceptions of being the physical body one  becomes  naturally  filled  with
the spiritual attributes that are  inherent  of  the  soul.  Fixed  in  this
awareness one is known as a purusa, thus this has been written in  Pravritta
scripture. The word  pura  in  purusa  signifies  full,  so  full  in  noble
attributes  and  full  in  wisdom  the  meaning  of  the  word   purusa   is
illuminated.
