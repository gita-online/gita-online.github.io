Indifferent and neutral is what Lord  Krishna  is  indicating  by  the  word
<i>asaktam</i> meaning unattached. The Vedic scriptures declare  the  Supreme  Lord
is neither known by speech nor  engaged  in  actions.  The  Bhagavat  Purana
states: The elements, the performance  of  actions,  time  as  well  as  the
variegated attributes of all beings are due to His  grace  for  without  His
grace nothing  would  exist.  The  Supreme  Lord  causes  the  creation  and
dissolution  of  unlimited  universes  again  and  again   continuously   in
regulated cyclic succession without any effort. Understanding this  how  can
He ever be attached to His actions. This is the purport. He never  increases
by creation or diminishes by dissolution  while  enacting  His  pastimes  of
performing any action. Naturally the Supreme Lord who controls  all  actions
can never be bound any action.
