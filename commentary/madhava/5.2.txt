The renunciation of the rewards of action recommended here is not  the  same
as  the  acceptance  of  asceticism  because  of  the  statement   that   by
renunciation of all dualities such as  likes  and  dislikes,  happiness  and
distress, success and failure  are  not  sufficient  in  themselves  if  not
accompanied by inner  adoration  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  This  as  well  as
austerities must be performed to qualify for th superior  position  of  true
<i>sannyasa</i> or renunciation from worldly activities.. Even though  renunciation
appears superior due to absence of actions it is  seen  that  ascetics  also
have activities prescribed for their order.  Therefore  there  is  no  other
<i>dharma</i> or path of eternal righteousness in the world superior to  the  order
of <i>Tridandi Sannyasa</i> which  can  only  be  awarded  to  a  Vaisnava  brahmin
intiated into one of the four authorised Vedic sampradayas  by  a  spiritual
master already established in sannyasa. Such a person who is devoted to  the
Supreme Lord Krishna or His Vedically authorised <i>avatars</i> or incarnations  is
superior to all beings. This superiority results from being  desireless  and
unattached in worldly, mundane affairs as well as being  completely  devoted
to the Supreme Lord. If such <i>adhikari</i>  or  qualification  is  acquired  then
such a person is already a renunciate. In the Narada Purana is stated:  When
such accomplishment is acquired one achieves the state of renunciation  from
the rewards of actions directly, even before realising the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  the
spiritual substratum pervading all existence. This  is  not  to  imply  that
Lord Krishna is not pleased by a persons renunciation  because  the  absence
of desire and attachment to the rewards of actions is certainly an  advanced
state but rather this is to emphasise that renunciation of the rewards  from
one's actions by itself is not enough to realise the Supreme  Being  without
a sense of devotion along with it.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
A person can beneficially perform <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic  activities
as well as renunciation of the rewards  of  actions;  but  between  the  two
<i>karma yoga</i> is preferable. Both are equally authorised and  when  <i>karma  yoga</i>
includes the renunciation of the  rewards  from  one's  actions  it  becomes
superior for without a sense of detachment and renunciation  activities  are
influenced by the dualities of life such as success and failure  and  become
a source of misery.
