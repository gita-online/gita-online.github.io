Lord Krishna states the word <i>siddhanam</i>  meaning  of  perfected  beings,  His
<i>vibhuti</i>  is  <i>Kapila</i>   the  son  of  Devahuti.  The  name  Kapila   is   very
interesting. <i>Ka</i> means of wonderful form, <i>pi</i> means to nuture and <i>la</i> means  to
absorb the worlds. The words <i>priti</i> or love, <i>sukham</i> or  pleasure  and  <i>ananda</i>
or  bliss  are  corresponding  words.  The  <i>avatar</i>  Kapila  having  complete
awareness knows past,  present  and  future.  In  the  Bavravya  section  is
stated: Kapiladeva is aware of all that was born  previously,  all  that  is
being born now and all that will be born subsequently. Through  immeasurable
pleasure, through nourishment, through bliss and through Kapiladeva  can  be
known.
