To whom is the mind a dear friend has been  mentioned  by  Lord  Krishna  in
this verse. Here the word <i>atma</i> should be understood as being  the  mind  and
the word <i>atmana</i> as being the living entity.  So  the  meaning  is  that  the
<i>atmana</i> or living entity achieves success by the  strength  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or
mind. In the Brahmavaivartaka Purana states: That the condition of the  mind
is the sole reason for human  beings  to  be  liberated  from  the  material
existence or contrarily incarcerated in the  material  existence.  The  mind
should elevate a human being and not be a source of  delusion  and  distress
for the mind has the propensity to be the best friend or the worst enemy  of
this there is no doubt. When with diligence and determination  the  mind  is
well governed it is like a best friend and then there are no other  enemies.
Therefore one should amiably govern their mind by Vedic knowledge  and  with
devotion to the Supreme Lord. The word <i>atmana</i> refers to one  whose  mind  is
fixed and unconquerable. But even so if the mind  is  not  directed  towards
devotion to the Supreme Lord it is not likely to be helpful in the same  way
as having a servant who does no work is like not having  a  servant  at  all
and soon the mind will become antagonistic to restraint and then an enemy.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The individual consciousness elevates itself by the mercy  of  the  ultimate
consciousness. Lord Krishna is perpetually the best friend  and  well-wisher
of the  righteous  and  spiritual  beings  but  a  perpetual  enemy  to  the
perpetrators of evil and unrighteousness. This means  that  to  one  who  is
devoted to the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of  His  authorised  incarnations
the mind acts as a dear friend by His grace; but for all others the mind  is
like an enemy.  In the end of the verse it is  indicated  that  the  Supreme
Being aides within such a person.
