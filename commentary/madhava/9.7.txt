For the purpose of imparting detailed knowledge Lord Krishna speaks  of  the
dissolution of all beings at the  end  of  a  life  of  Brahma  who  is  the
architect of material creation. This is what is acknowledged  by  the  words
<i>kalpa ksaye</i> which means at the time of universal  dissolution  which  occurs
every 26 trillion 439 billion and 400 million years on Earth at the  end  of
each Brahma's life.
