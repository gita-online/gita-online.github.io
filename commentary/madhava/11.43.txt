Lord Krishna is implored to conceal His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine  universal  form
and show His four armed form with <i>kiritinam</i>  or  golden  crown,  <i>gadinam</i>  or
mace and <i>cakra</i> or discus which Arjuna was accustomed to seeing. The  Vaihaya
Samhita  states:  Concealing  His  inconceivable  <i>visvarupa</i>   Lord   Krishna
revealed His human looking form which is to be meditated on.  The  sense  is
that the original form of  the  Supreme  Lord  is  superior  and  should  be
meditated upon as all other expansions and forms emanate from Him.
