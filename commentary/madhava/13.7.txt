The <i>brahman</i> or the spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  is  the
<i>brahma</i> referred to here. This is given as a reminder of  the  dependence  of
the Supreme Lord Krishna by whose  energy  everything  is  transpiring.  The
word <i>anadimat</i> means without any origin and beginning and  denotes  that  the
Supreme Lord is without origin and beginning also. If only <i>anadi</i> was used  a
doubt might arise that there is  an  origin  for  Him  and  so  how  can  He
manifest something without beginning if He is  not  as  well.  So  the  word
<i>anadimat</i> is used as a matter of clarification.  Due  to  being  complete  in
fullness with all transcendental  attributes  the  Supreme  Lord  is  called
<i>param brahman</i> meaning the  Supreme  <i>brahman</i>  and  is  both  <i>sat</i>  or  eternal
existence and <i>asat</i> or non existence possessing  a  transcendental  spiritual
form and formless being without  a  physical  form.  Yet  since  He  can  be
discerned by outward elements such as earth, fire, water etc. and  since  He
is emphatically eulogized in the Vedic scriptures. The  resplendent  Supreme
Lord Krishna, the immutable one is especially known both as <i>sat</i> and <i>asat.</i>
