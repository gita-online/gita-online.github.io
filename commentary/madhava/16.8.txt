Lord Krishna is reiterating  that  normal  desires  are  very  difficult  to
satisfy while emphasizing that degraded and degenerative  desires  are  even
more difficult to fulfill. Such vast  undertakings  and  prodigious  schemes
which are so difficult to accomplish  create great distress and  frustration
in the attempt.
