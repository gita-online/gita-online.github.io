For being the cause of vegetation growing clouds are known  as  <i>parjanya</i>  or
rain bringers <i>.</i> Actions are performed  due  to  <i>yagna</i>  or  worship  and  all
actions flow from and towards the Supreme as Lord Krishna is omniscient  and
omnipresent. Even though He is  eternal  He  can  be  known  by  his  <i>aksara</i>
potency known as the Vedic scriptures. <i>Yagna</i> is performed  by  sound,  sound
vibration is an attribute of all creatures who in turn  eat  food  that  was
produced by rains falling from clouds manifested by the power  of  the  sun.
This is the cycle of <i>yagna</i> that the Supreme Lord  is  eternally  established
in. This cycle was set in motion at the dawn of creation  by  the  grandsire
Brahma. Whoever does  not  maintain  and  perpetuate  this  cycle  which  is
beneficial to all created beings becomes sinful and  degraded  and  performs
activities counter productive to the  perseverance  of  all  life  and  must
suffer in the darkest regions of the hellish planets as described  in  Canto
V of the Bhagavat Purana.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
For renunciants <i>yagna</i> or worship may be  performed  by  the  recitation  and
repetition of  mantras. For those living as forest recluses the  austerities
endured are themselves the <i>yagna.</i> For householders the performance  of   all
recommended  activities  as  prescribes  in  the   Vedic   scriptures.   For
brahmacaris the study of  the Vedas, celibacy, introspection and service  to
guru. Fearlessness, charity and the development of <i>atma-tattva</i> or  knowledge
of the eternal soul are applicable to all of the above. For forest  dwellers
charity is sharing of food being roots and fruits  and  wild  vegetables  to
those in need. For the householder charity  is  donating  wealth  to  worthy
recipients in need. But all these actions should be  extremely  austere  and
frugal. In the Narada Purana the three activities known  as  <i>yagna,</i>  charity
and austerities are prescribed for everyone.
<p>
The words <i>Brahman</i> denoting the fundamental  spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence and <i>aksara</i> meaning Vedas should be understood to  be  distinct
from each other with  the  Vedas  revealing  knowledge  of  both.  having  a
separate but connected function
