spoke this verse beginning  <i>evam  uktvarjunah.</i>  It  was  seen  by  all  that

It has been perceived from the beginning of creation that the propensity  to
embark upon the path of <i>atma tattva</i> or self-realisation  manifests  only  in
those living beings who are righteous and  have  no  predilection  to  cause
injury to any living entity by thought, word or action.  It  has  also  been
perceived that success derived from embarking  upon  this  initiative  never
arises in those living entities who are bereft of these qualities.
