The manner in which after reaching perfection and  assuming  the  nature  of
<i>brahman</i> the spiritual substratum pervading all existence is  through  <i>bhakti</i>
or exclusive loving devotion.  In  verse  54  <i>brahma-bhutah</i>  means  assuming
one's intrinsic divine nature and as such one is  tranquil,  serene,  humble
and egoless. The Maha Varaha Purana states:  With  the  eradication  of  all
sins and demerits subsequently renouncing the desire for sense  objects  one
proceeds  progressively  towards   the   Supreme   Lord   Krishna   by   the
transcendental medium of devotion. For one  who  has  realised  the  Supreme
Lord even while in a physical  body  there  is  a  progressive  increase  of
spiritual wisdom even after attaining  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence.
