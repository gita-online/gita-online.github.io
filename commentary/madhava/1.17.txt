<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>

The thunderous sound of <i>Pancajanya</i> the divine conch shell  of  Lord  Krishna
and the Pandavas divine conch shells along with their army  was  devastating
and heart shattering in the sense that Bhishma and all those  in  favour  of
the Kauravas felt pain in  their  heart  as  if  their  heart  was  actually
shattered. The Kaurava army had also made an uproarious noise  just  minutes
before but it did not have the power to create any anxiety in  the  army  of
the Pandvas and this was undeniably proven by the potency  of  the  Pandavas
response.
