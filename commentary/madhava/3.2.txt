Hari Om! Previously it has been spoken that self-realisation of the soul  is
the  gained  by  the  means  of  spiritual  knowledge.  Lord  Krishna  after
substantiating the cessation of activities  with  words  of  wisdom  He  now
redirects Arjuna's attention to the performance of actions. In chapter  two,
verse 49 the resplendent Lord  Krishna  had  endorsed  that  cultivation  of
spiritual knowledge is by far superior to fruitive  activities.   So  Arjuna
is questioning why he  is  being  urged  to  perform  savage  activities  in
warfare which is bereft of righteousness, if the  attainment  of  wisdom  is
superior to performing actions.

Now the summation begins.

Hari Om! Wisdom and equanimity have been discussed. Now <i>karma yoga</i> the  yoga
of actions is being specifically explained in this chapter. Far inferior  is
action in the search of enquiry. Here the word <i>yoga</i> attached  to  <i>karma-yoga</i>
is being utilised as a means of  acquiring  wisdom  in  the  performance  of
actions.
