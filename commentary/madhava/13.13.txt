In verses 8 to 12 Lord Krishna has given the means of knowledge by  imbibing
the 20 super excellent spiritual  endowments  beginning  with  <i>amanitvam</i>  or
reverence  and  <i>adamvitam</i>   or   humility   even   before   explaining   the
modifications of the <i>ksetra</i> or field of activity. This is because they  hold
the primary position and  the  many  modifications  of  the  <i>ksetra</i>  hold  a
secondary position. Here Lord Krishna is not at all implying any  merger  or
absorption  into  His  nature  by  a  qualified  aspirant.  The  words  <i>mad-</i>
<i>bhavayopapadyate</i> means qualification for the Supreme Lords service.  When  a
<i>jiva</i> or embodied being becomes a devotee of the  Supreme  Lord  one  becomes
qualified to attain <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotional service unto  Lord
Krishna  and  subsequently  when  one  achieves  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material existence at that time one attains the  Supreme  Lords  association
in the spiritual worlds.
