In this verse and the next five verses Lord Krishna describes the nature  of
<i>karma</i> or prescribed Vedic activities. The knowledge that one  is  completely
dependent upon the Supreme Lord and that  the  Supreme  Lord  alone  is  the
actual performer of all actions guarantees that  all  reactions  to  actions
are neutralised by the fire of wisdom.
