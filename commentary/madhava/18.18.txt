Here Lord Krishna reiterates the path of <i>sadhana</i>  or  spiritual  development
and will explains in the next three  verses  the  distinctions  between  the
three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature. The science of  attributes  is  the
expertise in distinguishing the attributes and is clarified in  the  Sankhya
philosophy of analytical deduction by Kapila-deva  an  incarnation  of  Lord
Krishna.
