Even though <i>jnana yoga</i> or the yoga of knowledge may appear  to  be  superior
to him, anyway due to Arjuna's ineligibility he is only qualified for  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i>, the yoga of actions. Hence <i>karma yoga</i> is being  recommended  for  him.
The Supreme Lord Krishna states <i>loke</i> in this world there  exists  two  types
of humans who follow these  two  paths.  Those  who  renounce  the  ordained
activities of family life and society, to fully contemplate and meditate  on
the ultimate truth like Sanaka referred to by the word <i>sankyanam</i>  and  those
who adhere to the ordained guidelines of family life  and  society  and  yet
glean knowledge like King Janaka referred  to  by  the  word  <i>yoginam</i>.  Both
types are firmly situated in  righteousness.  Even  though   those  who  are
eligible for <i>karma yoga</i> perform actions for the protection  and  benefit  of
the worlds as  willed  by  the  Lord  are  also  deemed  as  <i>yogis</i>,  men  of
equanimity. Lord Krishna is  informing  Arjuna  that  he  is  ineligible  to
perform activities  of  renunciation  like  Sanaka  and  others  but  he  is
eligible to perform auspicious activities for the benefit of the world  like
Kind Janaka and others. This is the purport of this verse.
<p>
It is observed that by following  the  will  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
through authorised disciplic succession and the ordained injunctions of  the
Vedic scriptures many rulers  situated as  <i>yogis</i>  became  men  of  knowledge
although  performing  countless  actions.  An  example  of  this   is   King
Priyavrata who was emperor of the  entire  universe  engaging  in  unlimited
material activities  in  total  knowledge  as  given  in  Srimad  Bhagavatam
V.I.XXIII
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The method which promotes spiritual knowledge is known as <i>jnana yoga</i>.  Other
methods are those which promote  actions.  The  demi-gods  as  well  as  the
renunciates are known  as  <i>sankhyas</i>  because  in  them  spiritual  knowledge
predominates actions. The demi-gods by dint of  additional  attributes  even
though engaged in the actions of universal management are more  dominant  in
spiritual  knowledge.  Men  of  action  even  though  possessing   spiritual
knowledge  because  of  the  predominance  of  activities   are   known   as
<i>yogis.</i> Without either spiritual knowledge or selfless actions neither  could
attain <i>moksa</i> or liberation. No being can even for  a  moment  exist  without
performing actions and without spiritual knowledge one's actions will  never
benefit one's existence and lead it to the ultimate  truth.  This  has  been
revealed in the Brahma Vaivartaka Purana.
<p>
The word <i>nishta</i> means deep  faith,  abidance  in  this  under  direction  of
authorised guru leads to liberation without fail.  Actions  performed  under
such authorised guidance causes an increase  of  bliss  and  a  decrease  in
inauspicious actions. The scriptural statements of the Vedas  such  as:  not
by actions  and  not  by  progeny,  are  not  contradictory.  If  contrarily
statements like : not by abstention of  action  had  been  made  then  there
could be occasion for contradiction.  In the same  way  a  similar  approach
towards <i>jnana yoga</i> and <i>karma yoga</i> should be  accepted.  In  this  verse  the
emphasis of the two paths is that spiritual knowledge must  be  inherent  in
both indicating that <i>jnana yoga</i> is more suitable for <i>moksa.</i>
