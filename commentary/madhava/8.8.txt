In this verse Lord Krishna reveals the methodology  of  remaining  fixed  in
the divine, transcendental nature. The words <i>abhyasa  yoga  yuktena</i>  meaning
engagement in yoga,  is  what  leads  to  purity  of  mind  and  equanimity.
Therefore it is  practically  the  practice  of  eqanimity.  The  <i>Purusa</i>  or
supreme being is divine and  dwells within the <i>puri</i> or  city  of  the  human
body with nine gates being two eyes, two ears two nostrils, one mouth  etc.,
in entirety. The <i>Purusa</i> is never enveloped by anything internally not is  He
ever enveloped by anything externally. The  word  <i>divyam</i>  means  divine  and
denotes reveling in all species of creation  along  with  their  activities.
The word <i>divyam</i> indicates this having for its root the word <i>div</i> which  means
to revel.
