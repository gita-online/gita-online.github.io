<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>
<p>
To properly illustrate the consistency  in  the  conversation  between  Lord
Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield, Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa  has  quoted
the  first  27  verses  in  chapter  one   beginning   <i>dharma-ksetra   kuru-</i>
<i>ksetra</i> refering to Kuruksetra as the land of righteousness.
<p>
Now when King Dhritarastra  learned  that  Lord  Krishna  had  accepted  the
position of chariot driver for Arjuna, he  immediately  was  suspicious  and
became doubtful of  his son, Duryodhana's chances for victory. At that  time
he asked his minister Sanjaya a redundant question as what did his sons  and
the son of his brother do in the first verse of chapter one<i>.</i>
<p>
It  should  be  understood  in  the  correct  context  that  the  revelatory
instructions given by Lord Krishna to Arjuna in the  700  verses  of  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita  that  is   revealed   within   Krishna   Dwaipayana   Vyasa's
monumental, historical epic, Mahabharata; as  to  what  was  being  told  by
Sanjaya to Dhritarastra is actually  a  conversation  described  to  Arjunas
great, grandson, Emperor Janamejaya by Vaisampayana Muni and it  is  he  who
is expressing the words <i>dhritarastra uvaca</i> meaning Dhritarastra said<i>.</i>
<p>
Srimad Bhagavad-Gita begins with Dhritarastra asking Sanjaya:  What  did  my
sons and the sons of Pandu, assembled at the righteous  land  of  Kuruksetra
desirious of battle do? Now the question  which  arises,  is  what  was  the
necessity of Dhritarastra asking Sanjaya what did they do; when  he  himself
in the same verse says: they are assembled desirous of  battle.  The  reason
he is asking is because Kuruksetra is the land of righteousness.
<p>
Dhritarastra was thinking: Kuruksetra is famous as  the  land  of  sacrifice
for the demigods and also  the  abode  of  <i>brahma-jnana,</i>  knowledge  of  the
Ultimate Truth for all living  entities.  He  was  worried  that  under  the
potent influence  of  Kuruksetra's  righteous  land,  his  sons  would  have
decided to return half of the kingdom back unto the sons of Pandu now  being
free from all jealously? Or is it that the sons of Pandu  fearing  that  the
destruction of a dynasty  is  an  unrighteous  act  in  a  holy  place  like
Kuruksetra and have decided that it's best to retire to the forest and  live
as renunciates for the rest of their lives?
<p>
By addressing Sanjaya, Dhritarastra means  that  by  the  mercy  of  Krishna
Dwaipayana Vyasa, Sanjaya has become free from attachment and  aversion  and
thus he will certainly speak the truth.  By  using  the  word  <i>mamakah</i>   and
<i>pandavah</i> in referring to his sons and the sons of Pandu indicates  disparity
and shows that Dhritarastra did not accept the sons of his deceased  brother
Pandu as he did his own sons and this reveals his enmity towards them.
<p>
<i>Ksetra</i> also means field of cultivation. Just as in a rice  field  there  are
unwanted  grasses  looking  exactly  like  the  rice  paddy  which  must  be
uprooted. Similarly the use of the word <i>dharma-ksetra is</i>  indicative    that
the unrighteous sons of Dhritarastra will also be uprooted.
