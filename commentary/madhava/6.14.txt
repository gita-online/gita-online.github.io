Abstention from performing regulatory fasting such as <i>Ekadasi</i> which  is  the
11th day of the waxing or waning moon is sanctioned only for  the  weak  and
invalid.  In the Narada Purana it states: That  one  who  is  strong  having
given up sleep, food, fear, lethargy and actions, meditates  within  on  the
Supreme Lord Krishna or His authorised incarnations  with  eyes  half-closed
focused on the tip of the nose or the space  between  the  eyebrows  attains
equanimity of mind.
