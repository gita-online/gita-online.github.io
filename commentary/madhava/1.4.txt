Duryodhana's use of the words <i>atra surah</i> in addressing Drona is an  innuendo
meaning: If you are thinking that because the  Pandavas  army  commanded  by
Dristayumna are less than ours they can be  easily  defeated  and  there  is
nothing to worry about you are  mistaken.  These  warriors  are  all  mighty
bowmen, the arrows from whose bows can never be thwarted by any  enemy.  Not
only that but their expertise in the art of warfare  is  equal  to  that  of
Bhima and Arjuna. Yuyudhana  who  is  also  known  as  Satyaki,  Virata  and
Drupada are distinguished as <i>maha-ratha</i> meaning  the  mightiest  of  chariot
warriors.
