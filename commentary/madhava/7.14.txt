Why has the delusion of <i>maya</i> or illusory impressions superimposed  upon  the
mind been unable to be overcome since time immemorial? Lord Krishna  reveals
that it is because it is  <i>daivi</i>  meaning divine is this  illusion.  This  is
the purport. Illusion is that which beguiles and bewilders people.  <i>Maya</i>  by
her activity of permeating creation deludes all people by her  potent  power
of  allusion  which  causes  all  people  to   follow   desire   and   sense
gratification. Therefore definitions of <i>daivi</i> yields such  explanations  as:
lustrous, sport or play, desire to conquer, splendour, adoration,  pleasure,
imagination, brilliance and movement. But why is this  <i>maya</i>  divine?  It  is
because it is under the control of the Supreme Lord  and  He  alone  is  its
controller. The Vyasa Yoga states that: <i>Sri</i> the Goddess of  Fortune  Laxsmi<i>,</i>
<i>Bhu</i> the Goddess of the Earth and <i>Durga</i> the external material energy are  the
distinct forms of this grand illusion. Regarding <i>Sri Laxsmi,</i>  she  does  not
partake of the endless energies  of  the  Supreme  Lord  as  she  has  taken
complete shelter in Him. Because of such propensity Brahma,  Rudra  and  all
the demigods do not possess even  a  minor  portion  of  her  manifestation.
Having received the grace of the Supreme  Lord  by  taking  complete  refuge
within Him nothing can ever overcome her power. But yet  the  question  will
still persist of how can this <i>maya</i> be overcome? To answer this Lord  Krishna
replies with the words: <i>mam  eva  ye  prapadyante</i>  meaning  only  those  who
surrender unto Him. Those who renounce all else and take  exclusive  shelter
of Him alone can surmount this <i>maya.</i> Those who  humbly  serve  and  devoutly
worship the spiritual master in adoration, such worship surely reaches  unto
the Supreme Lord because they  have  realised  that  their  holy  preceptors
greatness is due to the fact that the Supreme  Lord  has  manifested  within
His heart. The Narada Purana states: The <i>madhya</i> or intermediate humans  duly
propitiate the holy preceptor due to the  Supreme  Lord  manifesting  within
him. The <i>uttama</i> or topmost  human  beings  propitiate  all  beings  as  they
recognise the Supreme Lord in all beings. In the Bhagavat Purana it  states:
That the Supreme Lord through the form of consciousness which  pervades  the
mind of the spiritual master teaches the humble aspirant true  wisdom  about
Himself.
