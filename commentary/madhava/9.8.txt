Even as one capable of walking may still take assistance of a stick, in  the
same way although the Supreme Lord Krishna is fully capable of creating  all
the universes on His own, He directs <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum  to
fulfill this task. The Moksa Dharma states:  One  should  not  consider  the
Supreme Lord, who is the repository of all attributes, to be dependent  upon
others like normal living entities. Comprehending the Supreme  Lord  through
seven subtle forms and five subsidiary  forms  those  who  are  situated  in
equanimity  achieves  <i>Parabrahman</i>  or  the  personality  who  manifests  the
spiritual substratum pervading all existence. In the  Rig  Veda  is  stated:
The immeasurable power of the  Supreme  Lord  does  not  get  diminished  or
exhausted in any manner although He engages His external energy <i>prakriti</i>  in
creation, dissolution etc. In the Bhagavat Purana is  stated:  Each  of  the
Supreme  Lord's  attributes  have  their  own  innumerable  attributes   and
innumerable forms. Why is the Supreme Lord referred  to  as  <i>Parabrahman</i>  or
<i>brahman?</i> In the Atharva Veda it states: It is because He being  the  Supreme
absolute truth, makes others realise the Supreme absolute truth.  His  power
is paramount and multifaceted. Who else can  compare  or  compete  with  His
innumerable divine pastimes all eternally existing simultaneously. Even  the
four-faced Brahma who is capable of counting all the grains of sand  in  the
world is unable to even speak of all the  Supreme  Lord's  <i>lilas</i>  let  alone
perform any of them. O Supreme Lord no one  is  capable  of  describing  all
Your infinite attributes neither in ancient  times  or  the  present  times.
<i>Prakriti</i> is completely dependent upon the Supreme Lord  who  is  verily  the
maintainer, the sustainer and the energiser of all actions.  Dependent  upon
nothing but Himself the Supreme Lord by  His  own  power  and  will  directs
<i>prakriti</i> to perform  actions  by  which  all  the  worlds  in  the  all  the
planetary systems are created maintained and dissolved.
