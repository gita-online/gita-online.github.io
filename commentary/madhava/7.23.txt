The conceptions of an impersonal unmanifest god  is  what  causes  illusion.
People who are under the influence of an impersonal conception  of  god  are
essentially bewildered by God Himself. Only  those  who  are  aware  of  the
Supreme  Lord  possessing  form,  qualities,  attributes,  personality   and
propitiate Him with loving devotion are able to cross  over  this  ocean  of
illusion. Gross illusion is the  Supreme  Lord's  external  potency  and  it
manifest as external energy in the form of the demigoddess  known  as  <i>Maya</i>;
both are under the control and subservient  to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
Therefore everyone should surrender without hesitation in <i>ananya bhakti</i>  or
unadulterated devotion. This <i>ananya bhakti</i> is uncompromising and  should  be
know as that devotion which is dedicated to the Supreme Lord exclusively  in
all its entirety. This capacity of fullness of devotion has  no  possibility
of arising anywhere else except for the Supreme Lord. Offerings  to  Brahma,
Shiva and all  other demigods should be done as  a  preliminary  worship  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna and nothing more, because all of the  demigods  are
part of Him and subservient to Him. Comprehending this one  can  attain  Him
but not by or through any other means.

Vasudeva is a name of Lord Krishna meaning the cause of all  causes.  He  is
the only whole. All else are merely parts. The only  complete  one  is  Him.
The spiritually intelligent who realise this within are very  rare  in  this
world while in retrospect we are all  actually  looking  for  this  internal
realisation and until we achieve it are merely  aspirants.  Yet  even  after
having this internal realisation those  who  propitiate  Brahma,  Shiva  and
other impersonal gods as being something superior; by such worshipping  they
enter the dark  dreary  worlds  of  obscurity,  which  is  full  of  endless
suffering and misery,  taking  birth  in  a  family  without  the  light  of
awareness. The irreplaceable awareness that  only  Lord  Krishna  is  to  be
propitiated exclusively and  no  other.  Without  the  awareness  that  Lord
Krishna is  to  be  propitiated  first  and  foremost,  any  and  all  other
propitiation's  become  disparate  an  have  no   efficacy.  Knowledge  then
degenerated to be utilised only for the satisfaction  and  gratification  of
the temporary  physical  body.  If  by  reflection  and  discrimination  one
becomes aware of the truth and achieves the realisation  of  Lord  Krishna's
supreme position then it should  be  understood  that  all  other  gods  and
demigods are  all  subject  and  subservient  to  Him.  Worship  erroneously
propitiated unknowingly on false objects and inferior subjects  as  well  as
temporary gods; if later renounced  causes  no  demerits  if  one  does  not
return back to them, But it will still be cause for  reincarnation  and  one
will take birth again but in their subsequent life such  a  person  will  be
blessed by the Supreme Lord to gain rapid  recollection  of  their  previous
spiritual direction and be  graced  with  proper   association  to  continue
their worship where they left off at the end of their previous life.

Thus it  is  clarified  that  for  one  who  has  realisation  by  spiritual
intelligence, the immortal soul within the etheric  heart  of  all  sentient
beings is non-different from Lord Krishna. After innumerable  lifetimes  one
begins performing righteous actions.  After  many  lifetimes  of  performing
meritorious activities one achieves spiritual intelligence and from then  on
one is qualified to attain the mercy of Vasudeva, the cause of  all  causes,
the Supreme Lord. Those  who  are  devoted  to  lesser  gods  only  get  the
temporary material rewards which such transitory gods are  able  to  bestow.
While those who worship the Supreme Lord Krishna attain the blessed  eternal
spiritual realms with all its bliss and felicity. Knowing the  supremacy  of
Lord Krishna  those  beings  who  would  deign  to  propitiate  lesser  gods
thinking them independent of the Supreme Lord  go  to  the  dark  worlds  of
ignorance in all obscurity. Also anyone who considers the  demigods  or  any
other gods as similar to, or capable of being  equal  to,  or  greater  than
will also go to the dark worlds of ignorance in obscurity
