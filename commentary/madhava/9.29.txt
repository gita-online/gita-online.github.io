As Lord Krishna is equally disposed to all beings then one could mistakenly
believe that bhakti or loving devotion was not needed. He clarifies this
with the words mayi te tesu capy aham meaning as His devotees are to Him
that is how He is to them. Because He is favourably disposed to His
devotees He awards benedictions even if the service is not perfect and to
those who bear malice against Him there is not the least dislike towards
them from Him whatsoever. It is a fact that everyone is subservient to and
under the shelter of the Supreme Lord even if they are unable to realise
this fact. As one matures in spiritual wisdom under the guidance of a
Vaisinava spiritual preceptor then will be able to perceive the reality of
all beings dependence. Otherwise one will become arrogant and belligerent
puffed up by the pride of power, wealth or fame. The Paingi texts state
that: Because of ignorance such beings do not realise their dependence in
the beginning but after learning how to meditate upon the Supreme Lord they
too can come find refuge in Him.
