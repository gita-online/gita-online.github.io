The word <i>sat</i> meaning eternal  unmanifest  spirit  is  the  action  and  <i>asat</i>
denoting the temporary, physical manifestation is the cause. The <i>sat</i> is  not
evident in the beginning but because it  is  evident  on  manifestation  the
wise call the action <i>asat</i> being the  unmanifested  form  of  the  manifested
form and the cause. The Mahabharata explains that creation is  comprised  of
<i>sat</i> and <i>asat</i> and both are superior to material manifestations.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
Now Madhvacarya clarifies some of the concepts from verses 16, 17 and 18  as
well  in  this  summary.  Because  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna   is   always
propitiated by all His creation He is <i>Rig.</i> Since all His forms are the  same
in essence He is <i>Sama</i> and due to the fact that He is the  ultimate  goal  of
all offerings from all beings  He  is  <i>Yajus.</i>  Being  the  first  and  final
recipient of all <i>yajna</i> or offerings and worship the Supreme Lord is know  as
<i>Yagna.</i> As He is the activator of creation He is k<i>ratu</i> the rituals<i>.</i> As He  is
not supported by anything other than Himself, He is <i>svadha</i> offerings to  the
anscestors<i>.</i> As He is always meditated upon He is <i>mantra</i>  the  Vedic  chants<i>.</i>
As He is solace for the afflicted He  is  <i>saranam</i>  or  shelter.  Since  Lord
Krishna is superior to Brahma, Siva, the demigods or any other gods,  He  is
<i>ajya</i> the first offering of ghee<i>.</i> As He is  the  holder  of  <i>dara</i>  the  conch
shell He is <i>dhata</i> the holder<i>.</i> As He, Himself is the oblations  of  <i>yagna</i>  He
is <i>hutam</i> or the offering in  the  fire.  As  He  is  the  energiser  of  the
creation which cannot be energised on its own He is <i>agni</i> the fire.
<p>
The  Supreme  Lord  being  completely  independent  in  Himself  solely   is
different from all the above mentioned things; yet He  is  inseparable  from
them all being their essence thus He is known by them. Since He is  referred
to as <i>OM</i> in Vedic <i>yagnas,</i>  the  resplendent  Supreme  Lord  has  a  His  own
personal tranccendental sound vibration known as <i>OM-kara.</i>
<p>
Since He patronises all the Supreme Lord is <i>pitaham</i>  the  father.  Since  He
comprehends all the needs of everything in  creation  He  is  the  <i>matah</i>  or
mother.  Since  He  is  superior  to  even   Prajapati  who   designed   and
constructed the worlds he is <i>pitamahah</i> the  grandsire  <i>.</i>  Since  He  is  the
ultimate abode of all He is <i>sthanam</i> the  basis  of  all.  Since  He  is  the
protector of all He is <i>suhrt</i> the dear most friend.  He  is  the  root  cause
for the manifestation of existence He is the <i>avyayam bijam</i> the  imperishable
seed.  Since  periodically  He  terminates  all  life  He  is  <i>pralaya</i>   the
dissolution concluding the end cycle for all created  beings  as  <i>mrtyuh</i>  or
inevitable death. He is also  certainly  <i>amritam</i>  or  immortal  and  resides
within the body sustaining life and distancing  death.  The  Shabda  Nirnaya
states  that:  Since  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  possesses  in  full   all
auspicious attributes and qualities, He is <i>sat</i>  or  the  eternal  unmanifest
spirit <i>sat</i> because there is nothing independent from to Him and He  is  <i>asat</i>
as well because there is independent from Him.
