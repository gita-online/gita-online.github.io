The <i>mahat</i> means that which cannot be limited <i>brahma</i>  denotes  the  expansive
material energy or  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence. This represents <i>sakti</i> or the feminine energy such  as  <i>Sri,  Bhu,</i>
<i>Durga,</i> etc. <i>Saraswati, Uma</i> and others are  partial  manifestations  of  <i>Sri.</i>
The same is confirmed in the Kashayana scripture which states: <i>Sri, Bhu  and</i>
<i>Durga</i> are the three forms of illusion which  binds  the  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings  in  this  world.  Although  Saraswati  and  Uma  are  only   partial
expansions of <i>Sri</i> in the Agama texts they to are sometimes  referred  to  as
<i>Sri</i> as well. The words <i>mama yonir</i> meaning womb confirms  that  the  feminine
<i>sakti</i> is existing to accept the seed of consciousness from the Supreme  Lord
and give birth to all life forms. In the Sharkarakshya texts it states:  For
giving birth by the Supreme Lord the goddess  <i>Sri</i>,  the  great  illusion  is
devoid of all suffering. Yet  she  along  with  the  Supreme  Lord  displays
herself as if suffering to delude the debased and  ignoble.  An  example  of
this is the sorrow displayed by Rama for  the  suffering  of  Sita.  Another
example is the tolerance of <i>Bhu</i> as the  personified  goddess  of  the  Earth
which is but her reflection. So much destruction and misery takes  place  on
Earth but she is incorruptible and even though she appears as  the  last  of
the five primary elements fire, water, air, ether she is the origin of  them
all. The Anabhimlan scripture states: She willingly  accepts  the  servitude
even though she is the matriarch  of  all  the  worlds.  The  Matsya  Purana
states that  <i>prakriti</i> sometimes can be referred by <i>mahat brahma</i> due  to  her
great benevolence and selfless service.

Now begins the summation.

According to the Shabda Nirnay the word <i>yonir</i> has three  distinct  meanings.
One is the wife. The second is the female generative organ and the third  is
known as the cause. Here it means the wife because Lord Krishna states  that
in the womb He impregnates.
