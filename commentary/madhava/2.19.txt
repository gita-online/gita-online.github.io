In the minds  of  living  entities  identifying  themselves  only  as  their
physical bodies, or as their species, planet, or country  as  the  case  may
be; the declaration that one who thinks that one can be factually  slain  or
one who  thinks  that  one  can  factually  slay  are  both  deluded,  poses
bewilderment. What can be factually slain is the physical body but  not  the
embodied soul. The living  entity  becomes  alive  only  by  the  energising
facility of the Supreme Lord  by  the  activation  of  the  soul.  Thus  the
Supreme Lord is always to be worshipped and glorified.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
If the statement one who thinks the living entity is able  to  kill  another
living entity independently on  their  own  would  be  considered  then  the
statement of the Supreme Lord in chapter 11, verse 34 kill those  whom  have
already been killed by Me would be contradictory. The  word  hantaram  being
applicable to the soul is applicable to the Supreme Lord as well.
