The method by which  one's  aspirations  are  made  available  is  known  as
equanimity. The equanimity of the Supreme Lord is also  known  as  <i>sakti</i>  or
power.  A  special  manifestation  of  this  <i>sakti</i>  is  called  <i>vibhuti</i>   or
supernatural  opulence.  To  attain  this  <i>yogam</i>  or  the  science  of   the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness of the Supreme Lord is also a manifestation of <i>vibhuti.</i>
