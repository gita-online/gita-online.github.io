Lord Krishna explains that the absence of  prescribed  Vedic  actions  which
hold even a miniscule residue for rewards is renunciation known as  <i>sannyasa</i>
or relinquishing of actions. <i>Tyaja</i> is renunciation by abandoning the  desire
for rewards and not the prescribed actions  themselves.  Both  <i>sannyasa</i>  and
<i>tyaja</i> are considered renunciation.
