For one situated is <i>atma-tattva</i> or soul realisation if  one  were  to  chant
the Vedic mantras while performing  <i>yagna</i>  or  worship  there  would  be  no
greater or similar happiness other than the  delight  one  having  communion
internally with their eternal soul. Also for a  person  so  transcendentally
situated there are no demerits accruing to such a  one  for  not  performing
the prescribed actions in the Vedic scriptures due to <i>samadhi</i> or being  rapt
in meditation on the soul within. During <i>samadhi</i> there would  be  no  danger
of incurring any demerits for any offense or merits  for  any  benefits  for
any being. Only  whatever  benefit  one  receives  from  direct  <i>darshan</i>  or
perception of the Supreme Lord Krishna within his  heart  will  be  obtained
during <i>samadhi</i> of such a person. If by knowledge alone there  would  not  be
any diminution in merits then that would also be the  case  for  Arjuna  who
was instructed to perform actions on the side of  <i>dharma</i>  or  righteousness.
For a person who has attained self-realisation and <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  and
is in the state of <i>samadhi</i> meditating blissfully on the soul within. Such  a
person is considered by Vedic authorities to be doing  a  very  great  thing
similar  to  performing  a  great  action  like  saving   the   world   from
destruction.  Consequently it is  indicated  by  understanding  of  <i>prarabda</i>
<i>karma</i> or acquired results  of  activities  that  the  performance  of  great
actions are due to the will of the Supreme Lord.
