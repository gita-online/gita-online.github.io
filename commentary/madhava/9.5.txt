Even though all beings abide  within  the  Supreme  Lord  they  do  not  get
attached to the Supreme Lord through their sense faculties. He is  not  seen
with the eyes or heard with the ears. The Moksa Dharma states:  The  Supreme
Lord is only known through intuition. Even though all beings reside  in  Him
and He influences all beings by  His  manifestation  of  <i>paramatama</i>  or  the
supreme soul within all beings, He is not attached to them by any ego  sense
so He is not a part of them. His manifestation of <i>paramatma</i>  in  all  living
entities is His tanscendental body with form and consciousness.  One  should
not assume that Lord Krishna has a body of inert matter  like  we  do.  Lord
Krishna's body is <i>sat-cit-annanda</i> completely full of  eternity,  wisdom  and
bliss. There is no difference between His body and <i>paramatma.</i>
