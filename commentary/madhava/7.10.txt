The pure fragrance is thus to show the  pleasure  of  Lord  Krishna  as  the
origin of the wonderful scent of the Earth.  The  Vedic  scriptures  declare
that merits alone rise to the Supreme Lord  and  that  demerits  lacking  in
purity never even reach the demi-gods. In the worlds of the meritorious  and
virtuous the creations law of eternal righteousness is enjoyed. The  law  of
creation known as <i>rita</i> represents universal order, truth  and  righteousness
as well as perennial principles from time immemorial  which  are  auspicious
activities for the benefit of all living entities. Due  to  such  statements
eternal righteous is known as an attribute of consciousness and truth  is  a
condition of the mind which one actually lives. There  is  no  contradiction
in statements from the Vedic scriptures stating even while not enjoying  the
Supreme Lord is still illuminating or even  though  devoid  of  food  He  is
still all regarding  the  Supreme  Lord.  These  perceptions  are  extremely
subtle and difficult to fathom. Even though the Supreme Lord does not  enjoy
material food like the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being He is more powerful  then  the
<i>atma</i> or soul endowed with a physical body. In this verse  the  <i>jiva</i>  is  not
mentioned because of reference earlier to the  <i>atma</i>  being  endowed  with  a
body as in a  dream  state.  The  Garuda  Purana  states:  There  are  three
different forms for the body one in sleeping, one in dreaming and one  while
awake.

By the word <i>asmi</i> the Supreme Lord alone is referred too. Bodies are  assumed
by all the <i>jivas</i> as well as the Supreme Lord. The <i>jiva's</i>  body  is  material
and thus in bondage being subjected to the cycle of  birth  and  death.  The
Supreme Lord's body is purely spiritual, eternally liberated  and  never  in
bondage. This statement is found in the Narada Purana and thus a  definitive
distinction    between    the     Supreme     Lord     and     the     <i>jivas</i>
is clarified in the Vedic scriptures.  By  such
crystal clear statements a person of reason  and  understanding  should  see
the difference between all embodied beings and  the  Supreme  Lord  and  not
harbour any conceptions concerning the  external  form  of  existence  of  a
<i>jiva.</i> The Gita Kalpa  has  stated:  The  pleasures  and  enjoyments  of  the
Supreme Lord are distinctly different and transcendental  to  those  of  the
<i>jiva.</i> The Supreme Lord is a transcendental enjoyer, He is only enjoying  the
spiritual and never enjoying anything material.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The Supreme Lord abides in the Earth as its fragrant essence which can  only
be meritorious; yet He awards all merits and demerits. Abiding  in  fire  He
is its brilliant energy, abiding in humans He is the <i>atma</i> the bequeather  of
life itself, abiding in the spiritually intelligent He  is  wisdom,  abiding
in the splendid He is exalted splendour and by the act of  manifestation  He
is the eternal seed of all existence.
