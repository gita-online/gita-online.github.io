Even by devout  and  diligent  study  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  and  their
ancillaries it is not  possible  to  witness  Lord  Krishna's  <i>visvarupa</i>  or
divine universal form.  Only  due  to  Arjuna's   unflinching  devotion  and
friendship to the Supreme Lord Krishna throughout his life was  it  possible
him to be graced to see this form, those without devotion can never  qualify
to see it.
