Not by propitiation to Lord Krishna by itself will <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from
material existence be granted. Nor will it be  granted  to  other  paths  of
religiosity that are not Vedic; but to all, in the manner which as  well  as
how much they surrender unto the Supreme Lord, He  rewards  proportionately,
granting the rewards to  each  accordingly.  Here  the  word  <i>bhajami</i>  means
reciprocation indicating that the most beneficial is  directly  propitiating
Him as direct service returns direct reciprocation from the Lord. Those  who
propitiate others are indirectly also propitiating Lord Krishna as well  but
without being aware. This is because Lord  Krishna  is  the  maintainer  and
energiser of all creation.  Lord  Krishna  and  His  authorised  <i>avatars</i>  or
incarnations are what  is  revealed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  to  be  the
ultimate reality and the ultimate goal of human existence.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<i>Tathaiva  bhajamy</i>  means  Lord  Krishna  reciprocates  rewards  to  all   in
proportion accordingly to how one propitiates Him.  Even  those  who  follow
other  religions  and  denominations  and  propitiate  others  and  are  not
following the Vedic culture in any way;  for  them  also  an  allotment   of
materialistic rewards are made available but in an indirect way because  the
propitiation to Lord Krishna  was  made  in  an  indirect  way  through  the
worship of other religions and denominations not connected  to  the  eternal
Vedic culture. So  although  it  is  true  that  even  the  worship  of  our
religions and denominations eventually reaches  Lord  Krishna  finally;  the
Agni Purana advises:  Since  sanction  and  entrance  to  the  immortal  and
eternal regions comes from Him alone and no other; therefore  by  all  means
possible one should propitiate the Supreme Lord alone.
