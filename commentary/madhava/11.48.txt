Since the Supreme Lord Krishna had exhibited His original two-armed form  it
is said that He has taken a human form but it should be understood that  the
form of the Supreme Lord Krishna  has  a  purely  spiritual  body  which  is
completely transcendental to material  nature  being  <i>saccidannanda</i>  meaning
<i>sat</i> or eternal existence, <i>cit</i>  or  unlimited  consciousness  and  <i>ananda</i>  or
endless bliss.
