It is not only by the mere renunciation  of  the  intention  for  fruits  of
desire but also it is  essential  to  renounce  the  affection  and  intense
liking for these fruits in whatever form one is remembering  them.  This  is
what Lord Krishna is emphasising here. The nature of spiritual  intelligence
is being always tranquil and ever  content.  By  acting  in  this  way   one
assumes   the  qualities  of  the  eternally   equipoised   and   infinitely
independent  Supreme Lord.
