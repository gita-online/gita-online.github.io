This question is asked in relation to Lord Krishna's earlier declaration  in
chapter III.XXX <i>mayi sarvani karmani</i> meaning  to  offer  all  activities  to
Him.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The purpose of inquiry from men of wisdom as given in the Agni Purana has  a
dual  purpose.  First  is  reconfirmation  of  the  knowledge   of   eternal
principles that they already possess.  Second  is  that  their  explanations
offer additional clarification. In this same way these  questions  asked  to
Lord Krishna should be understood in this manner. One should be  aware  that
Arjuna was not a novice bereft of  Vedic  knowledge,  he  had  been  to  the
heavenly planets and had received instuctions  from  his  father  Indra  the
chief of the celestials. He also had never broken his  vows  and  was  never
defeated in battle. So he  was  not  an  ordinary  being  and  was  somewhat
cognizant of Lord Krishna supreme position.
