One on the path of <i>jnana yoga</i> knows from the Vedic scriptures that <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from the cycle of birth  and  death  can  never  manifest  itself
until first attaining <i>atma-tattva</i> or soul  realisation.  When  such  is  the
case for  persons  of  wisdom  what  can  be  said  for  persons  of  meagre
intelligence.  The  word  <i>kama-rupena</i>  means  in  the  form  of  lust.  This
indicates that only with great pain and difficulty is lust  ever  fulfilled.
The word <i>duspurena</i> means never satisfied. This indicates that <i>kama</i>  or  lust
is an eternal adversary. Even the position of <i>Indra</i> in the  heavenly  realms
is born of this <i>kama</i> that is to be the king of all the celestials; yet  even
while trying to achieve the position of <i>Indra,</i> the  position  of  <i>Brahma</i>  is
sought because <i>kama</i> is never satisfied and it is  more  exalted  to  be  the
ruler of the material worlds then the king of the celestials  and  so  forth
and so on. The word <i>analena</i> means like a  fire  which  denotes  the  burning
fire of <i>kama</i> which is never satisfied  and  insatiable.   It  is  said  that
<i>kama</i> covers the <i>atma</i> as smoke covers fire, As dust prevents one from  seeing
a reflection in the mirror this <i>kama</i>  prevents  one  from  perceiving  their
<i>atma</i> and as the womb imprisons the embryo it is <i>kama</i> which  keeps  a  person
imprisoned in the material existence. This is Lord Krishna's meaning.
