By controlling the stations where <i>kama</i> or lust resides it can be  eradicated
but  Lord  Krishna  is  giving  special  instructions  that  <i>kama</i>  must   be
restrained within the senses at the very  beginning  well  before  they  are
able to make contact with the objects of the senses.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The Supreme Lord Krishna is the maintainer and energiser  of  everything  in
creation. His authorised avatars and expansions are His parts  and  parcels.
All  other  Gods  without  any  exception  are  mere  subsidiaries  of   His
expansions and these other gods descend downwards from  Brahma.  Demons  and
<i>asuras</i> or those possessing no inner light are  continuously  being  degraded
by <i>kama</i> and mixed with their arrogance arouse great evil. The  demoniac  are
the most deluded and degraded of all living beings. The least influenced  by
<i>kama</i> like smoke covering fire are the noble and righteous beings.  The  next
more influenced by <i>kama</i> like dust covering  a  mirror  are  those  of  mixed
natures sometimes aware  of  their  actions  and  sometimes  not.  The  most
influenced by <i>kama</i> like an  embryo  imprisoned  in  the  womb  are  the  are
demonic who are great evil doers.  Like  <i>Agni</i>  or  fire  <i>kama</i>  is  also  all
devouring that is why it called <i>analena</i> or fire. Therefore <i>kama</i> residing  in
the senses it can be restrained and destroyed only by the  weapon  of  Vedic
wisdom. <i>Kama</i> envelopes the mind and intellect prior to <i>atma tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation; but even after <i>atma tattva</i> is achieved it has  been  seen  that
<i>kama</i> is so powerful that it is able to exert its influence as <i>kama</i> is  never
satiated and thus vigilance is  still  required  before  <i>moksa</i>  or  complete
release from the material existence has been attained.
