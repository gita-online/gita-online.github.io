Concluding this theme Lord  Krishna  again  reiterates  the  performance  of
<i>sadhana</i> or internal propitiation. One should take complete  shelter  in  Him
offering Him all actions ordained in the Vedic scriptures. It should not  be
misconstrued that one can offer actions  that  are  not  sanctioned  by  the
Vedic scriptures for that would be an abomination. Only demons and the  most
degraded of living entities would devilishly conspire  to  contrive  such  a
travesty. In the phrase <i>sarva-karmany api</i> meaning all types  of  activities,
the conjunction <i>api</i> meaning although  denotes  that  without  surrender  and
devotion to the Supreme Lord no actions should be offered to Him.
