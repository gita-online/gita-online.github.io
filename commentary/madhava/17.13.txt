The word <i>saumyatvam</i> means tranquility, gentleness. <i>Maunya</i> means the  silence
of  reflecting  internally  as  opposed  to  projecting  externally.   After
achieving eligibility and qualification by  spiritual  knowledge  from  ever
reflecting one is called a <i>muni</i> which is derived from the word  <i>maunya</i>.  The
Balava scripture states:  By the power of a  <i>muni's</i>  meditation  reality  is
reflected and his realizations are  reflected  upon  reality.  Otherwise  it
would not be possible for a person to perform penance within the mind.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
By only performing authorized Vedic  <i>yagnas</i>  or  acts  of  propitiation  and
worship to the Supreme Lord residence is gained in  the  temporary  heavenly
worlds.  These  worlds  are  incomparably  beautiful  and  grant   unlimited
pleasure without the hindrances of old age and decrepitude or  any  sickness
and disease. The heavenly  kingdoms  are  inhabited  by  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings who had desires for pleasure and opulence but  still  lived  a  pious
life in their previous  birth.  They  are  similar  to  the  demigods  whose
limitations exceded their capabilities and failed in their  attempts  to  be
pure devotees of Lord  Krishna  due  to  cravings  for  pleasure  and  sense
enjoyment. Thus they gain the heavenly worlds and due  to  pious  activities
in the previous life and are exempt from  suffering  in  the  dark,  hellish
planets. But the <i>jivas</i> who enact rituals and ceremonies  not  authorized  by
the Vedic scriptures and who perform prohibited and sinful  activities  will
descend to suffer in the dark, hellish planet  without  a  doubt.  They  are
those who were born in  <i>tama  guna</i>  the  mode  of  ignorance  and  performed
degraded activities from the very beginning or may have started their  lives
situated in <i>sattva guna</i> or the  mode  of  goodness  but  later  due  to  bad
association unfortunately degraded  into  <i>raja  guna</i>  the  mode  of  passion
and <i>tama guna</i> and performed depraved activities. Others  perform  activities
not in harmony with their natures and after some time they  fall  back  into
their old habits. Performance of activities in harmony  with  one's  natural
attributes and nature gives the best results. Performing activities  not  in
accordance with one's natural attributes and contrary to one's nature  gives
inferior results. That which gives the best results should be understood  as
being the natural attributes  of  a  <i>jiva</i>  and  this  will  reflect  in  the
inherent attributes one possesses.
