Lord Krishna is explaining the defects due to the absence  of  happiness  as
referred to in this verse. Without being happy there is  no  possibility  of
concentration of the mind. Without concentration of the mind  there  can  be
no meditation and without meditation  it  is  not  possible  to  have  inner
awakening or soul-cognition. Therefore  it  has  been  declared  that  these
things are not possible for  one  without  concentration.  Santih  or  peace
refers also to liberation. Santi, moksa or liberation and  nirvana all  have
a similar meaning denoting termination of the samsara or worldly existence.
