Unless one is deluded, they will reject all that they  see  as  nothing  but
misery. But misery in itself is a mental  projection  based  upon  angle  of
perception. It is because normally  what  is  spoken  of  as  affecting  the
physical body is considered to be separate from  the  mind  that  misery  is
merely a mental condition arising from an unwelcome reception. This  is  the
meaning Lord Krishna is conveying. The Shabda  Nirnaya  states:  Aggravation
should be known as an external phenomena having  an  external  source;  with
proper discrimination this is apparent.
