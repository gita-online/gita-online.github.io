<i>Dhyanenatmani</i> means meditation on the <i>atma</i> or the immortal  soul.  <i>Sankhyena</i>
means philosophical discrimination predicated upon knowing the form  of  the
Supreme Lord as elucidated in the Vedic scriptures. The compound word <i>karma-</i>
<i>yogena</i> denotes activities of <i>sravanam</i> hearing about, <i>kirtanan</i>  chanting  the
names of and <i>smaranam</i> reflecting on the Supreme Lord Krishna or any  of  His
incarnations  authorised  in  Veduc  scriptures.  This  is  also  considered
meditation  as  confirmed  in  the  Gaupavan  scripture  as   follows:   The
performers of actions listen to the extraordinary, sublime pastimes  of  the
Supreme Lord and relishing them, meditate upon them constantly  and  realise
Him. One who listens can comprehend. One who comprehends meditates fully  on
Him. Only beings with spiritual wisdom  can  realise  the  Supreme  Lord  by
exclusive meditation upon Him. Otherwise such realisation  is  not  possible
to achieve by anybody.
