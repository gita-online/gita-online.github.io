Here it is inferred that Lord Krishna is the  composite  total  of  all  the
demigods beginning with <i>Vayu</i> the demigod in charge of the wind  due  to  the
fact that they all  are  parts  of  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine  transcendental
opulence. <i>Va</i> symbolises strength and <i>aya</i> symbolises wisdom  which  in  their
unlimited forms are qualities  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  Since  He  is  fully
complete and resplendent within Himself  various  demigods    are  mentioned
such <i>agni</i> or fire and <i>varunah</i>  or  ocean  which  represent  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
divine transcenndental opulence. Thus they manifest in unlimited ways.
