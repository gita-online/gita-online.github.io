Collating all the  previous  recommendations  Lord  Krishna  concludes  this
chapter. <i>Dharma</i> is eternal righteousness and is infused by the Supreme  Lord
Krishna and anything pertaining to Him is also <i>dharma.</i> Reflection  upon  Him
is <i>dharma,</i> worship of Him is <i>dharma,</i> glorification of Him  is  <i>dharma.</i>  Also
study of the Vedic scriptures which originate from Him is <i>dharma. Dharma</i>  is
conducive to meditation upon  the  Supreme  Lord  which  has  the  power  to
terminate <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of birth and  death  and  therefore
<i>dharma</i> is known to be immortal. The word  <i>sraddadhanah</i>  means  endowed  with
faith. The root of <i>sraddha</i> or faith is <i>srad</i>  which  means  being  receptive.
Those who are receptive to the  revelations  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  are
<i>sraddadhanah.</i>
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Casting away  all  things  undesirable  which  do  not  lead  to  <i>bhakti</i>  or
exclusive loving devotion to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  such  a  devotee
becomes very dear to Him. Collating and applying all of the  recommendations
given in these past seven verses His  devotee  becomes  especially  dear  to
Lord Krishna. <i>Bhakti</i> is completely independent and alone is  considered  the
goal. <i>Dharma</i> is considered the means and primary path  leading  to  <i>bhakti.</i>.
That which is an instrument of <i>bhakti</i> is also a part  of  <i>bhakti.</i>  Thus  the
means <i>dharma</i> guides one to the goal of <i>bhakti.</i> Thus  the  path  of  immortal
<i>bhakti</i> can be approached by following <i>dharma.</i>
