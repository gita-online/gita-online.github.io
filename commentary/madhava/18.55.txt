Lord Krishna is referring to the powerful influence of three <i>gunas</i> or  modes
of material nature that manifests from <i>prakriti</i> or the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence which is the external potency  of  the  <i>brahman</i>
or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence.  The  <i>brahman</i>  is  the
impersonal aspect of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So in this  way  the  Supreme
Lord is the absolute power behind all actions.
