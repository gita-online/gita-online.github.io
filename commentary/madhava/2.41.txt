Listen to these words with a balanced and equipoised mind. Thus has it  been
stated. Unlimited are the various conditioned states of the mind due to  the
influence  of  uncountable  impressions  leading  to  innumerable  opinions.
Therefore Arjuna may have a doubt and enquire, how  can  he  have  faith  in
these words without any reservation.  Anticipating  this  the  Supreme  Lord
neutralises  this  query  with  this  verse.  Amongst  all  the   prescribed
recommended opinions having truthful attributes  there  is  always  singular
unity. This is the actual meaning. Propitiation of the Supreme Lord  Krishna
is performed only by very few as  only  a  very  few  actually  possess  the
quality of being singular and resolute in their commitment. Any  performance
done  by  others  is  disparate  and  irresolute  due  to  the  overwhelming
impressions  within  their  mind  giving  them  an  endless  procession   of
distracting opinions.
