The unrighteous and wicked who are of vile and evil nature can practically
never be devotees of the Supreme Lord Krishna. But if some how by chance
they receive the mercy of His devotees then by that potency they sometimes
can have a change of heart and begin to regard the Supreme Lord in a
reverential mood propitiating Him exclusively. This causes them to
accumulate much merit and as they develop and advance with this state of
consciousness they can be considered to be transformed into the noble and
saintly for being rightly resolved.
