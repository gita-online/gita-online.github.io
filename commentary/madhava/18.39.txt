The word <i>sattvam</i> in the previous verse means the living entities. Those  who
have achieved <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from  material  existence  are  not  held
captive by the three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature  and  are  like
demigods upon the Earth. Although they move freely in  the  material  worlds
they are not bound by the defects of the material worlds  just  as  Vaisnava
devotees living in a city are not bound by  the  sinful  activities  of  the
residents of the city. Among  those  situated  in  <i>tama  guna</i>  the  mode  of
ignorance, the ones most despicable are those who  obscure  the  truth  from
the rest of humanity hindering them  from  developing  and  evolving.  These
evil ones follow the path of darkness and sorcery and offer  sacrifices  and
pay homage to demons for material gains. These demons are situated  in  <i>raja</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of passion and are very powerful  in  the  material  existence
manipulating societies, religions, species, planets and even  galaxies;  but
spiritually these demons are just like retarded cripples with no  access  to
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness and subsequently higher consciousness.  Any
human who is situated in <i>sattva guna</i> is impervious to  them  and  cannot  be
influenced or obstructed by the demons nefarious delusions.
<p>
The most advanced among all humans are the Vaisnava Brahmins  who  by  their
internal potency acquired by <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to  the
Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorised incarnations  as  revealed  in
Vedic scriptures, have the ability  to  free  themselves  from  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death and can guide others to do the same.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Among the pure ones situated in <i>sattva guna</i> are those known  as  <i>paramahamsa</i>
or one completely absorbed internally in relishing  the  sublime  nectar  of
the holy names of Lord Krishna realising that He is fully present  when  His
transcendental names  are  chanted  and  sung.  <i>Parivrajacarya</i>  or  one  who
joyously travels extensively  preaching the sublime glories of Lord  Krishna
everywhere they go. <i>Bahudaka</i> or one  who  dedicates  their  life  to  making
pilgrimage exclusively to the holy places in India  where  Lord  Krishna  or
any of His authorised incarnations performed  their  pastimes.  <i>Kuticaka</i>  or
one who practices renunciation in  seclusion  continuously  reflecting  upon
the Supreme Lord and learning to depend  only  upon  the  Supreme  Lord  for
everything. These four are the divisions in the  fully  renounced  order  of
life known as <i>sannyasi</i> which can only be awarded  to  males  who  have  been
initiated as Vaisnava Brahmins in one of the four authorised <i>sampradayas</i>  or
channels of disciplic succession and none  other.  <i>Brahmacari</i>  or  those  in
celibate devotion throughout their lives. <i>Vanaprastha</i> can be male or  female
and is when husband and wife sever all physical connection and embrace  only
spiritual activities for the performance of <i>bhakti</i> to the Supreme Lord.  All
of the preceding  are  completely  celibate.  The  <i>grihasta</i>  ashram  is  not
celibate and consists of  married  householder  devotees  who  perform  some
devotion  amidst  taking  care  of  family  obligations.  These  four   main
divisions listed in descending order become decreasingly  less  situated  in
pure <i>sattva guna</i> and to the  degree  that  there  is  exposure  to  external
influences one becomes subjected to <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion.
<p>
<i>Paramahamsa's</i> are known by their  tranquillity,  self-control  and  inherent
righteousness. The demigods such as Brahma, Surya, Ganesh, etc. even  though
extremely passionate rarely exhibit any signs of passion because  even  when
engaged in passionate acts their minds are constantly in communion with  the
Supreme Lord. As far as others are concerned due to the fluctuating   nature
of their minds their actions are usually equated with <i>raja guna</i> the mode  of
passion; yet when their minds are fixed upon the lotus feet of  the  Supreme
Lord then they too can  be  considered  situated  in  <i>sattva  guna.</i>  Inquiry
into  the  eternal  principles  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  and   performing
prescribed  ritualistic  activities  are  the  special  attributes  of   the
<i>brahmacari's</i> aspiring for the ultimate truth. Assuming familial  activities,
maintaining a wife, producing children are the symptoms  of  the  <i>grihastas.</i>
Becoming detached, giving up attachment to  grown  children  and  residence
along with all conceptions of  father,  mother,  wife,  husband  and  wholly
reflecting on the Supreme Lord are the expressions of <i>vanaprasthas.</i> For  the
<i>sannyasi's</i> the absolute equanimity expressed towards all living entities  is
the symbol of their advanced development.
<p>
The Brahmins although situated firmly in <i>sattva guna</i>  may  possess  a  small
degree of <i>raja guna</i> and <i>ksatriyas</i> though anchored in <i>raja  guna</i>  could  have
some qualities of <i>sattva guna</i> such as righteousness as  was  exemplified  by
King Yudisthira of the Pandavas. <i>Vaisyas</i> are mixed with both <i>raja</i>  and  <i>tama</i>
<i>gunas</i> could have some slight amount of <i>sattva guna</i> even  <i>sudras</i>  if  exposed
to good association might be found to have a percentage  or  two  of  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna.</i> Amongst those who  are  devoted  to  the  Lord  Krishna  such  natural
distinctions are obvious as they are effulgent from within  being  empowered
by the Supreme Lord. Even those born in non-brahmin dynasties such  as  meat
eating <i>mleechas</i> and dog eating <i>candelas</i> as well  as   barbarians  and  other
outcastes if they are purified by association with  devotees  and  initiated
by a bonafide spiritual master from one of the four  authorised  <i>sampradayas</i>
then they are situated in <i>sattva guna</i> and entitled to be a  devotee  of  the
Supreme Lord. Yet those who although born in <i>Brahmin</i>  families  and  perform
prescribed Vedic activities are sceptical of the supremacy of  Lord  Krishna
over all other gods are situated or consider  other  gods  as  equal  to  or
superior to Lord Krishna are situated in <i>raja</i> and <i>tama  gunas.</i>  While  those
who do not know the supremacy of Lord Krishna and  are  indifferent  to  Him
are situated in <i>tama guna.</i> 
<p>
The  <i>pitris</i>  or  anscestors,  the  <i>gandharvas</i>  or  celestial  musicians  and
singers, the ancient ascetics and the demigods are all  situated  in  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> and influenced by the three <i>gunas</i> with each one more superior then  the
previous one. The demigods, Indra the king of the heavenly  planets,  Brahma
the secondary creator of the material existence and Shiva the destroyer  are
also situated in <i>sattva guna,</i> each progressively superior  to  the  previous
one. Effulgent amongst even  the  effulgent  is  Sri  Laksmi,  the  expanded
<i>shakti</i> or feminine energy of every incarnation of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna
simultaneously as an eternal  reality.  Such  progressive  gradation  exists
even after <i>moksa</i> is attained and everyone is  eternally  blissful.  Although
the three <i>gunas</i> being material do not exist in the spiritual  worlds.  After
<i>moksa</i> when one attains the spiritual worlds the gradation can be  determined
by how extensive the bliss is that one expresses and by the  location  where
one is exhibiting this bliss such as Vaikuntha or Svetadvipa, etc.
<p>
Among the best of <i>jivas</i> situated in <i>tama guna</i> are those who are neutral  and
indifferent to the Supreme Lord Krishna. The best of those in <i>raja guna</i>  are
those who utilise their power and wealth for  the  service  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna. Since all <i>jivas</i> possess an <i>atma</i> or  immortal  soul,  they  are
all to some degree or other connected to <i>sattva guna</i> it is  just  that  some
are more obscured then others. Some are so obscured that there is no  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> visible. All are differentiated  in  classification  according  to  the
predominance of one of the three <i>gunas.</i> Commencing with  the  attributes  of
<i>sattva  guna</i>  every  <i>jiva</i>  can  become  qualified  for  <i>moksa</i>  from   Brahma
downwards. Spiritual intelligence and  wisdom  only  manifests  from  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> that is why it is stated in the Vedic scriptures that from <i>sattva  guna</i>
arises spiritual wisdom  and  those  who  have  perfected  such  wisdom  are
candidates for redemption and  achieve  <i>moksa</i>  and  those  who  have  failed
descend in darkness  to  lower  existences  while  those  who  have  neither
perfected or failed remain suspended in <i>samsara</i> for another lifetime.
