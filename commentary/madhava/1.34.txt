<i><u>Madhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusana's.</u></i>

When there is a resultant intermixture of castes due to the  destruction  of
the family structure; those who are responsible are damned to hell; but  not
only these ruinous family members. Their forefathers are also sent  to  hell
as well due to the cessation of the ritual offerings of food and water  that
are no longer given due to the fact that there  no  longer  exist  any  male
descendants to perform such rites.
