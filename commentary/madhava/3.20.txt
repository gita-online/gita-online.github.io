For  further  emphasis  to  the  previous  verse  Lord  Krishna  now   gives
historical references of  men of actions who  attained <i>atma-tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation while performing actions. It  also  infers  that  by  performing
prescribed actions of the Vedic  scriptures  in  an  unattached  manner  one
gains wisdom. It should not be assumed that  actions  alone  are  sufficient
without possessing wisdom. King Janaka was reknown  throughout  <i>Bharata</i>  now
known as India as a king of great wisdom.  He  and  others  were  very  well
established in spiritual intelligence.

Even in other instances there exists no disparity for  the  path  of   <i>atma-</i>
<i>tattva.</i> Wherever it has been stated that for  liberation  visits  to  sacred
rivers and holy tirthas or by leaving one' body in Prayag or by taking  bath
at Kuruksetra during the solar eclipse. When these places  are  praised  the
liberation referred to is solely  for  the  absolution  of  one's  sins  and
demerits only. Because whenever any of these  famous  places  are  mentioned
then <i>atma-tattva</i> must be mentioned as well because it is the  primary  basis
for liberation. Without <i>atma-tattva</i> the state of <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
the cycle of birth and death is not  possible.  Liberation  in  places  like
Prayag is recommended because  a  holy  place  can  greatly  assist  one  in
achieving the ultimate attainment; but still  the  foundation  of  spiritual
wisdom is essential. So the statements eulogising the Ganges and other  holy
rivers and places are not in any way contradictory to the  reality  required
of achieving <i>atma-tattva</i> for the attainment of <i>moksa.</i> This  information  has
also been confirmed by Vedavyasa in the Narada Purana where  it  is  written
that visits to sacred rivers and holy places for the performance of  rituals
is for  the  simple  minded  people  and  also  to  attract  those  who  are
bewildered; but liberation is possible only by realising  the  Supreme  Lord
as <i>Paramatma</i> the supersoul within and  not  otherwise,  there  is  no  other
path. Therefore <i>atma-tattva</i> or soul realisation is the only  path  to  <i>moksa</i>
and there is no other way possible.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
King Janaka  and  other  great  men  renowned  for  their  wisdom  performed
countless  prescribed Vedic activities according to their status in  society
yet still reached perfection in <i>atma-tattva</i>  and  attained  <i>moksa</i>  in  their
lives. Even after attaining <i>moksa</i> they performed Vedic  activities  for  the
benefit and welfare of the world and  to  inspire  others  to  also  perform
prescribed Vedic actions for the balance and maintenance of the  world.  For
one who is not a  person  of  wisdom  such  activities  performed  leads  to
purification and for one who is a person of wisdom such activities  lead  to
the bliss of pleasing the Supreme Lord and the fulfilment of  the  bliss  of
<i>moksa.</i>
