So the manner in which <i>karma yoga</i> or  prescribed  Vedic  activities  without
desire is being explained by Lord Krishna. The Supreme Lord  is  present  as
<i>paramatma</i> or the omnipresent soul in all  naturally  conceived  beings.  One
who attains perception  of  the  Supreme  Being  within  becomes  aware  the
Supreme Being's presence in all beings and thus becomes dear to all  beings.
This is emphasised by the words <i>sarva bhutama</i> which means  all  beings  love
such a person as they love themselves.

Now begins the summation.

Considering the Supreme Lord Krishna as the indwelling consciousness  within
the heart of all beings is the primary form of equanimity and  knowing  that
all beings are under His control is knowing Him as  the  Supreme  Being.  In
the Agni Purana it states: That one  who  knows  the  Supreme  Lord  is  the
indwelling consciousness within all beings has the understanding that He  is
the all pervading Lord of all beings.
