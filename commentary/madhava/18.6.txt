The different classes of prescribed Vedic  activities  are  delineated.  The
types  of  <i>yagna</i>  or  ritualistic  propitiation  and   worship,   <i>tapah</i>   or
austerities and <i>danam</i> or  charity  have  been  classified  in  the  previous
chapter according to the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature.  Yet  here
Lord Krishna emphasises that all these  activities  should  be  forthrightly
performed and never given up because such  activities  are  sanctifying  and
purifying. Only the  desire  for  rewards  for  such  activities  should  be
abandoned and not the activity itself. If this  were  not  true  then  there
would be contradiction  with  the  hallowed  revelations  of  Vedavyasa  who
stated that: An aspirant whether a married householder, a forest dweller  or
mountain recluse who is striving  for  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence must perform  prescribed  Vedic  activities  for  their  own  best
welfare and interests. <i>Yagna</i> is the form of acquired wisdom,  <i>tapah</i>  is  the
form of acquired faith and <i>danam</i> is the form of  acquired  fearlessness.  So
they all should be  always  performed.  The  purport  is  that  no  one  can
permanently avoid activity it is not possible, but everyone can give up  the
desire for rewards from activities and that is actual renunciation.

Now begins the summary.
<p>
One should sincerely offer charity to the Vaisnavas and  Brahmins  according
to one's capacity. One should  sincerely  instruct  spiritual  knowledge  to
supplicants to the best of one's ability and  one  should  perform  personal
austerities according to one's <i>varnasrama</i> or class  and  stage  in  life.  A
<i>grihasta</i> or householder of the <i>vaisya</i> or mercantile class  has  a  different
parameter for austerities then a <i>brahmacari</i> or celibate student of  Vaisnava
brahmanas  or  ordained  spiritual  order  and  their  activities  are  very
different.  A  <i>ksatriya</i>  from  the  royal  or  warrior  class  may   perform
exceedingly  extreme  austerities  such  as  fasting  in  desert   heat   or
meditating  in  intense  cold  that  would  not  appeal  to  a  <i>grihasta</i>  or
<i>brahmacari</i>. Even a lowly <i>sudra</i> of the worker  class  may  advance  by  doing
some penance such as fasting and by  speaking  truthfully  and  serving  the
other three orders faithfully. Although one is born  in  various  situations
in life the true quality of a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being is inherent within  and
this is what determines one's actual character in life. This theme  will  be
examined more by Madhvacarya's comments on verses 47 and 48.
