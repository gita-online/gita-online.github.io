Vedic knowledge alone destroys spiritual ignorance that is why Lord  Krishna
uses the word <i>jnana</i> or knowledge referring to knowledge of the  Vedas  which
gives actual awareness of the ultimate reality. Here the word <i>jnana</i>  denotes
a supra-consciousness experience it does not mean expertise in  intellectual
empirical knowledge nor does  it  mean  proficiency  in  mundane  analytical
knowledge.
