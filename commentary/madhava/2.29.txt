The eternal soul being a infinitesimal portion of the Supreme Lord is  never
destroyed even during  the repetitious  connection  and  disconnection  with
the physical body. As this is all in accordance with cosmic order  there  is
certainly no reason to lament for this. The omnipotence of the Supreme  Lord
is amazing. Another meaning can be it is very rare. Therefore it is  amazing
when known. The eternal soul being an infinitesimal portion of  the  Supreme
Lord is also amazing and the  living  entity  who  is  aware  of  their  own
eternal soul is also very rare.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
What is there to be amazed at for the Supreme Lord to say:  It  is  amazing?
Verily what is amazing  is  the  existence  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself.
Therefore the spiritually intelligent see the eternal soul as  a  marvellous
expansion of the Supreme Lord and  upon  realisation  of  this  reality  are
amazed. Like when the eye sees the expansive sky as being the  form  of  the
sky or perceives the expanse of the ocean as being the form of the ocean.
<p>
In the Brahma Tarka it is stated thus:
<p>
Amazing indeed is the Supreme Lord and it is not possible to find any  other
comparable to Him. Therefore wisdom about Him is very similar to  perceiving
Him.
<p>
Not being amazed by the Supreme Lord which exists in some is  a  symptom  of
those who are spiritually unintelligent.  This  is  indicated  by  the  word
kascit meaning some.
