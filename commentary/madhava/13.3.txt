What the <i>yad viktri</i> of the <i>ksetra</i> means what are its transformations and  by
what modifications is it affected. <i>Yatas ca yat</i> means  by  Him  the  Supreme
Lord the <i>ksetra</i> has  originated and that it is He alone  who  energized  it.
The words <i>sa ca ya</i> specifies the Supreme Lord also and indicates His form.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The words <i>yatas ca yat</i> indicates that solely by the energy  of  the  Supreme
Lord all creation is energized. He is  the  sole  energizer.  <i>Prerana</i>  means
having similarity in thoughts. Sometimes  even  dialogue  is  called  <i>samvad</i>
similar talk. Since Lord Krishna energizes all creation  He  also  energizes
the thoughts of all and sometimes such thoughts manifest which  are  similar
to His own. This is natural. So He is known as <i>anusarini</i>  or  <i>anusmanta</i>  the
ordainer of thoughts which have divine origins in Him. The <i>ksetrajna</i> is  the
<i>atma</i> or eternal soul and is <i>upadrishta</i> or  the  witness  with  supra-natural
connecting abilities for thoughts and things divine which emanate  from  the
Supreme Lord and induces this in those  who  seek  self-realisation  of  the
<i>atma</i> and attainment of the ultimate consciousness. Lord Krishna infers  that
this can be known is by its effect.
