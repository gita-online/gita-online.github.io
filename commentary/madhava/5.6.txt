Lord Krishna is reconfirming that renunciation is advisable  for  equanimity
of mind for without it the possibility  of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  the
cycle of birth and death in the material existence will  not  manifest.  The
desire for sense objects and  the  motivation  for  rewards  only  leads  to
misery. <i>Moksa</i> itself is should be the goal of all endeavours  as  all  other
goals are of little importance as they are material and  transitory  and  in
one's possession for only a limited time.  The  Padma  Purana  states:  That
except for the goal of  <i>moksa</i>  all  other  goals  are  not  even  worthy  of
consideration. When an effort  is  able  to  bestow  superior  results,  the
bestowal of inferior results is of no consequence.  The  primary  effect  of
equanimity is renunciation thus the word <i>munir</i> is given meaning one who  has
renounced. Thus it is said that they alone are known as renunciates who  are
devoid of desire and anger.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
The means of <i>moksa</i> or liberation is said to be the state of  equanimity  and
its effect is renunciation. That which is always first offered to the  lotus
feet of the Supreme Lord for His pleasure is true renunciation and no  other
forms of renunciation are commendable. In the Agni Purana  is  stated:  That
without renouncing the desire of rewards  for  one's  actions  whatever  one
might offer unto the Supreme Lord has no  merit  and  the  rewards  received
from all forms of renunciation contrary for the satisfaction of the  Supreme
Lord are  similar to the pleasures of hell. Hence it has been declared  what
is called renunciation know that to  be  equanimity.  Since  equanimity  has
been clarified to be of such  paramount  importance  there  is  no  need  to
emphasise it further.
