Now Lord Krishna is clarifying His position by  stating  that  there  is  no
performance of any prescribed Vedic action required of Him;  yet  and  still
He performs actions for the benefit of the world. So in the same way  Arjuna
should perform prescribed actions for maintaining world order  and  offering
the results of the actions to the Supreme Lord. This has  been  revealed  in
the Krishna Samhita. By sustenance, by maintenance and  by  destruction  the
Supreme Lord has nothing to  gain.  Without  any  objective  whatsoever  the
Supreme Lord Krishna according to His creative impulse performs all  actions
perpetually throughout all of creation. Just as a person  who  is  extremely
happy may spontaneously sing and dance to express their special pleasure  in
the  same  way  the  Supreme  Lord  performs  all  actions  to  express  His
consciousness which is perpetually in a state of Supreme Bliss.
