The previous verse 47 is further clarified here.  Yoga,  equanimity  is  the
methodology encouraged. Relinquishing desire and attachment to  the  rewards
of actions while steadfastly  remaining  equipoised  in  either  success  or
failure. This verily is what is meant by equanimity.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The meaning of the word  sangam  is  attachment.  Attachment  to  what?  The
rewards of one's fruitive actions.
