Brahma, Shiva, demi-gods such as Indra, Surya,  Agni,  Vayu  and  all  other
<i>jivas</i> or embodied beings are <i>ksarah</i> or perishable.  Everything  that  arises
from <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum  pervading  physical  existence  is
impermanent and subject to destruction.  Everything  that  arises  from  the
<i>brahman</i> or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence  is  <i>aksarah</i>  or
imperishable and of an eternal nature. This includes all <i>atma's</i> or  immortal
souls. But the Supreme Lord  Krishna  along  with  all  of  His  <i>avatars</i>  or
incarnations  and  expansions  as  revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures  are  all
transcendental and distinctly different to both the <i>ksarah</i> or  <i>aksarah.</i>  The
word <i>kuta-sthah</i> spoken earlier in verse 16 means the eternal  associates  of
the Supreme Lord such as Sri Laxsmi-devi, who is also of an  eternal  nature
as the <i>shakti</i> or feminine potency of  the  Supreme  Lord  always  in  direct
service of Lord Krishna who is known as <i>Purusottama</i> the Supreme Being.
