The word <i>manisinah</i> refers to the  scholars  of  the  <i>sankhya</i>  or  analytical
school of thought who propound  that  renunciation  is  the  abandonment  of
unrighteous actions due to possessing defects such as promoting  desires  or
instigating violence. While others denoted by the words  <i>apare  ca</i>  maintain
the understanding that only the abandonment of the  desire  for  rewards  is
renunciation. Both opinions have  relevance  and  both  opinions  have  been
accepted as reasonable.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
Having referred to them as <i>manisinah</i>  it  is  not  appropriate  to  minimise
their views but if inferior they should  be  given  up.  Thus  a  breach  of
etiquette is averted. The purport is to abandon  actions  with  desires  for
rewards and all attachment to them. In the next  verse  Lord  Krishna  gives
His absolute conclusion on this subject.
