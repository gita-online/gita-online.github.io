The word <i>kalo</i> means time and includes containing and terminating as well  as
the embodiment of  eternal  wisdom  and  the  perennial  principles  of  the
resplendent Supreme Lord Krishna. The word <i>kalo</i> has as  its  root  the  word
<i>kala</i> which is described as container, a binder,  an  integrator,  as  wisdom
and as a provider of all desires. This same word is  utilised  to  refer  to
the  Supreme  Lord.  In  the  <i>Moksa  Dharma</i>  or  Mahabharata  there   is   a
conversation between Bali Maharaja and Indra as follows:  O  Indra  you  are
praising yourself before one who is bound by the shackles of time  which  is
verily the power of the Supreme Lord Krishna who is of  dark,  lustrous  hue
and who binds the beings of this world and once having  bound  them  directs
their coming and goings by  His  intrepid  potency  of  time.  The  Bhagavat
Purana states: Lord Krishna synonymous with time  draws  the  minds  of  all
beings to Himself. The word <i>pravriddho</i> meaning  great  denotes  completeness
in its entirety since the beginning. The Bhagavat Purana  states:  From  the
Supreme Lord Himself the eternal cosmic truth manifested  and  this  is  the
great eternal event from ancient antiquity. <i>Pra</i> in <i>pravriddho</i> refers to  the
Supreme Lord and propitiation to Him  is  eulogising  His  holy  names.  The
Bhagavat Purana states that the Supreme Lord is never born nor does He  ever
die.  Neither is He subject to growing up or any other modifications  as  He
is complete in all respects. The Moksa Dharma states: The <i>rupa</i>  or  form  of
the Supreme Lord is completely transcendental and divine, never  subject  to
dimunition and expansion. If the Supreme  Lord  is  never  modified  by  the
performance of any action how can there possibly be on His  part  any  self-
endeavour? The Supreme Lord is capable without any effort, in a blink of  an
eye of <i>loka-ksaya-krt</i> or destruction of all the  worlds.  The  word  <i>api</i>  is
used to convey the message that accept  for  Arjuna's  brothers  and  a  few
others  all  the  warriors   of  the  Kauravas  and  the  Pandavas  will  be
annihilated by each other. The word <i>pratyanikesu</i> means the  opposing  armies
on both sides and that is why it is spoken in the plural sense.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The Varaha Purana states: Since  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  inherently
endowed with complete attributes fully able to destroy all  the  worlds  and
because He is the creator, knower and controller of  all,  He  is  known  as
<i>kala</i>. By use of the word <i>api</i> Arjuna is assured that He and  the  other  four
Pandavas are excluded from the annihilation of both armies.
