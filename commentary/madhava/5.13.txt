Although the word <i>prabhu</i> may be used in  addressing  elevated  personalities
who are superior to all others. Here Lord Krishna is using it  to  mean  the
Supreme Lord declaring He is not  responsible  for  the  actions  of  living
entities. The word <i>loka</i> means world and <i>lokasya</i> is refering  to  the  people
of the world.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Even as the mandate for regency  bequeathed  by  a  king  upon  his  son  is
limited; even so is the independence to  perform  actions  bestowed  by  the
Supreme Lord upon human beings limited as well. To  dispel  the  doubt  that
human beings  might  be  independent  in  their  actions  and  consequential
reactions regarding the righteous or unrighteous merits or demerits of  such
actions this verse is responding to. The answer is  the  Supreme  lord  does
not inaugurate independence of action or initiate the consequential  results
of actions for any being.  Otherwise  it  would  have  been  unnecessary  to
include the word <i>lokasya</i> to denote people of the world. Even though the  son
of the king is ruling over a  province  of  the  kingdom  and  enjoying  the
fruits  having  limited  independence  from  the  king  but  he   is   still
responsible for his actions and rulership.  In  the  same  way  the  actions
performed by the embodied being and the resulting reactions are  not  caused
by the dependence upon the Supreme Lord but by  the  results  of  one's  own
activities. When a person believes they are the performer  of  actions  they
take on the responsibility of determining their destiny independent  of  the
Supreme Lord and  thus  has  to  accept  responsibility  for  suffering  the
consequences.
<p>
The Supreme Lord as  the  energising  source  of  all  creation  impels  all
beings. This means He impels them by their <i>svabhavas</i> or  natural  propensity
as given in the <i>sloka</i> or verse. All the impulses of the  all  living  beings
is induced and activated by the Supreme Lord by His internal  potency.  Only
the Supreme Lord is independent. Everything  else  is  dependent  upon  Him.
Being completely independent within Himself and transcendental  to  <i>prakriti</i>
or material nature, He has no connection with dualities or the  three  modes
<i>prakriti</i> or the merits and demerits associated with actions.  The  intellect
of humans being enveloped in ignorance since time immemorial  is  not  aware
of these eternal truths as given in the Varaha Purana.
<p>
The Supreme Lord Krishna is the Lord of all by His natural  propensity  thus
He is known as <i>svabhava</i>. He creates the  heat  of  the  sun  and  seeds  the
clouds with water causing rains and also stops the rain  by  His  will.  The
power and majesty of the Supreme Lord is described in innumerable ways.  His
intrinsic qualities  and  attributes  such  as  all  power,  all  knowledge,
renunciation and beauty. The ancient adage that without the sanction of  the
Supreme Lord not a leaf may fall nor a blade of grass grow  is  factual  and
all due to the potency of His intrinsic qualities and  attributes.  Creation
is  but  His  natural  propensities  manifesting  with  effusive   activity.
Statements in the Vedic scriptures like the above reveal  nothing  which  is
not His natural propensity nor His active or  non-active  attributes  so  no
contradiction.
<p>
The inability to adequately describe the activities of the Supreme Lord  has
been explained already in the second chapter  so  it  is  not  necessary  to
repeat it again. In the absence of the special attributes of the <i>Brahman</i>  or
spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence,  other  actions  which  are
transcendental to material nature are not applicable to Him  and  thus  need
not to be attributed to  Him  although  this  reality  is  contrary  to  the
erroneous, intemperate speculations of the <i>sunyavadis</i> or nihilists  it  need
not be rebutted. The  mere  statement  that  the  <i>sunyvadis</i>  give  that  the
Supreme Lord is without any special attributes or  the  statement  that  the
<i>mayavadis</i> give that the Supreme Lord possess no  attributes  both  establish
the reality of His existence. The ability to communicate with  every  living
being internally, the utility of the divine  sound  OM  His  personal  sound
manifestation that pervades all creation along with His effulgence known  as
the <i>Brahman</i> are all manifestations of His  special  attributes  establishing
the reality of His existence. Otherwise such attributes  would  have  to  be
understood by supporting proofs and that would be defective in  knowing  Him
and  this  is  not  the  case.  The  Supreme  Lord  has  the  attribute   of
inconceivability. If this attribute of inconceivability is to be  understood
by the exclusion of His special attributes then such  inconceivability  must
also be an attribute of His existence, otherwise  any  attempts  to  further
comprehend His attributes will be defective. The word <i>sarva</i> meaning all  and
other descriptions  do  not  categorically  establish  the  reality  of  the
Supreme Lord's existence nor can all the  evidences  and  proofs  that  have
already been established prove His supremacy and existence.  His  attributes
like the seven types of essence are perpetually established even  when  they
are not perceivable. By His self-effulgence  manifested  into  the  <i>Brahman,</i>
His existence is not easily established either; but His  self-effulgence  is
specially accepted as an established fact due to it  not  being  illuminated
by any external source. The possessor  of  action  and  the  performance  of
action are not contradictory by normal  experience  and  knowledge  and  the
object of knowledge cannot be experienced without the knower  of  knowledge.
Therefore the erroneous hypothesis of the uninformed speculators  does  have
any significance.
<p>
The Supreme Lord Krishna is the sole performer of  all  actions,  everything
is under His control and subservient to Him. In the Paingi Scripture  states
that nothing can be accomplished without the  Supreme  Lord  initiating  the
action.
