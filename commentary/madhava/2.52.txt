Lord Krishna further clarifies the same point in this  verse  as  well.  The
intellect that was confused by contradictory arguments in the Vedas  becomes
perfectly stabilised  by  the  proper  interpretation  of  the  Vedas.  Then
equanimity of the mind becomes unshakeable like the  resonance  of  a  drum.
Then with intense meditation on the bliss of the supreme  one  shall  attain
communion with the ultimate truth within and succeed in all one's efforts.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
The word nirvedam indicates detachment. When delusion is  forsaken  and  all
other signs of nescience and non-awareness disappears then  detachment  from
the mundane arises and a living entity acquires the beneficial  result  from
listening to the Vedas from a self-realised being.  Thereafter  adhering  to
the path established by the Vedas in mind and in conduct  the  uncompromised
meaning derived thereof is  apparent  delivering  with  it  an  unimaginable
experience of spiritual satisfaction. Thus communion with Lord Krishna  will
be attained through liberation  by  equanimity  of  the  mind  developed  in
wisdom by  spiritual  intelligence.  Sruti  vipraptipanna  means  not  being
influenced to act fruitively by the rewards given in the Vedic scriptures.
