Lord Krishna is giving the indications of transcendent  meditation  in  this
verse. That which is confidential and difficult of realising is the  eternal
soul which is verily the form of the  Supreme  Lord  which  to  one  who  is
asleep is vague and unclear. But those who have their senses  under  control
are aware and awake and experience everything through the perception of  the
realised soul. This is the meaning  Lord  Krishna  is  conveying.  To  those
beings whose enthusiasm for the senses is  awake  for  them  as  a  sleeping
person recognises nothing around them, cognition of  the  soul  is  unknown.
Like one who is crazy can be seen by the way they  are  walking.  So  it  is
understood that the body is verily not ours. One who meditates is  known  as
a muni and the word pasyatah indicates one who perceives.

Now begins the summation.
<p>
All with spiritual intelligence cannot  perceive  the  ultimate  truth  with
clarity. One may perceive the ultimate truth during the night  while  others
may not perceive the ultimate truth. The latter are the ones  bewildered  by
the material energy. They see nothing except what they can  experience  with
their senses. This is due to being captivated by their senses and unable  to
concentrate  their  mind  in  meditation.   But  like  the  sun  shining  is
perceived by everyone internally all is perceived as well but  the  external
consciousness is oblivious to it focused on the enjoyment of sense  objects.
Yet and still some advanced living entities are able to fathom it. This  has
been mentioned in the Brahma Taraka.
