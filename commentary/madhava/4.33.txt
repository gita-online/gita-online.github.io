Every activity recommended in the preceding verses are useful methods of
upasana or engaging oneself in glorifying the Supreme Lord. Spiritual
knowledge is the result of this.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Everything is verily performance of actions but by itself it amounts to
very little. The culmination of Vedic actions is spiritual knowledge and
solely in spiritual realisation do actions find fulfilment. In the Mundaka
Upanisad it states: That acts of yagna or offerings of worship are
undoubtedly meritorious in themselves; but superior to them is spiritual
knowledge where all doubts are dispelled and the need for all actions
terminated. The point Lord Krishna is making is that all actions culminate
in knowledge.
