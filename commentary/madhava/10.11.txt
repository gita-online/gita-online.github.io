The <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence  is  entirely
complete within itself. This is why the Supreme Lord is called <i>param  brahma</i>
or the Supreme <i>Brahma</i> because He is even more  superior.  Since  it  assumes
unlimited forms it is known as omni-present. The Varuna Purana  states:  All
pervading, the energiser, the first before  all,  the  Supreme  Lord  verily
expands Himself as unlimitedly and by His will He becomes the many.
