The word <i>sarvan</i> means all desires in every sphere  of  endeavour.  The  word
<i>asesatah</i> means complete cessation of all desires. The word  <i>manasaiva</i>  means
by the sole strength of the  mind  only  is  restraint  possible.  Spiritual
intelligence  is  the  instrument  for  restraining  the  mind  as  well  as
restraining the sense. This is what Lord Krishna is indicating.
