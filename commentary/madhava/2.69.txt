The way in which those situated in transcendent  meditation  experience  the
objects of the senses is explained in this verse by Lord  Krishna.   Whoever
remains unaffected by sense objects even  when  they  approach  incessantly,
who is not overwhelmed by them, who does not endeavour for them, who is  not
at a loss due to their absence, who is unchanged like the ocean  which  does
not increase no matter how many bodies of water enter it and which does  not
decrease if no other bodies of water  enter  it  endeavouring  for  neither.
Such a one as this can attain peace. This is the meaning.
<p>
Now begins the summation.
<p>
Even while experiencing interaction  with  the  senses,  one  who  does  not
transgress  the  boundaries  of   desire,  like  the  ocean  which   remains
steadfast within its boundaries destined by creation, then  such  a  one  is
not bound by theses desires. One is then liberated from  these  desires.  Ka
means to become selfish. Hence one whose desires are self-centered is  known
to be the selfish one.  All desires are not contrary to liberation  nor  are
all desires opposed to liberation. In the  absence  of  desires  it  is  not
possible to live a normal life.  Since attaining peace from endless  desires
is liberation itself, subsequently develops eternal  faith  in  the  Supreme
Lord. Verily this is truth.
