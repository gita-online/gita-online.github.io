Hari OM! The nature of what is known as freedom or  bondage  in  <i>samsara</i>  or
the perpetual cycle of birth and death is  delineated  in  this  chapter  by
Lord Krishna. The word <i>urdhva</i> means above as in  superior  to.  The  Supreme
Lord is the  superior  quality  abiding  in  all  virtues.  He  is  superior
principle   residing  within  the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul.  <i>Urdhva</i>   means
paramount in all respects. The word <i>andhah</i> means below and is base,  mundane
and even vile. The branches refer to the <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings  who  are
subjected to transmigration in <i>samsara</i> and they include  the  demigods  also
headed by Brahma who lives for billions of years. Although  <i>asvattha</i>  refers
to a banyan tree another meaning  is   everlasting  in  the  sense  that  it
exists in a continuous  stream  without  changing  even  though  innumerable
myriads of <i>jivas</i> are coming and going  incessantly.  But  their  coming  and
going does not change its nature. Whatever form and function it had  in  the
beginning of creation that form and function  it  will  have  at  all  times
throughout creation.  So  that  is  why  it  is  known  as  everlasting  and
indestructible. The word <i>chamdamsi</i> refers to the leaves of  the  tree  which
are the aphorisms of the Vedic scriptures which  propunds  what  actions  in
life are to be performed and what activities are to  be  performed  and  the
results of violating or adhering to the  Vedic  injunctions  determines  the
<i>karma</i> or reactions to actions that one will have to  experience  in  joy  or
misery. These reactions are like the fruits of a tree which can  never  come
about without the leaves.

Now begins the summation.

Hari! Hari OM! What was briefly mentioned in chapter 13  is  now  elaborated
upon by Lord Krishna with further clarification. The roots being  distinctly
above refer to the Supreme Lord as the universal  tree  even  as  the  Earth
representing  <i>prakriti</i>    or  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence is the  reflection  of  this  tree.  Attributes  of  consciousness
represent the  primary  roots  while  non-consciousness  are  the  secondary
roots. Here the Vedic association of consciousness  and  unconsciousness  as
being similar to  a  tree  is  well  known.  The  Earth  like  the  demigods
activates the conscious and the Supreme Lord becomes the stable and  eternal
root. The unconscious who are base and vile are put in bondage  by  a  great
sense of false ego get  attracted  by  their  senses  and  attached  to  the
elements. The <i>chamdamsi</i> or leaves are the <i>karma</i>  due  to  activity  and  the
fruits are desires such as name, fame, wealth and <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from
material existence.  Another meaning of <i>chamdamsi</i> is  to  unseal.  Thus  the
words of the Vedic scriptures are called <i>chandas</i> or that which  unseals  the
esoteric meaning of the eternal wisdom of the Vedas.
