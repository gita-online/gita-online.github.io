Lord Krishna confirms in this verse that those devotees who  are  versed  in
<i>karma yoga</i> or facilitating communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  by  actions<i>,</i>
<i>bhakti yoga</i> or facilitating communion with the  Supreme  Lord  by  exclusive
loving devotion, <i>jnana yoga</i> or facilitating communion with the Supreme  Lord
by knowledge and  those  who  although  not  so  expert  have  anyway  fully
surrendered to Him are on the same platform there is no  difference  if  all
ordained actions are offered with a feeling  of  surrender  solely  to  Him.
Such consciousness will also  cause  a  modification  in  the  cessation  of
random thought waves that arise uninvited. The equanimity of  the  intellect
means control of the mind and snses.
