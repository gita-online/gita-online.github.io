Both invariably lead to the same result because due  to  performing  actions
with spiritual intelligence one achieves the same goal  of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul. Therefore even renunciates  with  spiritual  wisdom
should perform prescribed Vedic activities  and  <i>grihastas</i>  or  householders
should  cultivate  knowledge  of  the  resplendent  Supreme  Lord.   Without
spiritual intelligence one's actions  can  never  be  properly  established.
Whereas performance of activities in spiritual intelligence  without  desire
of rewards automatically leads one to renunciation. The person who  performs
actions with renunciation offering the results to the Supreme  Lord  attains
the eternal <i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence.
This blessed person should propitiate the <i>Brahman</i> in its more  advanced  and
personal <i>avatar</i> manifestaion or incarnations such  as  Rama  or  Buddha  and
expansions such as Vishnu or Vasudeva;  both categories which  emanate  from
the Supreme Lord  Krishna.  The  renunciate  should  offer  propitiation  by
<i>manasa</i> or mentally offering flowers and meditating on  the  <i>pranava</i>  or  the
primordial mantra OM. <i>Moksa</i> or liberation is assured  for  the  desire  free
performers of prescribed  Vedic  activities,  those  firmly  established  in
renunciation and those cognisant of the  eternal  <i>Brahman.</i>  But  even  among
these there is more bliss and satisfaction for those who perform actions  to
please the Supreme Lord Krishna  or  any  of  His  Vedic  authorised  <i>avatar</i>
incarnations and expansions.  Performance  of  prescribed  Vedic  activities
without knowledge of Lord Krishna  and  His   <i>avatars</i>  is  not  laudable  or
commendable. Therefore only those actions performed in knowledge of Him  are
known  to  be  actions  performed  in  renunciation.  Such  actions  as  are
performed by renunciates is called  <i>karma</i>  or  actions  based  on  spiritual
intelligence. <i>Kar</i> is understood as action and <i>ma</i> is  understood  as  wisdom.
Thus even  the  <i>grihastas</i>  or  householders  with  wives  and  children  and
responsibility can also perform actions  in  renunciation  if  they  possess
this wisdom or spiritual intelligence. Thus there is no  difference  between
renunciation and <i>karma yoga</i> or performing prescribed  Vedic  activities,  if
the actions are performed as a  matter  of  duty  with  no  desire  for  the
rewards of the action. In the Vyasa Smriti it states  that  the  distinction
between a <i>grihasta</i> following <i>karma  yoga</i>  without  desires  and  an  ascetic
renunciate without desire except for the regulations and constraints on  the
activities accepted by each.
