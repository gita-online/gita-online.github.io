Now Lord Krishna reveals the results of perceiving Him everywhere. For  such
a person He is never lost nor is such a person  ever  lost  to  Him  meaning
such a person ever remains devoted to Him.  It  is  indeed  the  master  who
protects the servant and it is certain that it is the Supreme Lord only  who
protects all the living entities. But it is also  well  known  that  if  the
master is not offered proper respect by the servant or fails to be  obedient
then the master ceases to be the master. In the Garuda Purana it is  stated:
One who always perceives the Supreme Lord equally  within  all  beings  will
always possess unshakeable devotion and for such a person the  Supreme  Lord
Himself will personally maintain them.
