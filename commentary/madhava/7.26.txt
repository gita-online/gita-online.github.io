Lord Krishna explains that for Him there is  never  any  illusion;  but  the
embodied beings without His grace emanating through the  bonafide  spiritual
master in  authorised  disciplic  succession  will  find  it  impossible  to
extricate themselves from <i>maya</i> or  illusory  impressions  superimposed  upon
the mind. It should be clearly understood that no one can know Lord  Krishna
by their own efforts regardless how great. He  is  only  known  by  His  own
desire.

Now begins the summation.

As much as Lord Krishna is known to Himself none other can know Him.  <i>Brahma</i>
the  demigod  responsible  for  material  creation  and  <i>Shiva</i>  the  demigod
responsible for material destruction, by His grace  know  Him  partially  to
some extent according to their ability and  gradation.  The  Katha  Upanisad
I.II.XXIII is categorical in its declaration that: The Supreme  Lord  cannot
be attained by instruction or by intelligence or even  by  constant  hearing
about. Whom the Supreme Lord Himself chooses, only is  able  to  attain  Him
and none other. Only to the one He chooses doe  He  reveal  His  <i>rupa</i>  form,
<i>guna</i> or qualities and <i>lila</i> His phenomenal pastimes.
