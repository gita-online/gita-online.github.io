The Supreme Lord Krishna exists  in  all  places.  This  means  that  He  is
omnipresent everywhere in a unified manner and it also means that He  exists
in special forms authorised in the Vedic scriptures that have  extraordinary
attributes and phenomenal qualities. In the Sanat Sujati it  is  stated:  In
the four <i>yugas</i> or ages He is of whitish hue, reddish hue, blackish  hue  and
golden hue.  So  the  Supreme  divinity  may  be  perceived  extensively  in
unlimited ways at all times as the one as the  many  and  His  own  personal
distinct forms as well.
