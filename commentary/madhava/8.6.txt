Lord Krishna states <i>smaran bhavam tyajaty ante kalevaram</i> meaning leaves  the
body at the final moment remembering. To insure that there is  no  confusion
or contradiction in the minds of the ignorant, the  adjective  <i>ante</i>  meaning
at the final moment is spoken. It is not that the  Supreme  Lord  should  be
meditated on only at the moment of death.  To  the  contrary  He  should  be
remembered,  recollected  and  contemplated  upon  at  every   moment.   The
spiritually developed have no such confusion as  their  remembrance  of  the
Supreme Lord is the focal point of their lives and constant. To  think  that
such remembrance is to be  utilized only as a one time  proposition  at  the
moment of death is an unwise consideration.

The Skanda Purana states that: There is no doubt that at the time  of  death
it is not easy to remember the Supreme  Lord  due  to  the  difficulties  of
dying. At the time of departure from  the body one must be  attuned  to  the
inner nature. The word <i>bhava</i>  means  internal  consciousness.  The  internal
consciousness is that which abides internally thus it  is  said  it  is  the
nature which abides within. Only if one contemplates something  continuously
does it become fixed as internal consciousness and manifest  as  a  part  of
one's nature. Otherwise what one will think at the moment of death  will  be
mere  ego  related  ideas  derived  from   one's   own   mundane   empirical
experiences.
