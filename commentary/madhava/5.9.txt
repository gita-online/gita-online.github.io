Whosoever is properly situated in the state of equanimity  is  not  affected
by reactions due  to  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  the  prescribed  Vedic  actions  they
perform. This means one does not desire the rewards  of  their  actions  but
instead dutifully offers the results of all their actions unto  the  Supreme
Lord.  For  the  purpose  of  emphasising  the  method  of  performing  this
spiritual  practice  and  for  the  sake  of  removing  any  impression   of
casualness the subject  of  renouncing  the  rewards  of  one's  actions  is
reiterated again and again by Lord Krishna.
