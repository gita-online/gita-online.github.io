Lord Krishna is explaining that  also  there  are  some  exceptions  to  the
previous verse. Those  of  purified  mind  and  cleansed  heart  who  nearly
dissolved  all  reactions  to  their  activities  in  past  lives   due   to
meritorious spiritual accomplishments. They will be  directly  born  into  a
family knowledgeable about the glories of the Supreme Lord and be  receptive
to spiritual activities right from the beginning  and  never  be  under  the
sway of delusion.
