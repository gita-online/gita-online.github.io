<i>Kuru-nandana</i>, O descendant of the Kuru dynasty; when the quality of tamas <i>vivrddhe</i>, predominates; <i>etani</i>, these 
indications; <i>eva</i>, surely; <i>jayante</i>, come into being; extreme <i>aprakasah</i>, non discrimination; and <i>apravrttih</i>, 
inactivity; its effects, <i>pramadah</i>, in advertence; and <i>mohah</i>, delusion, i.e. stupidity, which is a from of non-discrimination. 
Whatever result is achieved even after death, that is also owing to attachment and desire; everything is certainly caused by the qualities. 
By way of showing this the Lord says the next verse.
