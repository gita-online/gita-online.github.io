    <i>Tesam</i>, for them; <i>avyakta-asakta-cetasam</i>, who have their minds attached to the Unmanifest; <i>klesah</i>, 
    the struggle; is <i>adhika-tarah</i>, greater. Although the trouble is certainly great for those who are engaged in 
    works etc. for Me, still owing to the need of giving up self-identification with the body, it is greater in the 
    case of those who accept the Immutable as the Self and who kept in view the supreme Reality.

<p>
    <i>Hi</i>, for; <i>avyakta gatih</i>, the Goal which is the Unmanifest - (the goal) which stands in the form of the 
    Immutable; that is <i>avapyate</i>, attained; <i>duhkham</i>, with difficulty; <i>dehavadbhih</i>, by the embodied 
    ones, by those who identify themselves with the body. 
</p>

<p>Hence the struggle is greater. We shall speak later of the conduct of those who meditate on the Unmanifest.</p>
