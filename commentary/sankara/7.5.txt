<p>O mighty-armed one, <i>iyam</i>, this; is <i>apara</i>, the
inferior (Prakrti) - not the higher, (but) - the impure,
the source of evil and having the nature of worldly
bondage. <i>Viddhi</i>, know; <i>anyam</i>, the other, pure;
<i>prakrtim</i>, Prakrti; <i>me</i>, of Mine, which is essentially
Myself; which, <i>tu</i>, however; is <i>param</i>, higher, more
exalted; <i>itah</i>, than this (Prakrti) already spoken of;
<i>Jiva-bhutam</i>, which has taken the form of the
individual souls, which is characterized as 'the
Knower of the body (field),' and which is the cause
of sustenance of life; and <i>yaya</i>, by which Prakriti;
<i>idam</i>, this; <i>jagat</i>, world; <i>dharyate</i>, is upheld, by
permeating it.</p>
