<p>(<i>Tu</i>, but) <i>O Arjuna</i>, <i>Yoga na asti</i>, is not;
<i>atiasnatah</i>, for one who eats too much, for one who
eats food more than his capacity; <i>na ca</i>, nor is
Yoga; <i>anasnatah</i>, for one who does not eat;
<i>ekantam</i>, at all. This accords with the Vedic text,
'As is well known, if one eats that much food
which is within one's capacity, then it sustains him,
it does not hurt him; that which is more, it harms
him; that which is less, it does not sustain him' (Sa.
Br.; Bo. Sm. 2.7.22).</p>

<p>Therefore, a yogi should not eat
food more or less than what is suitable for him. Or
the meaning is that Yoga is not for one who eats
more food than what is prescribed for a yogi in the
scriptures on Yoga. Indeed, the quantity has been
mentioned in, 'One-half of the stomach is to be
filled with food, including curries; the third quarter
is to be filled with water; but the fourth quarter is
to be left for the movement of air,' etc. Similarly,
Yoga is not for <i>ati svapna-silasya</i>, one who
habitually sleeps too long; and Yoga is <i>na eva</i>,
surely not; <i>jagratah</i>, for one who keeps awake too
long. How, again, does Yoga become possible? This is
stated in the next verse.</p>
