<p>O Partha, <i>mayi asaktamanah</i>, having the mind
fixed on Me - one whose mind (<i>manah</i>) is fixed
(<i>asakta</i>) on Me (<i>mayi</i>) who am the supreme God
possessed of the qualification going to be spoken
of; <i>Yogam yunjan</i>, practising the Yoga of
Meditation, concentrating the mind. <i>Madasrayah</i>,
taking refuge in Me - one to whom I Myself, the
supreme Lord, am the refuge (<i>asraya</i>) is
<i>madasrayah</i>.</p>

<p>Anyone who hankers after some
human objective resorts to some rite such as the
Agnihotra etc., austerity or charity, which is the
means to its attainment. This yogi, however,
accepts only Me as his refuge; rejecting any other
means, he keeps his mind fixed on Me alone. <i>Srnu</i>,
hear; <i>tat</i>, that, which is being spoken of by Me; as
to <i>yatha</i>, how, the process by which; you who,
having become thus, <i>jnasyasi</i>, will know; <i>mam</i>,
Me; <i>asamsayam</i>, with certainty, without doubt,
that the Lord is such indeed; and <i>samagram</i>, in
fullness, possessed of such qualities as greatness,
strength, power, majesty, etc. in their fullness.</p>
