    O mighty-armed one-who are possessed of hands which are great and mighty, and extend upto the knees, <i>gunah</i>, the qualities are named 
    sattva, rajas and tamas. And they, <i>prakrti sambhavah</i>, born of Nature, born of Maya which belongs to God; <i>nibadhnanti</i>, bind, as it 
    were; the avyayam, immutable-the immutability has been spoken of in the verse, 'Being without beginning...,' etc. (13.31); <i>dehinam</i>, 
    embodied being; dehe, to the body.
</p> 

<p>
    The word guna is a technical term, and is not a quality like colour etc. which inherent in some substance. Nor is it meant here that quality .
    and substance are different. Therefore they are ever dependent on the Knower of the field, just as qualities are dependent (on some substance). 
    Being of the nature of ignorance, they bind the Knower of the field, as it were. They come into being, making That (Knower) their sustainer. 
    In this sense it is said that they bind. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Objection</b>: Was it not said that the embodied one does not become defiled (see 13.31-2)? So, why as it contrarily said here that 
    'they bind'? 
</p>

<p><i>Reply</i>: We have rebutted this objection by using the word iva (as it were) in 'they bind, as it were'.</p>
