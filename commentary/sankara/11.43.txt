    <i>Asi</i>, You are; <i>pita</i>, the Father, the Progenitor; <i>lokasya</i>, off all 
    beings; <i>cara-acarasya</i>, moving and nonmoving. Not only are You are Father of 
    this world, You are also <i>pujyah</i>, worthy of worship; since You are the <i>guruh</i>, 
    Teacher; 
</p>

<p>
    He is the Teacher since He introduce the line of teachers of what is virtue 
    and vice, and of the knowledge of the Self. And He is greater than a teacher 
    because He is the teacher even of Hiranyagarbha and others. 
</p>

<p>
    <i>gariyan</i>, greater (than a teacher). How are You greater? In answer he says: 
    <i>Asti</i>, there is; <i>na</i>, none other; <i>tvat-samah</i>, equal to You; 
    for there is no possibility of two Gods. Because all dealings will come to naught 
    f there be many Gods! 
</p>

<p>
    When there is no possibility of another being equal to You, <i>kutah eva</i>, how at all; 
    can there be <i>anyah</i>, anyone; <i>abhyadhikah</i>, greater; <i>api</i>, even; 
    <i>loka traye</i>, in all the three worlds; <i>apratima-prabhavah</i>, O you of unrivalled 
    power? 
</p>

<p>
    That by which something is measured is pratima. You who have no measure for Your power 
    (prabhava) are a pratima-prabhavah. Apratima-prabhava means 'O You of limitless power!'
