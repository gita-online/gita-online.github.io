<p><i>Hi</i>, for; <i>tena eva</i>, by that very; <i>purvaabhyasena</i>,
past practice-the powerful habit
formed in the past life; <i>hiryate</i>, he, the yogi who
had fallen from Yoga, is carried forward; <i>avasah api</i>, even inspite of himself.</p>

<p>If he had not committed any act which could be characterized as
unrigtheous etc. and more powerful than the
tendency created by the practice of Yoga, then he is
carried forward by the tendency created by the
practice of Yoga. If he had committed any
unrighteous act which was more powerful, then,
even the tendency born of Yoga gets surely
overpowered. But when that is exhausted, the
tendency born of Yoga begins to take effect by
itself. The idea is that it does not get destroyed,
even though it may lie in abeyance over a long
period.</p>

<p><i>Jijnasuh api</i>, even a seeker; <i>yogasya</i>, of
Yoga from the force of the context, the person
implied is a monk who had engaged in the path of
Yoga with a desire to known his true nature, but
had falled from Yoga; even he, <i>ativartate</i>,
trascends-will free himself from; <i>sabda-brahma</i>,
the result of the performance of Vedic ritual. What
to speak of him who after understanding Yoga,
may undertake it with steadfastness! And why is
the state of Yoga higher? That is explained in the
next verse.</p>
