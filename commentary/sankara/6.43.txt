<p><i>Tatra</i>, there, in the family of yogis; <i>labhate</i>,
tam <i>buddhi-samyogam</i>, he becomes endowed with
that wisdom; <i>paurva-dehikam</i>, acquired in the
previous body. And <i>yatate</i>, he strives; <i>bhuyah</i>,
more intensely; <i>tatah</i>, than before, more intensely
than that tendency acquired in the previous birth;
<i>samsiddau</i>, for, for the sake of, perfection; <i>kurunandana</i>,
O scion of the Kuru dynasty. How does
he become endowed with the wisdom acquired in
the previous body? That is answered in the next
verse.</p>
