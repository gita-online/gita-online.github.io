    It is <i>eva</i>, verily <i>amsah</i>, a part, portion, limb, fragment-these are all synonymous; <i>mama</i>, of mine, of the supreme Self; which, 
    <i>jiva-bhutah sanatanah</i>, becoming the eternal individual soul, will known as the enjoyer and agent; <i>jiva-loke</i>, in the region of living 
    beings, (i.e.) in the world.

    As the sun (reflected) in water is a part of the (actual) sun, and goes to the sun itself and does not return when the water, the cause of 
    the reflection, is removed, so also even this part becomes similarly united with that very Self; or, as space enclosed in a pot etc., delimited 
    by such adjuncts as the pot etc., being a part of Space does not return after being united with Space when the cause (of limitation), viz pot etc., 
    is destroyed. This being so, it has been rightly stated, 'by reaching which they do not return.'

    <b>Objection</b>: How can the partless supreme Self have any limb, fragment or part? If it has limbs, then there arises the contingency of Its 
    becoming destroyed through the dismemberment of the limbs!

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: This fault does not arise, since Its fragment, which is delimited by an adjunct arising out of ignorance, is imagined to be a part, 
    as it were. And this idea has been fully explained in the chapter (13) dealing with the 'field'. How that individual soul, imagined as a part of 
    Mine, enters into the world and leaves the body are being stated: <i>Karsati</i>, it draws to itself; <i>indriyani</i>, the (sense-) organs-ear 
    etc.; <i>manah-sasthani</i>, which have the mind as their sixth; and <i>prakrti-sthani</i>, which abide in Nature, which are located in their 
    respective spheres such as the orifice of the ear etc. When (does it draw the organs)?
