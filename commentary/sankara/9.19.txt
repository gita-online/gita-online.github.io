    O Arjuna, <i>aham</i>, I, in the form of the sun; <i>tapami</i>, give heat through 
    some intense rays. Through some rays <i>utsrjami</i>, I pour down; <i>varsam</i>, rain. 
    Having poured down, again <i>nigrhnami</i>, I withdraw it through some rays - for 
    eight months. Again I pour it down in the rainy season. I am <i>eva ca</i>, verily; 
    the <i>amrtam</i>, nectar of the gods; and <i>mrtyuh</i>, death of the mortals. 
    I Myself am <i>sat</i>, existence - the effect which has come into bneing in relation 
    to its cause; and its opposite, asat, nonexistence. 
</p>

<p>
    It is not that the Lord is Himself absolutely nonexistence; nor are effect and 
    cause (absolutely) existence and nonexistent (respectively). Those men of Knowledge 
    who meditate of Me while worshpping Me according to the respective forms of sacrifices 
    mentioned above-regardomg Me as one or multifirious, etc., they attain Me alone 
    according to their conceptions.
