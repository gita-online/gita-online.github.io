<i>Aruruksoh</i>, for one who wishes to ascend, who has not ascended, i.e. for that very person who is unable to remain 
established in Dhyana-yoga; for which person who is desirous to ascend; <i>Munih</i>, for the sage, i.e. for one who has 
renounced the results of actions; Trying to ascend to what? Yogam, to (Dhyana-)yoga;<i>karma</i>, action; <i>ucyate</i>, 
is said to be; the <i>karanam</i>, means. <i>Tasya</i>, for that person, again; <i>yoga-arudhasya</i>, when he has ascended 
to (Dhyana-) yoga; <i>samah</i>, inaction, withdrawl from all actions; <i>eva</i>, alone; <i>ucyate</i>, is said to be; 
<i>karanam</i>, the means for remaining poised in the state of meditation.<br><br>

To the extent that one withdraws from actions, the mind of that man who is at cease and self-controlled becomes concentrated. 
When this occurs, he at once becomes established in Yoga. And accordingly has it been said by Vyasa: 'For a Brahmana there is no 
wealth conparable to (the knowledge of) oneness, sameness, truthfulness, character, equipoise, harmlessness, straightforwardness 
and withdrawal from various actions' (Mbh. Sa. 175.37). After that, now is being stated when one becomes established in Yoga in
the next verse.
