    <i>Bharata-sattama</i>, O the most excellent among the descendants of Bharata; <i>srnu</i>, 
    hear, understand; <i>me</i>, from Me, from My statement; <i>niscayam</i>, the firm conclusion; 
    <i>tatra tyage</i>, regarding that tyaga, regarding these alternative veiws on tyaga and 
    sannyasa as they have been shown. 
</p>

<p>
    <i>Hi</i>, for; <i>purusavyaghra</i>, O greatest among men; <i>tyagah</i>, tyaga; 
    <i>samprakirtitah</i>, has been clearly declared, has been distinctly spoken of in the 
    scriptures; to be <i>trividhah</i>, of three kinds, threefold, under the classes of tamasa, etc.
</p> 

<p>
    The Lord has used the word tyaga with the idea that the (primary) meanings of tyaga and sannyasa 
    are verily the same. Since it is difficult to comprehend this idea, that the primary meanings 
    of the words tyaga and sannyasa can be threefold under the classification based on tamas etc. 
    in the case of one who is unenlightened and who is qualified for rites and duties-but not in 
    the case of one who has realized the supreme Goal, therefore no one else is capable of speaking 
    the truth in this connection. 
</p>

<p>
    Hence, listen to the firm conclusion of the Lord with regard to the supreme Truth as revealed by 
    the scriptures. Which, again, is this firm conclusion? In reply the Lord says in the next verse.
