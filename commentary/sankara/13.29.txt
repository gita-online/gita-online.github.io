    <b>Objection</b>: Is it not that no creature whatsoever injures himself by himself? Why do you refer to an irrelevant 
    thing by saying, 'He does not injure...,which is like saying, 'Fire should neither be lit on the earth nor in the sky,' etc.?

    <b>Reply</b>: This defect does not arise, because it is logical with reference to an unenlightened person's ignoring the Self. 
    For, all unillumined people ignore the very wellknown Self which is manifest and directly perceptible, and regard the non-Self 
    as the Self. By performing righteous and unrighteous acts they destroy even that self which has been accepted, and adopt 
    another new self. And destroying even that, they take up another. Similarly, destroying even that, they adopt another. 
    In this way they destroy the self that had been accepted successively. Thus, all unillumined persons are destroyers of the Self.

<p>
    But that which is the Self in reality, even that remains as though destroyed for ever by ignorance, because of the 
    absence of any benefit from Its presence. So, all unenlightened persons are, verily, destroyers of the Self. On the contrary, 
    the other person who has realized the Self as described does not injure in either way the Self by his own Self. Therefore 
    he attains the supreme Goal, i.e., the result stated above comes to him. Lest it be doubted that what was said in, 
    'seeing equally God who is present in all beings, he does not injure the Self by the Self, is improper with regard to the 
    selves which are diverse according to the differences created by the variety in their own qualities and actions, the Lord says
    the next verse.
