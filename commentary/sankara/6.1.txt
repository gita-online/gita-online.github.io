<i>Anasritah</i>, without depending on; On what? On that which is <i>karma-phalam</i>, the result of action i.e. without craving 
for the result of action. He who craves for the results of actions becomes dependent on the results of actions. But this person 
is the opposite of such a one. Hence (it is said), 'wihtout depending on the result of action. Having become so, <i>yah</i> he who; 
<i>karoti</i>, performs accomplishes; (karma, an action) which is his <i>karyam</i>, duty, the nityakarmas such as Agnihotra etc. 
which are opposed to the kamya-karmas.<br><br>

Whoever is a man of action of this kind is distinguished from the other men of action. In order to express this idea the Lord says, 
<i>sah</i>, he; is a sannyasi, monk, and a yogi. Sanyyasa, means renunciation. he who is possessed of this is a sannyasi, a monk. 
And he is also a yogi. Yoga means concentration of mind. He who has that is a yogi. It is to be understood that this man is possessed 
of these qualities. It is not to be understood that, only that person who does not keep a fire (niragnih) and who is actionless 
(akriyah) is a monk and a yogi. Niragnih is one from whom the fires which are the accessories of rites, have become dissociated. 
By kriya are mean austerity, charity, etc. which are performed wityout fire. <i>Akriyah</i>, actionless, is he who does not have 
even such kriyas.<br><br>

<b>Objection</b>: Is it not only with regard to one who does not keep a fire and is acitonless that monasticsm and meditativeness 
are well known in the Vedas, Smrtis and scriptures dealing with meditation? Why are monasticism and meditativeness spoken of here 
with regard to one who keeps a fire and is a man of action-which is not accepted as a fact?<br><br>

<b>Vedantin</b>: This defect does not arise, because both are sought to be asserted in some secondary sense.<br><br>

<b>Objection</b>: How is that?<br><br>

<b>Vedantin</b>: His being monk is by virtue of his having given up hankering for the results of actions; and his being a 
man of meditation is from the fact of his doing actions as accesories to meditation or from his rejection of thoughts for 
the results of actions which cause disturbances in the mind. Thus both are used in a figurative sense. On the contrary, 
it is not that monasticism and meditativeness are meant in the primary sense. The next verse elaborates on this idea.
