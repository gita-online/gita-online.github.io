    O mighty-armed one, <i>nibodha</i>, learn; <i>me</i>, from Me; <i>imani</i>, these; <i>panca</i>, five; 
    <i>karanani</i>, factors, accessories, which are going to be stated for drawing the attention of his 
    (Arjuna's) mind and for showing the difference among these categories [Categories: locus (body) etc], the 
    Lord praises those accessories in the succeeding verses as fit for being known; <i>siddhaye</i>, for the 
    accomplishment; <i>sarva-karmanam</i>, of all actions; <i>proktani</i>, which have been spoken of; 
    <i>sankhye</i>, in Vedanta-sankhya is that scripture where the subject-matters to be known are fully 
    (samyak) stated (khyayante); <i>krtante</i>, in which actions terminate. Krtante qualifies that very 
    word (Vedanta). <i>Krtam</i> means action. That in which occurs the culmination (anta) of that krtam is 
    krtantam, i.e. the termination of actions.

<p>
    In the texts, '...as much utility as a man has in a well' (2.46), and 'O son of Prtha, all actions 
    in their totality culminate in Knowledge' (4.33), the Lord shows the cessation of all actions 
    when the knowledge of the Self dawns. Hence (it is said): '...which have been spoken of in that 
    Vedanta where actions culminate and which is meant for the knowledge of the Self.' Which are they? 
    This is being answered in the next verse.
