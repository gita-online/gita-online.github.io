(And who,) <i>acetasah</i>, being non discriminating; <i>karsayantah</i>, torture; <i>bhuta gramam</i>, all the organs; <i>sarirastham</i>, in the body, <i>ca</i>, 
as also; torture <i>eva</i>, even; <i>mam</i>, Me; <i>antah sarira-stham</i>, who reside in the body as the witness of its actions and intellect-non-adherence 
to My injunctions itself is 'torturing Me'; <i>viddhi</i>, know; <i>tan</i>, them; <i>asura-niscayan</i>, as possessed of demoniacal convictions. Know them so that 
they may be avoided. This is an instruction. The liking of persons possessing the qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas for foods that are divided into three groups, 
viz succulent, oleaginous, etc., is respectively being shown here so that, by knowing the presence of the qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas (in oneself) from 
the indications of the degree of one's preference for particular foods as are succulent, oleaginous, etc., one may avoid foods having the characteristics of rajas 
and tamas, and accept food with the characteristics of sattva. Similarly, sacrifices etc. also are being explained here under three categories according to the 
distinguishing quality of sattva etc. So that one may reject those known to be born of rajas and tamas, and undertake only those born of sattva.
