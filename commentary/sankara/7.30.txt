<p><i>Ye</i>, those who; <i>viduh</i>, know; <i>mam</i>, Me; <i>saadhi-
bhuta-adhidaivam</i>, as existing in the physical
and the divine planes; <i>ca</i>, and also; <i>sa-adhiyajnam</i>,
as existing in the context of the sacrifice; <i>te</i>, they;
<i>yukta-cetasah</i>, of concentrated minds-those who
have their minds absorbed in God; <i>viduh</i>, know;
<i>mam</i>, Me; <i>api ca</i>, even; <i>prayanakale</i>, at the time of
death.</p>

<p>For those who are devoted to God, there is
not only the knowledge of Brahman as identified
with all individuals and all actions (see previous
verse), but also the knowledge of It as existing in
all things on the physical, the divine and the
sacrificial planes. Those who realize Brhaman as
existing in the context of all the five, viz of the
individual, of actions, of the physical,of the divine,
and of the sacrifices - for them with such a
realization there is no forgetting, loss of awareness,
of Brahman even at the critical moment of death.</p>
