<i>Yuktah</i>, remaining absorbed in the Self; <i>tattva vit</i>, 
the knower of Reality-knower of the real nature of Truth, of the Self, 
i.e., the seer of the supreme Reality; <i>manyeta</i>, should think; 
'na karomi eva, I certainly do not do; <i>kincit</i>, anything.' 
Having realized the Truth, when or how should he think? This is being 
answered:<br><br>

<i>Api</i>, even; <i>pasyan</i>, while seeing; <i>srnvan</i>, hearing; 
<i>sprsan</i>, touching; <i>jighran</i>, smelling; <i>asnan</i>, eating; 
<i>gacchan</i>, moving; <i>svapan</i>, sleeping; <i>svasan</i>, breathing; 
<i>pralapan</i>, speaking; <i>visrjan</i>, releasing; <i>grhnan</i>, 
holding; <i>unmisan</i>, opening; <i>nimisan</i>, closing the eyes. 
All these are to be connected with the above manyeta (should think). 
For the man who has known the Truth thus, who finds nothing but inaction 
in action-in all the movements of the body and organs, and who has full 
realization, there is competence only for giving up all actions because of 
his realization of the nonexistence of actions. Indeed, one who proceeds 
to drink water in a mirage thinking that water is there, surely does not 
go there itself for drinking water even after knowing that no water exists 
there!
