    <i>Idam</i>, this Scripture; which has been taught by Me <i>te</i>, to you, for your good, 
    for terminating mundane existence; <i>an vacyam</i>, should not be taught (na is 
    connected with the remote word vacyam); <i>atapaskaya</i>, to one who is devoid of austerities. 
    It should <i>kadacana</i>, never, under any condition whatsoever; be taught <i>abhaktaya</i>, 
    to one who is not a devotee, who is devoid of devotion to his teacher and God, even if he 
    be a man of austerity. 
</p>

<p>
    Neither should it be taught even <i>asurusave</i>, to one who does not render service even 
    though he may be a devotee and a man of austerity. <i>Na ca</i>, nor as well; to him 
    <i>yah</i>, who; <i>abhyasuyati</i>, cavils; <i>mam</i>, at Me, at Vasudeva thinking that 
    I am an ordinary person; to him who, not knowing My Godhood, imputes self-adulation etc. to 
    Me and cannot tolerate Me. He too is unfit; to him also it should not be imparted. From 
    the force of the context it is understood that the Scripture should be taught to one who 
    has devotion to the Lord, is austere, renders service, and does not cavil. As to that, since 
    it is seen (in a Smrti)-'to one who is intelligent or to one who is austere'-that there is 
    an option between the two, it follows that this should be imparted either to an austere 
    person given to service and devotion, or to an intelligent person endowed with them. 
    It should not be imparted to an austere or even an intelligent person if he lacks service 
    and devotion.

<p>
    It should not be taught to one who cavils at the Lord, even though he be possessed of all the 
    good qualities. And it should be taught to one who serves his teacher and is devout. This 
    is the rule for transmitting the Scripture. Now the Lord states the fruit derived by one 
    who transmits the Scripture in the next verse.
