<p>O Arjuna, <i>aham</i>, I, however; <i>veda</i>, know;
<i>samatitani</i>, the past beings; and <i>vartamanani</i>, the
present. I know <i>ca</i>, also; <i>bhavisyani</i>, the
future; <i>bhutani</i>, beings. <i>Tu</i>, but; <i>na kascana</i>, no one; <i>veda</i>,
knows; <i>mam</i>, Me.</p>

<p>Except the one person who is
My devotee and has taken refuge in Me, no one
adores Me, just because he does not know My
reality. 'What, again, is the obstruction to knowing
Your reality, being prevented by which the
creatures that are born do not know You?' In
anticipation of such a question, the Lord says the
next verse.</p>
