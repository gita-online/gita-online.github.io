By saying, 'who have been killed by Me,' the Lord names Drona and those very warriors with regard to whom Arjuna 
had (his) doubts. Now then, uncertainty with regard to Drona and Bhisma is well-founded. Drona was the teacher of 
the science of archery, and was equipped with heavenly weapons; and particularly, he was his (Arjuna's) own 
teacher and most respected. Bhisma was destined to die at will, and possessed heavenly weapons. He fought a 
duel with Parasurama and remained unvanquished. So also Jayadratha-whose father was performing an austerity with 
the idea that anyone who made his son's head fall on the ground would have even his own head fall. Since Karna 
also was equipped with an unerring spear given by Indra, and was a son of the Sun, born of a maiden (Kunti), 
therefore he is referred to by his own name itself. 

As a mere instrument, <i>tvam</i>, you; <i>jahi</i>, destory them; who have been <i>hatan</i>, killed; 
<i>maya</i>, by Me. Ma, do not; <i>vyathisthah</i>, be afraid of them. <i>Yuddhyasva</i>, fight. <i>Jetasi</i>, 
you shall conquer; the <i>sapatnan</i>, enemies - Duryodhana and others; <i>rane</i>, in battle.
