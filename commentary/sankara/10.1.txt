    O mighty-armed one, <i>srnu</i>, listen; <i>bhuyah eva</i>, over agiain; <i>me</i>, to My; 
    <i>paramam</i>, supreme; vacah, utterance, which is expressive of the transcendental Reality; 
    <i>yat</i>, which supreme Truth; <i>aham</i>, I; <i>vaksyami</i>, shall speak; <i>te</i>, 
    to you; <i>priyamanaya</i>, who take delight (in it). 
</p>

<p>
    You become greatly pleased by My utterance, like one drinking ambrosia. Hence, I shall speak 
    to you hita kamyaya, wishing your welfare. 'Why shall I speak?' In answer to this the Lord 
    says the next verse.
