    Having given up his external evil behaviour due to the strength of his internal proper 
    resolves, <i>ksipram bhavati</i>, he soon becomes; verily <i>dharma atma</i>, possessed 
    of a virtuous mind; and <i>nigaccahti</i>, he attains; <i>sasvat</i>, everlasting; 
    <i>santim</i>, peace, quietude.

    O son of Kunti, listen to the supreme Truth: <i>Pratijanihi</i>, do you proclaim boldly, 
    make a firm declaration; that <i>me</i>, My; <i>bhaktah</i>, devotee, who has dedicated 
    his inner being to Me; na, does not; <i>pranasyati</i>, get ruined.
