    <i>Deha-bhrta</i>, for one who holds on to a body one who maintains (bibharti) a body (deha) is called a 
    deha-bhrt. One who has self indentification with the body is called a deha-bhrt, but not a so a man of 
    discrimination; for he has been excluded from the eligibility for agentship by such texts as, 
    'He who knows this One is indestructible...' etc. Hence, for that unenlightened person who holds on 
    to the body, <i>he</i>, since; it is <i>na</i>, not; <i>sakyam</i>, possible; <i>tyaktum</i>, to give up, 
    renounce; <i>karmani</i>, actions; <i>asesatah</i>, entirely, totally; therefore the ignorant person 
    who is competent (for rites and duties), <i>yah</i>, who; <i>tu</i>, on the other hand; 
    <i>karma-phala-tyagi</i>, renounces results of actions, relinquishes only the hankering for the results 
    of actions while performing the nityakarmas; <i>sah</i>, he; is <i>abhidhiyate</i>, called; <i>tyagi iti</i>, 
    a man of renunciation-even though he continues to be a man of rites and duties.

    This is said by way of eulogy. Therefore total renunciation of actions is possible only for one who 
    has realized the supreme Truth, who does not hold on to the body, and who is devoid of the idea that 
    the body is the Self. Again, what is that purpose which is accomplished through renunciation of all 
    actions? This is being stated in the next verse.
