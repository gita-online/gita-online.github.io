    O scion of the Bharata dynasty, the <i>sraddha</i>, faith; <i>sarvasya</i>, of all beings; <i>bhavati</i>, is; <i>sattva anurupa</i>, in accordance with their minds, 
    in accordance with the internal organ which is imbued with particular impression. If this is so, what follows? 
</p>

<p>The answer is: <i>Ayam</i>, this; <i>purusah</i>, person, the transmigrating soul; is <i>sraddhamayah</i>, made up of faith as the dominating factor. </p>

<p>
    How? <i>Sah</i>, he, the individual soul; is <i>eva</i>, verily; <i>sah</i>, that; <i>yah yat-sraddhah</i>, which is the faith of that individual-he surely conforms 
    to his faith. And, as a consequence, a person's steadfastness in sattva etc. is to be inferred from the grounds of his actions such as worship of gods etc. Hence 
    the Lord says the next verse.
