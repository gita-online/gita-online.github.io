    And some, however, <i>yoginah</i>, the yogis of concentrated minds; <i>yatantah</i>, who are diligent; <i>pasyanti</i>, see; <i>evam</i>, this one, the 
    Self under discussion; as <i>avasthitam</i>, existing; <i>atmani</i>, in themselves, in their own intelligence. They realize, 'I am This.' <i>Acetasah</i>, 
    the non-discriminating ones; <i>akrta-atmanah</i>, who lack self-control, who have not purified themselves through austerity and control of the organs, 
    who have not desisted from bad conduct, who are not tranquil and are proud by nature; <i>na</i>, do not; <i>pasyanti</i>, see; <i>enam</i>, this one; 
    <i>api</i>, though; (they be) <i>yatantah</i>, diligent-even though they be striving with the help of the valid means of knowledge such as the scriptures.

    With a view to speaking of the all-pervasiveness of the State and the fact of Its being the substratum of all empirical dealings, the Lord speaks in 
    brief through the following four verses of the divine manifestations of that State which the light of fire, sun, etc. do not illumine though they 
    are the illuminators of everything; and reaching which the aspirants of Liberation do not return again towards mundane existence; and of which State the 
    individual souls, owing to their conformity with the diversity of limiting adjuncts, are parts, just as spaces enclosed in pot etc. are 'parts' of Space
    in the next verse.
