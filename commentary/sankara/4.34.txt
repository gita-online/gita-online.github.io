<i>Viddhi</i>, know; <i>tat</i>, that, the process by which It is acquired; by approaching teachers <i>pranipatena</i>, 
through prostration, by lying fully streched on the ground with face downward, with prolonged salutation; <i>pariprasnena</i>, 
through inquiry, as to how bondage and Liberation come, and what are Knowledge and ignorance; and <i>sevaya</i>, 
through the service of the guru. Know it through these and other (disciplines).<br><br>

Being pleased with humility, <i>jnaninah</i>, the wise ones, the teachers; <i>tattva-darsinah</i>, who have realized the 
Truth; <i>upadeksyanti</i>, will impart, will tell; <i>te</i>, you; <i>jnanam</i>, the Knowledge as described above.<br><br>

Although people may be wise, some of them are apt to know Truth just as it is, while others may not be so. Hence the
 qualification, 'who have realized the Truth'. The considered view of the Lord is that Knowledge imparted by those who have 
 full enlightenment becomes effective, not any other. That being so, the next verse also becomes appropriate.
