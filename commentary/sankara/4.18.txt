Since engagement and non-engagement (in 
action) depend on an agent, therefore, <i>yah</i>, he who; 
<i>pasyet</i>, ie. pasyati, finds; akarma, inaction, absence 
of action; <i>karmani</i>, in action-karma means 
whatever is done, action in general; in the action; 
and <i>yah</i>, who; finds karma, action; <i>akarmani</i>, in 
inaction, in the absence of action; <i>sah</i>, he; is 
<i>buddhiman</i>, a wise one; <i>manusyesu</i>, among men.<br><br>

All dealings involving an act, accessories, etc. exist 
certainly on the plane of ignorance, only so long as one has not 
attained to the Reality. He is a yogi, <i>yuktah</i>, 
engaged in yoga; and a <i>krtsna-karma-krt</i>, 
performer of all actions. One who discriminates 
between action and actions. One who discriminates 
between action and inaction is praised thus.<br><br>

<b>Objection</b>: Well, what is meant by this 
contradictory statement, 'He who finds inaction in 
action', and 'action in inaction'? For action cannot 
become inaction, nor inaction action. That being so, 
how can a witness have (such) an incongruous 
perception?<br><br>

<b>Vedantin</b>: Is it not that to an ordinary foolish 
observer, that which is reality is inaction appears 
as action, and similarly, action itself as inaction? 
That being so, in order to show things as they are 
the Lord says, 'He who finds inaction in action', etc. 
Therefore there is no incongruity. Besides, the 
qualifications such as 'intelligent' etc. (thus) 
become logical. And by saying, 'there is something 
to be known', is implied the perception of things as 
they are. Moreover, freedom from evil cannot 
follow from an erroneous perception; whereas it 
has been said, 'by knowing which you will become 
free from evil'. Therefore, one account of action 
and inaction being perceived contrarily by the 
creatures, the Lord's utterance, 'he who finds 
inaction in action,' etc. is for dispelling their 
contrary perception. Not that in the empirical 
plane inaction has action as its receptacle, like a 
plum in a bowl! Nor even has action inaction as its 
receptacle, because inaction is a negation of action. 
Therefore, action and inaction are actually 
perceived contrarily by the ordinary persons-like 
seeing water in a mirage, or silver in nacre.<br><br>

<b>Objection</b>: Is it not that to every one action is action 
itself? Never is there an exception to this.<br><br>

<b>Vedantin</b>: That is not so, because when a boat is moving, 
motionless trees on the bank appear to move in the 
opposite direction to a man on the boat; an absence 
of motion is noticed in distant moving things 
which are not near one's eyes. Similarly, here also 
occurs the contrary perceptions, viz seeing action 
in inaction under the idea, 'I am doing',
and seeing, inaction in acion, because of which it is 
said, 'He who finds inaction in action,' etc. in order 
to eliminate them. As such, although this answer 
has been given more than once, still a man 
becomes repeatedly deluded under the influence of 
a totally opposite perception. And forgetting the 
truth that has been heard again and again, he 
repeatedly raises false issues and questions! And 
therefore, observing that the subject is difficult to 
understand, the Lord gives His answer again and 
again. The absence of action in the Self-well-known 
from the Vedas, Smrtis and logic, as stated in, '(It is 
said that) This is unmanifest; This is inconceivable' 
(2.25), 'Never is this One born, and never does It 
die' (2.20; Ka. 1.2.18), etc. has been and will be 
spoken of. The contrary perception of action in that 
actionless Self, i.e. in inaction, is very deep-rooted, 
owing to which 'even the intelligent are 
confounded as to what is action and what is 
inaction.'<br><br>

And as a consequence of the superimposition 
of aciton pertaining to the body etc. on the Self, 
there arises such ideas as, 'I am an 
agent; this is my action; its result is to be enjoyed 
by me.' Similarly, with the idea, 'I shall remain 
quiet, whereby I shall be free from exertion, free 
from activity, and happy', and superimposing on 
the Self the cessation of activities pertaining to the 
body and organs and the resulting happiness, a
man imagines, 'I shall not do anything; I shall sit 
quietly and happily.' That being so, the Lord says, 
'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. with a view to 
removing this contrary understanding of man. And 
here in this world, though action belonging to the 
body and organs continues to be action, still it is 
superimposed by everyone on the acitonless, 
unchanging Self, as a result of which even a 
learned person things, 'I act.' Therefore, in action 
(karmani), which is universally considered by all 
people to be inherent in the Self, like the perception 
of motion in the (stationary) trees on the bank of a 
river-(in that action) he who contrariwise finds the 
fact of inaction, like perceiving absence of motion 
in those trees. And, in inaction (akarmani) in the
cessation of the activities pertaining to the body 
and organs and ascribed to the Self in the same 
way that actions are ascribed-, in that action, he 
who sees action because of egoism being implicit in 
the idea, 'I am happily seated quietly, without 
doing anything'; he who knows thus the 
distinction between action and inaction, is wise, is 
learned among men; he is engaged in yoga, he is a 
yogi, and a performer of all actions. And he, freed 
from evil, attains fulfilment. This is the meaning. 
This verse is interpreted by some in another way. 
How?<br><br>

(Thus:) 'Since the daily obligatory duties 
(nityakarmas) certainly have no results when 
performed as a dedication to God, therefore, in a 
secondary sense, they are said to be inaction. 
Again, the non-performance of these (nitya-
karmas) is inaction; since this produces an evil 
result, therefore it is called action, verily in a 
figurative sense. That being so, he who sees 
inaction in the daily obligatory duties (nitya-karmas) 
owing to the obsence of their results-in the 
same way as a cow that does not yield milk is said 
to be not a cow, though in reality it is so-so also, in 
the non-performance of the daily obligatory duties, 
i.e. in inaction, he who sees action since that yields 
results such as hell etc...' This explanation is not 
logical, because freedom from evil as a result of 
such knowledge is unreasonable, and the utterance 
of the Lord in the sentence, '...by knowing which 
you will become freed from evil', will be 
contradicted. How? Even if it be that liberation 
from evil follows from the performance of nitya-karmas, 
it cannot, however, follow from the 
knowledge of the absence of their results. For it has 
not been enjoined (anywhere) that knowledge of 
the nityakarmas (themselves), leads to the result of 
freedom from evil. Nor has this been stated here by 
the Lord Himself. Hereby is refuted the 'seeing of 
action in inaction', for 
(according to the opponent) 'seeing of action in 
inaction' has not been enjoined here as a duty, but (what has been 
enjoined is) merely that performance of the 
nityakarmas is obligatory. Moreover, no result can 
accrue from the knowledge that evil arises from 
non-performance of nityakramas. Nor even has 
non-performance of nityakarmas. been enjoined as 
something that should be known. Besides, such 
results as freedom from evil, wisdom, engagement 
in yoga, and being a performer of all actions cannot 
reasonably follow from a false perception of action 
as inaction. Nor is this a eulogy of false perception.<br><br>

Indeed, false perception is 
itself an abvious form of evil! How can it bring 
about liberation from another evil? Surely, 
darkness does not become the remover of 
darkness!<br><br>

<b>Opponent</b>: Well, the seeing of inaction in 
action, or the seeing of action in inaction - that is not 
a false perception?<br><br>

<b>Vedantin</b>: What then?<br><br> 

<b>Opponent</b>: It is a figurative statement based on the 
existence or the non-existence of results.<br><br>

<b>Vedantin</b>: Not so, because there is no such scriptural 
statement that something results from knowing 
action as inaction and inaction as action, even in a 
figurative sense. Besides, nothing particular is 
gained by rejecting what is heard of (in the 
scriptures) and imagining something that is not. 
Further, it was possible (for the Lord) to express in 
His own words that there is no result from the 
nityakarmas, and that by their non-performance 
one would have to go to hell. Under such 
circumstances, what was the need of the 
ambiguous statement, 'He who sees inaction in 
action,' etc., which is misleading to others? This 
being the case, such an explanation by anyone will 
be clearly tantamount to imagining that statement 
of the Lord as meant for deluding people. 
Moreover, this subject-matter (performance of 
nityakarmas) is not something to be protected with 
mystifying words. It is not even logical to say that 
the subject-matter will become easy for 
comprehension if it is stated again and again 
through different words. For, the subject-matter 
that was stated more clearly in, 'Your right is for 
action alone' (2.47), does not need any repetition. 
And everwhere it is said that whatever is good and 
ought to be practised deserves to be understood; 
anything purposeloss does not deserve to be 
known.<br><br>

Besides, neither is false knowledge worth 
acquiring nor is the semblance of an object 
presented by it worth knowing. Nor even can any 
evil, which is an entity, arise from the non-performance of nityakarmas, 
which is a non-entity, for there is the statement, 'Of the unreal 
is no being' (2.16), and (in the Upanisad) it has been 
pointed out, 'How can existence originate from 
nonexistence?' (Ch. 4.2.2). Since emergence of the 
existent from the nonexistent has been denied, 
therefore anyone's assertion that the existent 
originates from the nonexistent will amount to 
saying that a non-entity becomes an entity, and an 
entity becomes a non-entity! And that is not 
rational because it runs counter to all the means of 
valid knowledge. Further, the scriptures cannot 
enjoin fruitless actions, they being naturally 
painful; and it is illogical that what is painful 
should be done intentionally.<br><br>

Also, if it is admitted that falling into 
hell results from their non-performance 
(i.e. of the nityakarmas), then that too 
is surely a source of evil. In either case, whether 
one undertakes them or not, the scriptures will be 
imagined to be useless. And there will be a 
contradiction with your own standpoint when, 
after holding that the nityakarmas are fruitless, you 
assert that they lead to Liberation. Therefore, the 
meaning of 'He who finds inaction in action,' etc. is 
just what stands out literally. And the verse has 
been explained by us accordingly. The aforesaid 
perception of 'inaction in action,' etc. is being 
praised in the next verse.
