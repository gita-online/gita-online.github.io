<i>Apare</i>, other; <i>yoginah</i>, yogis, ritualists; <i>pari upasate</i>, undertake; <i>yajnam</i>, 
sacrifice; <i>daivam</i>, to gods; <i>eva</i>, alone. A sacrifice by which the gods are adored is

<i>Brahma-agnau</i>, in the fire of Brahman: By the word brahman is meant That which is referred 
to in such sentences as, 'Brahman is Truth, knowledge and infinite' (Tai. 2.1), 'Knowledge, Bliss, 
Brahman' (Br. 3.9.28), 'the Brahman that is immediate and direct-the self that is within all' 
(Br.3.4.1), which is devoid of all worldly characteristiscs like hunger etc. and which is beyond 
all particular qualifications-as stated in, 'Not this, not this' (Br.4.4.22).<br><br>

That which is Brahman is the fire. Brahman is called fire because, as reflected in wisdom, 
It burns away everything, i.e. ignorance, or because everything merges into It during 
dissolution (pralaya). And it is spoken of as Brahmagni with a view to referring to It as 
that into which the offering is made. In that fire of Brahman, <i>apare</i>, others, other knowers of 
Brahman; <i>upa-juhvati</i>, offer; <i>yajnam</i>, the Self, which is referred to by the word 
yajna (sacrifice), it, having, been presented as a synonym of the Self; that Self, which is a 
sacrifice, which is reality is verily the supreme Brahman, which is associated with such 
limiting adjuncts as the intellect etc., which is associated with all the qualities of the 
limiting adjuncts superimposed on it, and which is the oblation, (they offer) yajnena, by the 
Self itself as described above.<br><br>

The offering (of the Self) in that (Brahman) is nothing but the realization of that Self which 
is assoicated with the limiting adjuncts to be the supreme Brahman which is free from adjuncts. 
The monks, steadfast in the realization of the identity of Brahman and the Self, make that 
offering. This is the meaning. Beginning with, 'The ladle is Brahman' etc., this sacrifice 
characterized as full realization is being included among such sacrifices as daiva-yajna etc. 
with a view to eulogizing it in the verses beginning with, 'O destroyer of enemies, jnana-yajna 
is greater than the sacrifices involving (sacrificial) materials'.
