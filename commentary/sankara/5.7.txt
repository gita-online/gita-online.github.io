When again, as a means to attain full enlightenment, this person becomes <i>yoga-yuktah</i>, endowed with yoga; 
<i>visuddhatma</i>, pure in mind; <i>vijitatma</i>, controlled in body; <i>jitendriyah</i>, a conqueror of the organs; 
and <i>sarva-bhutatma bhutatma</i>, the Self of the selves of all beings-one whose Self (atma), the inmost consciousness, 
has become the selves (atma) of all beings (sarva bhuta) beginning from Brahma to a clump of grass, i.e., fully illumined; 
(then,) thus continuing in that state, he na lipyate, does not become tainted; <i>kurvan api</i>, even while performing 
actions for preventing mankind from going astray. That is to say, he does not become bound by actions. And besides, this 
person does not act in the real sense.
