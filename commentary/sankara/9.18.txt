<p>
    (I am) the <i>gatih</i>, fruit of actions; the <i>bharta</i>, nourisher; the <i>prabhuh</i>, 
    Lord; the <i>saksi</i>, witness of all tha is done or not done by creatures; the 
    <i>nivasah</i>, abode, where creatures live; the <i>saranam</i>, refuge, remover of 
    sufferings of the afflicted who take shelter; the <i>suhrt</i>, friend, one who does 
    a good turn without thought of reward; the <i>prabhavah</i>, origin of the world; 
    the <i>pralayah</i>, end, the place into which the world merges. 
</p>

<p>
    So also, (I am) the <i>sthanam</i>, foundation on which the world rests; the 
    <i>nidhanam</i>, store, which is for future enjoyment of creatures; and the 
    <i>avyayam</i>, imperishable; <i>bijam</i>, seed, the cause of growth of all things 
    which germinate. 
</p>

<p>
    The seed is imperishable because it continues so long as the world lasts. Indeed, 
    nothing springs up without a seed. And since creation is noticed to be continuous, 
    it is understood that the continuity of the seed never ends.
