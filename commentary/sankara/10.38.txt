<i>Damayatam</i>, of the punishers; I am <i>dandah</i>, the punishment, which is the means of controlling the 
lawless. I am the <i>nitih</i>, righteous policy; <i>jagisatam</i>, of those who desire to conquer. And 
<i>guhyanam</i>, of things secret; I am verily <i>maunam</i>, silence. I am <i>jnanam</i>, knowledge; 
<i>jnanavatam</i>, of the men of knowledge.
