<i>Sakhah</i>, the branches, as it were; <i>tasya</i>, of that Tree; <i>prasrtah</i>, extending; <i>adhah</i>, downwards, from the human beings 
to the immobile (trees etc.); <i>ca</i>, and; <i>urdhvam</i>, upwards, upto Brahma beginning from the Creator of the Cosmos to Dharma (Death), 
which, 'in accordance with their work and in conformity with their knowledge' (Ka.2.2.7), are the results of knowledge and actions; are 
<i>guna-pravrddhah</i>, strengthened, made stout, by the qualities sattva, rajas and tamas, which are their materials; and <i>visaya-pravalah</i>, 
have the sense-objects as their shoots. The sense-objects (sound etc.) sprout, as it were, like new leaves from the branches (bodies etc.) 
which are the results of actions. Thereby the branches are said to have sense-objects as their shoots. The supreme Root, the material cause of 
the Tree of the World, has been stated earlier. And now, the latent impressions of attraction, repulsion, etc. born of the results of 
action are the subsidiary roots, as it were, which grow later on and become the cause of involvement in righteousness and and unrighteousness. 
And those mulani, roots; <i>karma anubandhini</i>, which are followed by actions; <i>anu santatani</i>, spread, enter; <i>adhah</i>, downwards, 
as compared with the world of gods; <i>manusya-loke</i>, into the world of human beings particularly-for it is well known that (only) here men 
have competence for rites and duties. They (these roots) are said to be karma-anubandhini since actions (karma) that are characterized as righteous 
and unrighteous follow as their product (anubandha), (i.e.) succeed the rise of those (attraction, repulsion, etc.).
