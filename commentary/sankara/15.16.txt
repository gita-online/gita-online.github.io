There are <i>imau</i>, these; <i>dvau</i>, two-grouped separately; <i>purusau</i>, persons, so called; <i>loke</i>, in the world; the <i>ksarah</i>, 
mutable-one group consists of the perishable; the other person is the <i>aksarah</i>, immutable, opposite of the former, the power of God called Maya, which 
is the seed of the origin of the person called the mutable. That which is the receptacle of the impressions of desires, actions, etc. of countless transmigrating 
creatures is called the immutable person. Who are those persons? 

The Lord Himself gives the answer: <i>Ksarah</i>, the mutable; consists of <i>sarvani</i>, all; <i>bhutani</i>, things, i.e. the totality of all mutable things. 
<i>Kutasthah</i> is the one existing as Maya: Kuta means a heap; kutasthah, is that which exists like a heap. Or, kuta is maya, deception, falsehood, crookedness, 
which are synonymous; that which exists in the diverse forms of maya etc. is the kutasthah. It is <i>ucyate</i>, called; the <i>aksarah</i>, immutable, because, 
owing to the countless seeds of worldly existence, it does not perish.
