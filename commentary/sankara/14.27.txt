    <i>Hi</i>, for; <i>aham</i>, I, the inmost Self; am the <i>pratistha brahmanah</i>, Abode-that in which something abides is pratistha, of Brahman 
    which is the supreme Self. Of Brahman of what kind? <i>Amrtasya</i>, of that which is indestructible; <i>avyayasya</i>, of that which is 
    immutable; and <i>sasvatasya</i>, of that which is eternal; <i>dharmasya</i>, of that which is the Dharma, realizable through the Yoga of 
    Jnana which is called dharma (virtue); and <i>aikantikasya sukhasya</i>, of that which is the absolute, unfailing Bliss by nature.

    Since the inmost Self is the abode of the supreme Self-which by nature is immortal etc., therefore, through perfect Knowledge it (the former) 
    is realized with certainty to be the supreme Self. This has been stated in, 'he qualifies for becoming Brahman'. The purport is this: 
    Indeed, that power of God through which Brahman sets out, comes forth, for the purpose of favouring the devotees, etc., that power which is 
    Brahman Itself, am I. For, a power and the possesser of that power are non-different. Or, brahman means the conditioned Brahman, since It (too,) 
    is referred to by that word. 'Of that Brahman, I Myself, the unconditioned Brahman-and none else-am the Abode.' (The abode of Brahman) of what 
    qualities? Of that which is immortal; of that which has the quality of deathlessness; of that which is immutable; so also, of that which is the 
    eternal; which is the dharma having the characteristics of steadfastness in Knowledge; of that which is the absolute, unquestionably certain 
    Bliss born of that (steadfastness); 'I am the Abode' is understood.
