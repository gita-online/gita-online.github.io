<i>Budhah</i>, the wise, the knowers of Brahman;
<i>ahuh</i>, call; <i>tam</i>, him; <i>panditam</i>, learned, in the real
sense; <i>yasya</i>, whose, of the one who perceives as
stated above; <i>samarambhah</i>, actions - whatever are
undertaken; are <i>sarve</i>, all; <i>kama-sankalpa-varjitah</i>,
devoid of desires and the thoughts which are their
(desires') causes (see 2.62) i.e., (those actions) are
performed as mere movements, without any selfish
purpose: if they are performed by one (already)
engaged in actions, then they are for preventing
people from going astray, and if they are done by
one who has withdrawn from actions, then they
are merely for the maintenance of the body; and
<i>jnanagni-dagdha-karmanam</i>, whose actions have
been burnt away by the fire of wisdom. Finding
inaction etc. in action etc. is <i>jnana</i>, wisdom; that
itself is <i>agnih</i>, fire. He whose actions, karma,
described as good and bad, have been dagdhani,
burnt away by that fire of wisdom, is <i>jnana-agnidagdha-karma</i>.<br><br>

However, one who is a perceiver of
'inaction' is free from actions owing to
the very fact of his seeing 'inaction' etc. He is a
monk, who acts merely for the purpose of
maintaining the body. Being so, he does not engage
in actions although he might have done so before
the dawn of discrimination. He again who, having
been engaged in actions under the influence of past
tendencies, later on becomes endowed with the
fullest Self-knowledge, he surely renounces (all) actions along
with their accessories as he does nnot find any
purpose in activity. For some reason, if it becomes
impossible to renounce actions and he, for the sake
of preventing people from going astray, even
remains engaged as before in actions-without
attachment to those actions and their results
because of the absence of any selfish purpose, still
he surely does nothing at all! His actions verily
become 'inaction' because of having been burnt
away by the fire of wisdom. By way of pointing
out this idea, the Lord says the next verse.
