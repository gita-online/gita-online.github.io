    <i>Aham</i>, I; <i>icchami</i>, want; <i>drastum</i>, to see; <i>tvam</i>, You; <i>kiritinam</i>, 
    wearing a crown; as also gadinam, wielding a mace; and <i>cakra-hastam</i>, holding a disc in hand; 
    i.e., <i>tatha eva</i>, just as before. Since this is so, therefore, <i>sahasra-baho</i>, 
    O You with a thousand arms-in Your present Cosmic form; <i>visva-murte</i>, O you of Cosmic form; 
    <i>bhava</i>, apeear; <i>tena eva rupena</i>, with that very form - with the form of the son of 
    Vasudeva; <i>caturbhujena</i>, with four hands.

<p>
    The idea is: withdrawing the Cosmic form, appear in that very form as the son of Vasudeva. 
    Noticing Arjuna to have become afraid, and withdrawing the Cosmic form, reassuring him with 
    sweet words, the Lord says the next verse.
