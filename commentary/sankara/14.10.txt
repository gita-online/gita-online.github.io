<p>
    O scion of the Bharata dynasty, <i>sattva bhavati</i>, increases, comes into being; <i>abhibhuya</i>, by subduing both rajas and tamas. 
    When sattva increases, then, coming to its own, it produces its own effects-knowledge, happiness, etc. Similarly, when the quality of rajas 
    increases by overpowering both sattva and tamas, then it produces its own effects-activity and hankering. When the quality called tamas 
    increases by similarly dominating over sattva and rajas, it then produces its own effects-obscuring of knowledge, etc.

<p>When any quality preponderates, then what is its indication? This is being answered in the next verse.</p>
