    <i>Ca</i>, and; <i>avyabhicarini</i>, unwavering-not having any tendency to deviate; <i>bhaktih</i>, 
    devotion; <i>mayi</i>, to Me, to God; <i>ananya-yogena</i>, with single minded concentration, with 
    undivided concentration-ananyayogah is the decisive, unswerving conviction of this kind: 'There is 
    none superior to Lord Vasudeva, and hence He alone is our Goal'; adoration with that. That too is 
    Knowledge. <i>Vivikta-desa-sevitvam</i>, inclination to repair into a clean place-a place (desa) naturally 
    free (vivikta) or made free from impurity etc. and snakes, tigers, etc.; or, place made solitary (vivikta) 
    by being situated in a forest, on a bank of a river, or in a temple; one who is inclined to seek such a 
    place is <i>vivikta-desa-sevi</i>, and the abstract form of that is vivikta-desa-sevitvam.

    Since the mind becomes calm in places that are indeed pure (or solitary), therefore meditation on the 
    Self etc. occurs in pure (or solitary) places. Hence the inclination to retire into clean (or solitary) 
    places is called Knowledge.

    <i>Aratih</i>, lack of delight, not being happy; <i>jana-samadi</i>, in crowd of people-an assemblage, 
    a multitude of people without culture, lacking in purity and immodest, (but) not (so) in a gathering 
    of pure and modest persons since that is conducive to Knowledge. Hence, lack of delight in an assembly 
    f common people is Knowledge since it leads to Knowledge.
