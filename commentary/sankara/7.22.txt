<p><i>Yuktah</i>, being endued; <i>taya</i>, with that;
<i>sraddhaya</i>, faith, as granted by Me; <i>sah</i>, that
person; <i>ihate</i>, engages in; <i>radhanam</i>, i.e.
<i>aradhanam</i>, worshipping; <i>tasyah</i>, that form of the
deity. And <i>labhate</i>, he gets; <i>tan hi</i>, those very;
<i>kaman</i>, desired results; <i>tatah</i>, there - from, from that
form of the deity which was worshipped; as
<i>vihitan</i>, they are dispensed, meted out; <i>maya eva</i>,
by Me alone, who am the omniscient, supreme
God, because I am possessed of the knowledge of
the apportionment of the results of actions.</p>

<p>The meaning of this is that he surely gets those desired
results since they are ordained by God. If the
reading be <i>hitan</i> (instead of <i>hi tan</i>), then the
beneficence (<i>hita</i> means beneficent) of the desired
result should be interpreted in a figurative sense,
for desires cannot be beneficial to anyone!</p>
