<i>Sthane</i>, it is proper; What is that? That the <i>jagat</i>, world; <i>prahrsyati</i>, becomes delighted; 
<i>tava prakirtya</i>, by Your praise, by reciting Your greatness and hearing it. This is befitting. This is 
the idea. Or, the word sthane may be taken as qualifying the word 'subject' (understood): It is proper that 
the Lord is the subject of joy etc. since the Lord is the Self of all beings and the Friend of all. So also 
it (the world) <i>anurajyate</i>, becomes attracted, becomes drawn (by that praise). That also is with regard 
to a proper subject. This is how it is to be explained. 

Further, that the <i>raksamsi</i>, Raksasas; <i>bhitani</i>, stricken with fear; <i>dravanti</i>, run; <i>disah</i>, 
in all directions - that also is with regard to a proper subject. And that <i>sarve</i>, all; the <i>siddha sanghah</i>, 
groups of the Siddhas-Kapila and others; <i>namasyanti</i>, bow down - that also is befitting. He points out the 
reason for the Lord's being the object of delight etc. in the next verse.
