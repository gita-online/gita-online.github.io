<p><i>Yatra</i>, at the time when; <i>cittam</i>, the mind;
<i>niruddham</i>, restrained, entirely prevented from
wandering; <i>uparamate</i>, gets withdrawn; <i>yogasevaya</i>,
through the practice of Yoga; <i>ca</i>, and; <i>yatra
eva</i>, just when, at the very moment when; <i>pasyan</i>,
by seeing, by experiencing; <i>atmanam</i>, the Self,
which by nature is the supreme light of
Consciousness; <i>atmana</i>, by the self, by the mind
purified by concentration; <i>tusyati</i>, one remains
contented, gets delighted; <i>atmani eva</i>, in one's own
Self alone.</p>

<p>Samadhi is of two kinds, Samprajnata
and Asamprajnata. The concentration called right
knowledge (<i>Samprajnata</i>) is that which is followed
by reasoning, discrimination, bliss, and
unqualified egoism. Asamprajnata is that which is
attained by the constant practice of cessation of all
mental activity, in which the citta retains only the
unmanifested impressions.</p>
