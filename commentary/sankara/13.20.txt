    <i>Viddhi</i>, know; <i>ubhau</i>, both; <i>prakrtim</i> Nature; and also the <i>purusam</i>, individual soul; 
    these two; Nature and the soul. the aspects of God-to be <i>api</i>, verily; <i>anadi</i>, without beginning. 
    Those two that have no beginning (adi), are anadi. Since the godhood of God is eternal, therefore it is 
    logical that even His aspects also should have eternality. For God's god-hood consists verily in having the 
    two aspects. Those two aspects through which God becomes the cause of creation, continuance and dissolution 
    of the Universe, and which are beginningless, are the sources of mundane existence. Some interpret the 
    phrase anadi in the tatpurusa(*) sense of na adi, not primeval (not cause). (According to them) thereby indeed 
    is established the causality of God. Again, if Nature and soul themselves be eternal, the mundane existence 
    would surely be their creation, and the causality of the mundane existence would not be God's. That is wrong 
    because, there being nothing to rule over before the emergence of Nature and soul, there will arise the contingency 
    of God ceasing to be God! 
</p>

<p>
    And if the mundane state be uncaused, i.e. not caused by Nature and soul, but by God independently of 
    those two aspects, there arises the contingency of the absence of Liberation, the scriptures becoming useless, and 
    the absence of bondage and freedom. If God were. Himself the sole cause of mundane existence, independently 
    of His two aspects, then it would be endless because there would be nothing to prevent liberated souls from being 
    put under bondage again. On the other hand, all these become justifiable if God and the two aspects be eternal.

    How? <i>Viddhi</i>, know; the <i>vikaran</i>, modifications that will be spoken of the intellect etc., the body 
    and the organs; <i>ca eva</i>, as also; <i>gunan</i>, the qualities (sattva etc.) - manifest in the form of the 
    mental states of happiness, sorrow and attachment; as <i>prakriti-sambhavan</i>, born of Nature. Nature, Maya, 
    is the power of God, which is the cause of the modifications and which consists of the three qualities. 
    Those modifications and qualities, which have that Nature as their source, know those modifications and qualities 
    as 'born of Nature', as transformations of Nature. Which again, are those modifications and qualities born of Nature?

<p>That is answered in the next verse.</p>

    * <b>Tatpurusa</b>: Name of a class of compounds in which the first member determines 
    the sense of the other members, or in which the last member is defined or qualified by the first, without 
    losing its original independence.
