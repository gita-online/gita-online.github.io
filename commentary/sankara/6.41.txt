<p><i>Prapya</i>, attaining, reaching, <i>lokan</i>, the worlds;
<i>punya-krtam</i>, of the righteous, of the performers of
the Horse-sacrifice, etc.; and <i>usitva</i>, residing there,
enjoying the stay; for <i>sasvatih</i>, eternal; <i>samah</i>,
years; (then,) when the period of enjoyment is over,
the <i>yoga-bhrastah</i>, man fallen from Yoga, the one
who had set out on the path Yoga, i.e. a monk-as
understood from the force of the context; <i>abhijayate</i>, is born; <i>gehe</i>, in
the house; <i>sucinam</i>, of the pious, who perform
actions according to scriptural instructions; and
<i>srimatam</i>, who are prosperous.</p>

<p>From Arjuna's question it might appear that he was
asking about the fate of people who fall from both
the paths, viz that of Karma and of Meditation. But
the possibility of getting ruined by performing
actions (rites and duties) according to Vedic
instructions does not arise, since their results are
inevitable. However, the question of ruin is
relevant in the case of a monk, for on the one hand
he has renounced actions, and on the other he may
fail to attain perfection in Yoga in the present life.
Hence, the Lord's answer relates to the fall and
ruin of a monk alone.</p>
