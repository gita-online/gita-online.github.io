<i>Bhojanam</i>, food; which is <i>yata-yamam</i>, not properly cooked (Yata-yamam lit. means 'crooked three hours ago', that which has lost its essence; .
but here it is translated as 'not properly cooked to avoid tautology, for the next word gata-rasam, too, means lacking in essence) because food that has lost 
its essence is referred to by the word gatarasam; <i>gata-rasam</i>, lacking in essence; <i>puti</i>, putrid; and <i>paryusitam</i>, stale, cooked on the 
previous day and kept over-night; and even <i>ucchistam</i>, ort, remnants of a meal; and <i>amedhyam</i>, that which is unfit for sacrifice; this kind of 
food is <i>tamasa-priyam</i>, dear to one possessed of tamas. Now then, sacrifices of three kinds are being stated in the next verse.
