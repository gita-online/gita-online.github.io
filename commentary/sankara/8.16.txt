<p><i>O Arjuna</i>, all the <i>lokah</i>, worlds; <i>abrahmabhuvanat</i>,
together with the world of Brahmabhuvana
is that (place) in which creatures are born,
and <i>brahma-bhuvana</i> means the world of Brahma;
<i>punah avartinah</i>, are subject to return, are by
nature liable to come again; <i>Tu</i>, but; <i>kaunteya</i>, O
son of Kunti, <i>na vidyate</i>, there is no; <i>punarjanma</i>,
rebirth; <i>upetya</i>, after reaching; <i>mam</i>, Me alone.
Why are all the worlds together with the realm of
Brahma subject to return? Because they are limited
by time. How? This is explained in the next verse.</p>
