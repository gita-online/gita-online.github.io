    <i>Deva-vratah</i>, votaries of the gods, those whose religious observances 
    and devotion are directed to the gods; <i>yanti</i>, reach, go to; <i>devan</i>, the gods. 
    <i>Pitr-vratah</i>, the votaries of the ancestors, those who are occupied with such 
    rites as obsequies etc., who are devoted to the manes; <i>go pitrn</i>, to the ancestors such 
    as Agnisvatta and others. <i>Bhutejyah</i>, the Beings such as Vinayaka, the group of 
    Sixteen (divine) Mothers, the Four Sisters, and others. And <i>madyajinah</i>, 
    those who worship Me, those who are given to worshipping Me, the devotees of Visnu;

    Although the effort (involved) is the same, still owing to ingorance they do not 
    worship Me exclusively. Thereby they attain lesser results. This is the meaning. 
    'Not only do My devotees get the everlasting result in the form of non-return 
    (to this world), but My worship also is easy.' How? That is answered in the next
    verse.
