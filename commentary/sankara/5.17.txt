<i>Tat-buddhayah</i>, those who have their intellect absorbed in That, in the supreme Knowledge 
which has been revealed; <i>tat-atmanah</i>, whose Self is That, who have That (tat) supreme 
Brahman Itself as their Self (atma); <i>tat-nisthah</i>, who are steadfast in That - nistha is 
intentness, exclusive devotion; they are called tat-nisthah who become steadfast only in 
Brahman by renouncing all actions; and <i>tat-parayanah</i>, who have That as their supreme 
(para) Goal (ayana), who have That alone as their supreme Resort, i.e. who are devoted only 
to the Self; those who have got their ignorance destroyed by Knowledge - those who are of this 
kind, they <i>gacchanti</i>, attain; <i>apunaravrttim</i>, the state of non-returning, 
non-association again with a body; <i>jnana-nirdhuta-kalmasah</i>, their dirt having been 
removed, destroyed, by Knowledge. Those whose dirt (kalmasa), the defect in the form of sin etc., 
which are the cause of transmigration, have been removed, destryed (nirdhuta), by the aforesaid 
Knowledge (jnana) are jnana-nirdhuta kalmasah, i.e. the monks. How do those learned ones, whose 
ignorance regarding the Self has been destroyed by Knowledge, look upon Reality? That is being 
stated in the next verse.
