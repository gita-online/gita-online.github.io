<i>Nirasih</i>, one who is without solicitation - one
from whom asisah, solicitations, have departed;
<i>yata-citta-atma</i>, who has the mind and organs
under control-one by whom have been controlled
(yatau) both the internal organ (citta) and the
external aggregate of body and organs (atma);
(and) is <i>tyakta-sarva-parigrahah</i>, totally without possessions 
- one by whom have been renounced (tyaktah) all (sarvah)
possessions (parigrahah); <i>na apnoti</i>, he does not
incur; <i>kilbisam</i>, sin, in the form of evil as also
rigtheousness - to one aspiring for Liberation, even
righteousness is surely an evil because it brings
bondage; <i>kurvan</i>, by performing; <i>karma</i>, actions; <i>kevalam</i>,
merely; <i>sariram</i>, for the purpose of maintaining the
body-without the idea of agenship even with
regard to these (actions).<br><br>

Further, in the expression,'<i>kevalam sariram karma</i>', 
do the words sariram karma mean 'actions done by the body' or
'actions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body?
Again, what does it matter if by (the words)
sariram karma is meant 'actions done by the body'
or 'actions merely for the purpose of maintaning
the body? The answer is: If by sariram karma is
meant actions done by the body, then it will
amount to a contradiction when the Lord says, 'one does not
incur sin by doing with his body any action meant
for seen or unseen purposes, even though it be
prohibited.' Even if the Lord were to say that 'one
does not incur sin by doing with his body some
scripturally sanctioned action intended to secure a
seen or an unseen end', then there arises the
contingency of His denying something (some evil)
that has not come into being!<br><br>

Further, from the specification, <i>sariram karma kurvan</i> (by doing
actions with the body), and from the use of the
word <i>kevala</i> (only), it will amount to saying that
one incurs sin by performing actions, called
righteous and unrighteous, which can be
accomplished with the mind and speech and which
come within the purview of injunction and
prohibition. Even there, the statement that one
incurs sin by performing enjoined actions through
the mind and speech will involve a contradiction;
even in the case of doing what is prohibited, it will
amount to a mere purposeless restatement of a
known fact. On the other hand, when the sense
conveyed by sariram karma is taken as acctions
merely for the purpose of maintaining the body,
then the implication will be that he does not do any
other work as can be accomplished physically,
orally, or mentally, which are known from
injunctions and prohibitions (of the scriptures) and
which have in view seen or unseen results; while
he appears to people to be working with those very
body (speech) etc. merely for the purpose of
maintaining the body, yet he does not incur sin by
merely making movements of the body etc.,
because from the use of the word kevala, (merely)
it follows that he is devoid of the sense of
agentship implicit in the idea, 'I do.'<br><br>

Since there is no possibility of a person who has reached such a
state incurring evil as suggest by the word sin,
therefore he does not become subject to the evil of
transmigration. That is to say, he certainly becomes
free without any obstacle since he has all his
actions burnt away by the fire of wisdom. This
verse is only a reiteration of the result of full
illumination stated earlier. It becomes faultless by
accepting the interpretation of sariram karma thus.
In the case of the monk who has renounced all
possessions, since owning food etc. meant for the
bare sustenance of the body is absent, therefore it
becomes imperative to beg for alms etc. for the
upkeep of the body. Under this circumstance, by
way of pointing out the means of obtaining food
etc. for the maintenance of the body of a monk as
permitted by the text, 'What comes unasked for,
without forethought and spontaneously...'
(Unasked for: what comes before the monk gets
ready for going out for alms; without forethought:
alms that are not given with abuses, and have not
fallen on the ground, but collected from five or
seven houses without any plan; spontaneously:
alms brought to one spontaneously by devoted
people.) (Bo. Sm. 21. 8. 12) etc., the Lord explains
in the next verse.
