(That person) <i>vimucya</i>, having discarded; <i>ahan-karam</i>, egoism, thinking of the 
body, organs, etc. as the ego; <i>balam</i>, force-which is associated with desire and 
attachment; not the other kind of strength consisting in the fitness of the body etc., 
because being natural it cannot be descarded; <i>darpam</i>, pride, which follows elation 
and leads to transgresson of righteousness-for the Smrti says, 'An elated person becomes 
proud; a proud man transgresses righteousness' (Ap. Dh. Su. 1.13.4); <i>kamam</i>, desire; 
<i>krodham</i>, anger, aversion; <i>parigraham</i>, superfluous possessions-even after 
removing the defects in the organs and the mind, there arises the possibility of 
acceptance of gifts either for the maintenance of the body or for righteous duties; 
discarding them as well, i.e. becoming a mendicant of the param-hamsa class; <i>nirmamah</i>, 
free from the idea of possession, becoming devoid of the idea of 'me' and 'mine' even with 
regard to so much as one's body and life; and for the very same reason, <i>santah</i>, 
serene, withdrawn; the monk who is effortless and steadfast in Knowledge, <i>kalpate</i>, 
becomes fit; <i>brahma-bhuyaya</i>, for becoming One with the Brahman.
