<i>Uddharet</i>, one should save; <i>atmanam</i>, oneself sunk in the sea of the world; <i>atmana</i>, by oneself; one should save, 
<i>ut-haret</i>, should uplift (oneself) from that, i.e. make it attain the state of being established in Yoga. <i>Na avasadayet</i>, 
one should not lower, debase; <i>atmanam</i>, oneself. <i>Hi</i>, for; <i>atma eva</i>, oneself is verily; <i>atmanah</i>, one's own; 
<i>bandhuh</i>, friend.<br><br>

Centainly there is no other friend who can bring about liberation from this world. In fact, even a friend is an obstacle to 
Liberation, he being the source of such bondages as love etc. Therefore the emphatic statement, 'For one is one's own friend, 
is justifiable.<br><br>

<i>Atma eva</i>, oneself verily; is <i>atmanah</i>, one's own: <i>ripuh</i>, enemy.<br><br>

Anyone else who is an external harmful enemy, even he is of one's own making! Therefore the firm conclusion, 'oneself verily is 
one's own enemy's is reasonable. It has been said that 'oneself is verily one's own friend, oneself verily is one's own enemy.' 
As to that, (the self) of what kind is one's own friend, or (the self) of what kind is one's own enemy? This is being answered in
the next verse.
