<p>He is <i>parah</i>, distinct, different; From What?
<i>tasmat</i>, from that aforesaid (Unmanifested). The
word <i>tu</i>, but, is meant for showing the distinction
of the Immutable that is going to be spoken of from
the Unmanifested. He is <i>bhavah</i>, the Reality, the
supreme Brahman called the Immutable. Even
though different, there is the possibility of
similarlity of characteristics.</p>

<p>Hence, for obviating this the Lord says: 
<i>anyah</i>, the other, of a different characteristic, 
and He is the Immutable which is beyond 
the range of the organs. It has been said 
that He is distinct from that. From what, again is
He distinct?</p>

<p><i>Avyaktat</i>, from the Unmaifested spoken 
of earlier, which is the seed of the 
multitude of beings, and which is characterized as
ignorance (avidya). He is <i>sanatnah</i>, eternal.
<i>Bhavah</i>, the Reality; <i>yah sah</i>, who is such; <i>na</i>, does
not; <i>vinasyati</i>, get destroyed; when <i>sarvesu
bhutesu</i>, all beings, beginning from Brahma;
<i>nasyatsu</i>, get destroyed.</p>
