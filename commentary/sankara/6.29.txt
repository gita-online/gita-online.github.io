<p><i>Yoga-yukta-atma</i>, one who has his mind Self-absorbed
through Yoga, whose mind is merged in
samadhi; and <i>sarvatra-sama-darsanah</i>, who has the
vision of sameness everywhere - who has the vision
(darsana) of sameness (sama-tva), the knowledge
of identity of the Self and Brahman everywhere
(sarvatra) without exception, in all divergent
objects beginning from Brahma to immovable
things; <i>iksate</i>, sees; <i>atmanam</i>, the Self, his own Self;
<i>sarva-bhuta-stham</i>, existing in everything; and
<i>sarva-bhutani</i>, everything from Brahma to a clump
of grass; unified <i>atmani</i>, in his Self. The fruit of this
realization of the unity of the Self is being stated in the
next verse.</p>
