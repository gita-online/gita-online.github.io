<p>Api, even; <i>sarvesam yoginam</i>, among all the
yogis, among those who are immersed in
meditation on Rudra, Aditya, and others; yah, he
who; <i>bhajate</i>, adores; <i>mam</i>, Me; <i>antaratmana</i>, with
his mind; <i>madgatena</i>, fixed on Me, concentrated on
Me who am Vasudeva; and <i>sraddhavan</i>, with faith,
becoming filled with faith; sah, he; is <i>matah</i>,
considered; <i>me</i>, by Me; to be <i>yukta-tamah</i>, the best
of the yogis, engaged in Yoga most intensely.</p>

<p>It has been shown thus far that Karma-yoga has
monasticism as its ultimate culmination. And in
the course of expounding Dhyana-yoga together
with its auxiliaries, and instructing about the
means to control the mind, the Lord rules out the
possibility of absolute ruin for a person fallen from
Yoga. He has also stated that steadfastness in
Knowledge is for a man who knows the meaning
of the word <i>tvam</i> (thou) (in 'Thou are That'). All
these instructions amount to declaring that
Liberation comes from the knowledge of the great
Upanisadic saying, 'Thou art That.'</p>
