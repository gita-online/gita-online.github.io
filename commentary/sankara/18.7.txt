    Therefore, <i>sannyasah</i>, the abandoning; <i>niyatasya tu karmanah</i>, of the daily obligatory 
    acts, by the seeker of Liberation who is as yet unenlightened and is fit for rites and duites; 
    <i>na apapadyate</i>, is not justifiable, because what is desired is the purification of unenlightened 
    persons. <i>Parityagah</i>, giving up; <i>tasya</i>, of that, of the daily obligatory duty; 
    <i>mohat</i>, through delusion, through ignorance; <i>parikirtitah</i>, is declared; to be 
    <i>tamasah</i>, based on tamas.

<p>
    Niyata is that duty which must be performed. That an act is niyata (obligatory) and it is relinquished 
    is contradictory.Therefore the giving up of that through delusion is declared to be based on 
    tamas, for delusion is tamas.
