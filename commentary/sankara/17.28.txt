O son of Prtha, whatever is <i>hutam</i>, offered in sacrifice, poured as oblation; and <i>dattam</i>, given in charity to the Priests, without faith; whatever 
<i>tapah</i>, austerity; is <i>taptam</i>, performed without faith; so also, whatever is <i>krtam</i>, done without faith, e.g. praise, salutation, etc.; all that 
<i>ucyate</i>, is said to be; <i>asat iti</i>, of no avail, since it is outside the course of discipline leading to Me. <i>Ca</i>, and, although involving great effort; 
<i>na ca tat</i>, it is of no consequence; <i>pretya</i>, after death, for producing (some) result; <i>na</i>, nor even for any result; <i>iha</i>, because it is 
condemned by the wise.
