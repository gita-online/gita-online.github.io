pure, conscious and free; <i>udahrtah</i>, spoken of in the Upanisads; <i>iti</i>, as; the <i>paramatma</i>, supreme Self; He is <i>paramah</i>, supreme, as compared 
with the selves like body etc. created by ignorance, and is the atma, Self, the inmost Consciousness of all beings. Hence He is the supreme Self. He Himself is 
being specially described: <i>yah</i>, who, by dint of His own active power inhering in the energy that is Maya; <i>avisya</i>, permeating; <i>loka-trayam</i>, the 
three worlds-called Bhuh (Earth), <i>Bhuvah</i>, (Intermediate Space) and Svah (Heaven); <i>bibharti</i>, upholds (them) by merely being present in His own nature.

God as described is well known. Showing that the name is apt by virtue of its etymological significance, the Lord reveals Himself saying, 'I am the unsurpassable God'
in the next verse.
