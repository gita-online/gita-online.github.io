<p>
    <i>Yah</i>, he who; <i>vetti</i>, knows; <i>mam</i>, Me; <i>ajam</i>, the birthless; and 
    <i>anadim</i>, the beginningless: Since I am the source of the gods and the great sages, 
    and nothing else exists as My origin, therefore I am birthless and beginningless. 
    Being without an origin is the cause of being birthless. He who knows Me who am thus 
    birthless and beginningless, and <i>loka-maheswaram</i>, the great Lord of the worlds, 
    the transcendental One devoid of ignorance and its effects; <i>sah</i>, he; the 
    <i>asammudhah</i>, undeluded one; <i>martyesu</i>, among mortals, among human beings; 
    <i>pramucyate</i>, becomes freed; <i>sarva-papaih</i>, from all sins committed knowingly 
    or unknowingly. 'For the following reason also I am the great Lord of the worlds:' (the
    reason is stated in the next verse).
