    <i>Tat</i>, That-the Knowable; <i>sarvatah-pani</i> padam, which has hands and feet everywhere. The 
    existence of the Knower of the field is revealed through the adjuncts in the form of the organs of all 
    creatures. And the Knower of the field is spoken of as such because of the limiting adjuncts of the 
    field.

<p>
    The field, too, is diversely differentiated as hands, feet, etc. All diversity in the Knower of the 
    field, caused by the differences in the adjunct-the field, is certainly unreal. Hence, by denying it, 
    the nature of the Knowable has been stated, in, 'That is called neither being nor non-being.' Although 
    the unreal form is caused by the limiting adjuncts, still, for the comprehension of Its existence it 
    is said, '(It) has hands and feet everywhere, etc., by assuming this as a quality of the Knowable. Thus, 
    as is well known, there is saying of the people versed in tradition, 'The Transcendental is described 
    with the help of superimposition and its refutation'. Everywhere the hands, feet, etc., which are 
    perceived as limbs of all bodies, perform, their duties due to the presence of the power of the Knowable 
    (Brahman). Thus the grounds for the inference of the existence of the Knowable are metaphorically spoken 
    of as belonging to the Knowable. The others have to be explained similarly. That Knowable has hands and feet 
    everwhere.

<p>
    That which has eyes, heads, and mouths everywhere is <i>sarvatoksi-siro-mukham</i>. That which has 
    ears every-where is <i>sarvatah-srutimat</i>: sruti means the organs of hearing; that which has it is 
    sruti-mat. <i>Tisthati</i>, It exists, remains established; <i>loke</i>, in the multititude of creatures; 
    <i>avrtya</i>, by pervading; <i>sarvam</i>, them all. With this purpose is view, that as a result of 
    the superimposition of the organs like hands, feet, etc., which are adjuncts, there may not be 
    the misconception that the Knowable is possessed of them (adjuncts), the (next) verse is begun.
