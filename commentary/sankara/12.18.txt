<i>Samah</i>, who is the same; <i>satrau ca mitre</i>, towards friend and foe; <i>ca tatha</i>, and so also; <i>mana apamanayoh</i>, in honour 
and dishonour, in adoration and humiliation; who is the same <i>sita usna-sukha-duhkhesu</i>, under cold, heat, happiness and sorrow; and 
<i>sanga-vivar-jitah</i>, free from attachment to everything.
