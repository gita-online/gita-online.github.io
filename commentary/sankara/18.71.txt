    <i>Yah narah</i>, any man who; being <i>sraddhavan</i>, reverential; and <i>anasuyah</i>, free 
    from cavilling; <i>srnuyat api</i>, might even hear this text-the word even suggests that one 
    who knows the meaning (of the Scripture) hardly needs to be mentioned; <i>sah api</i>, he too; 
    becoming <i>muktah</i>, free from sin; <i>prapnuyat</i>, shall attain; <i>subhan</i>, the 
    blessed, auspicious; <i>lokan</i>, worlds; <i>punya-karmanam</i>, of those who perform virtuous 
    deeds, of those who perform rites like Agnihotra etc.

    In order to ascertain whether or not the disciple has comprehended the meaning of the Scripture, 
    the Lord asks (the following question), the intention of the questioner beings, 'If it is known 
    that it has not been comprehended, I shall again make him grasp it through other means.' Hereby 
    is shown the duty of the teacher that a student should be made to achieve his goal by taking 
    the help of a different method.
