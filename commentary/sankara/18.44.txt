<i>Svabyavajam</i>, the natural; <i>vaisya-karma</i>, duties of the Vaisyas, of the Merchants; are 
<i>krsi gauraksyavanijyam</i>, agriculture, cattle rearing and trade: Krsi is tilling of land. Orre who rears 
cattle (go) is goraksa; the abstract form of that word is gauraksyam, animal-husbandry. Vanijyam means the 
occupation of a trader, consisting of buying and selling. <i>Sudrasya</i>, of the Sudra; <i>api</i>, too; 
<i>svabhavajam</i>, the natural; <i>karma</i>, duty; is <i>paricaryatmakam</i>, in the form of service. 
When rightly pursued, the natural result of these duties enjoined for the castes is the attainment of heaven 
which act is evident from such Smrti texts as, 'People belonging to the castes and stages of life, who are .
true to their own duties, experience after death the fruit of their actions. And after that, as a result of 
the remnants of their merits they are born in some excellent region, caste and family, with greater piety, 
longevity, learning, conduct, wealth, happiness and intelligence' (Ap. Dh. Su. 2.2.2.3), etc. And in the 
Puranas also it is particularly mentioned that poeple belonging to the (different) varnas and stages of life 
come to have specific results in the form of different worlds. But this result that is going to be stated 
follows from a different cause in the next verse.
