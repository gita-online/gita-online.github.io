    O mighty-armed Hrsikesa, <i>kesi-nisudana</i>, O slayer of (the demon) Kesi; <i>icchami</i>, 
    I want; <i>veditum</i>, to know; <i>prthak</i>, severally, through their mutual distinctions; 
    <i>tattvam</i>, the truth, the intrinsic nature, i.e. the real meaning; <i>sannyasasya</i>, 
    of sannyasa, i.e. the meaning of the word sannyasa, <i>ca</i>, as also; <i>tyagasya</i>, of 
    tyaga, i.e. the meaning of the word tyaga.

<p>
    Kesi was a demon who had assumed the form of a horse, and Lord Vasudeva had killed him. 
    Hence He is addressed by that name (Kesi-nisudana) by Arjuna. The word sannyasa and tyaga, 
    used in various places in the preceding chapters, are not explicit in their implications. 
    Therefore, in order to determine them for Arjuna who had put the question, the Lord says
    the next verse.
