<p><i>Hi</i>, for; O <i>Krsna</i>, the word <i>krsna</i> is derived from the root <i>krs</i>, 
in the sense of 'uprooting'; He is Krsna because He
uproots the defects such as sin of devotees;
<i>manah</i>, the mind; is <i>cancalam</i>, unsteady. Not only
is it very unsteady, it is also <i>pramathi</i>, turbulent. It
torments, agitates, the body and the organs. It
brings them under extraneous control. Besides, it is
<b>balavat</b>, strong, not amenable to anybody's
restraint. Again, it is <b>drdham</b>, obstinate, hard as the
(large shark called) Tantu-naga (also known as
Varjuna-pasa). <i>Aham</i>, I; <i>manye</i>, consider; <i>tasya</i>, of
the mind which is of this kind; <i>nigrahah</i>, control,
restraint; to be <i>suduskaram</i>, greatly difficult;
<b>vayoh iva</b>, as of the wind. Control of the wind is
difficult. I consider the control of the mind to be
even more difficult than that.</p>
