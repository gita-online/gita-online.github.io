Should the <i>bhah</i>, effulgence; <i>surya sahasrasya</i>, of a thousand suns; <i>utthita bhavet</i>, 
blaze forth; <i>yugapat</i>, simultaneously; <i>divi</i>, in the sky, or in heaven which is the third as 
counted (from this earth); <i>sa</i>, that; <i>yadi syat</i>, might be - or it might not be; <i>sadrsi</i>, 
similar; to the <i>bhasah</i>, radiance; <i>tasya</i>, of that; <i>mahat-manah</i>, exalted One, the Cosmic 
Person Himself. The idea is that the brillinace of the Cosmic Person surely excels even this!
