<p><i>Yogah bhavati</i>, Yoga becomes; <i>duhkha-ha</i>, a
destroyer of sorrow - that which destroys (hanti) all
sorrows (duhkhani), i.e., Yoga destroys all worldly
sorrows; <i>yukta-ahara-viharasya</i>, of one whose
eating and movements are regulated - <i>ahara</i> (lit.
food) means all that is gathered in,
and <i>vihara</i> means moving about, walking; one for
whom these two are regulated (yukta) is <i>yukta-ahara-
vihara</i>; and also <i>yukta-cestasya</i>, of one
whose effort (<i>cesta</i>) is moderate (yukta); <i>karmasu</i>,
in works; similarly, <i>yukta-svapna-avabodhasya</i>, of
one whose sleep (<i>svapna</i>) and wakefulness
(<i>avabodha</i>) are temperate (yukta), have regulated
periods.</p>

<p>To him whose eating and movements are
regulated, whose effort in work is moderate, whose
sleep and wakefulness are temperate, Yoga
becomes a destroyer of sorrows. When does a man
become concentrated? That is being presently
stated in the next verse.</p>
