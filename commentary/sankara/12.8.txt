<i>Adhatsva</i>, fix <i>manah</i>, the mind-possessed of the power of thinking and doubting; <i>mayi</i>, on Me, on 
God as the Cosmic Person; <i>eva</i>, alone. <i>Mayi</i>, in Me; <i>eva</i>, alone; <i>nivesaya</i>, rest; the <i>buddhim</i>, 
intellect, which engages in determining (things). Listen to what will happen to you thereby: <i>Na samsayah</i>, there is no doubt - 
no doubt should be entertained with regard to this; that <i>atah urdhvam</i>, hereafter, after the fall of the body; <i>nivasisyasi</i>, 
you will dwell; <i>mayi</i>, in Me, live in identity with Me; <i>eva</i>, alone.
