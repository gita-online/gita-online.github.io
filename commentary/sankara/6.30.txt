<p><i>Yah</i>, one who; <i>pasyati</i>, sees; <i>mam</i>, Me,
Vasudeva, who am the Self of all; <i>sarvatra</i>, in all
things; <i>ca</i>, and; sees <i>sarvam</i>, all things, all created
things, beginning from Brahma; <i>mayi</i>, in Me who
am the Self of all; <i>aham</i>, I who am God; <i>na
pranasyami</i>, do not go out; <i>tasya</i>, of his vision - of
one who has thus realized the unity of the Self; <i>ca</i>
and he also; <i>na pranasyati</i>, is not lost; <i>me</i>, to
My vision. That man of realization does not get lost
to Me, to Vasudeva, because of the indentity
between him and Me, for that which is called one's
own Self is surely dear to one, and since it is I alone
who am the seer of the unity of the Self in all.</p>
