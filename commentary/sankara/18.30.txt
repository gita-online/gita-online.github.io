    O Partha, <i>sa</i>, that; <i>buddhih</i>, intellect; is <i>sattviki</i>, born of sattva; <i>ya</i>, which; 
    <i>vetti</i>, understands; <i>pravrttim</i>, action, the path of rites and duties, which is the cause of 
    bondage; and <i>nivrttim</i>, withdrawal, the path of renunciation, which is the cause of Liberation - since 
    action and withdrawal are mentioned in the same sentence along with bondage and freedom, therefore they mean 
    'the path of rites and duties and of renunciation'; <i>karya-akarye</i>, duty and what is not duty, i.e. 
    what is enjoined or prohibited, what ought to be done or ought not to be done, action and inaction. With 
    regard to what? With regard to action leading to seen or unseen, results, undertaken according to place, 
    time, etc.

<p>
    <i>Bhaya adhaye</i>, the sources of fear and fearlessness, i.e. the cuases of fear and fearlessness, with 
    regard to seen or unseen objects; <i>bandham</i>, bondage, along with its cause; and <i>moksam</i>, freedom, 
    along with its cause. In this context, knowing is a function of the intellect; but the intellect is the 
    possesser of the function. Fortitude also is only a particular function of the intellect.
