    <i>Mahabhutani</i>, the great elements: Those elements which are great owing to their pervasion of all 
    midifications, and which are subtle. As for the gross elements, they will be spoken of by the word 
    <i>indriya-gocarah</i>, objects of the senses. <i>Ahankarah</i>, egoism, which is the source of the 
    great elements and consists of the idea of 'I'. <i>Buddhih</i>, intellect, the source of egoism and 
    consisting of the faculty of judgement; <i>ca</i>, and; its cause, the <i>avyaktam eva</i>, Unmanifest 
    itself, the Undifferentiated, the power of God spoken of in, 'Maya of Mine...difficult to cross' (7.14).

    The word eva (itself) is used for singling out Prakrti (Nature). The Prakrti divided eightfold 
    is this much alone. The word ca (and) is used for joining the various categories. The <i>dasa</i>, ten; 
    <i>indriyani</i>, organs : The five, organs ear etc., which are called sense-organs since they produce 
    perception, and the (other) five organs-organ of speech, hands, etc. which are called motor-organs since 
    they accomplish actions.

<p>
    They are ten. <i>Ekam ca</i>, and the one-which is that? The mind, the eleventh, possessed of the power 
    of thinking etc. (see fn. on p. 173). <i>Ca</i>, and; the <i>panca</i>, five; <i>indriya-gacarah</i>, 
    objects of the senses-such objects as sound etc. The followers of the Sankhya call these which are such 
    the twenty-four categories. Thereafter, the Lord now says that even those qualities which the Vaisesikas 
    speak of as the attributes of the sould are certainly the attributes of the field, but not of the Knower 
    of the field in the next verse.
