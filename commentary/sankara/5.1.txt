O Krsna, <i>samsasi</i>, You praise, i.e. speak of; <i>sannyasam</i>, renunciation; <i>karmanam</i>, of actions, 
of performance of various kinds of rites enjoined by the scriptures; punah ca, and again; You praise <i>yogam</i>, 
yoga, the obligatory performance of those very rites! Therefore I have a doubt as to which is better - Is the 
performance of actions better, or their rejection? And that which is better should be undertaken. And hence, 
<i>bruhi</i>, tell; mam, me; suniscitam, for certain, as the one intended by You; tat ekam, that one - one of the two, 
since performance of the two together by the same person is impossible; <i>yat</i>, which; is <i>sreyah</i>, better, 
more commendable; <i>etayoh</i>, between these two, between the renunciation of actions and the performance of 
actions, by undertaking which you think I shall acquire what is beneficial.<br><br>
