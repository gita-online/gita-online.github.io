    <i>Maya</i>, under Me; <i>adhyaksena</i>, as the supervisor, remaining changeless as 
    a mere witness under all circumstances; <i>prakrtih</i>, the Prakrti, My maya 
    consisting of the three gunas and characterized as ignorance; <i>suyate</i>, produces; 
    the world <i>sa-cara-acaram</i>. of the moving and the none moving things. Thus 
    there is the Vedic text, 'The one divine Being is hidden in all beings; He is 
    omnipresent, the indwelling Self of all bengs, the Supervisor of actions, the refuge 
    of all beings, the witness, the one who imparts consceiousness, unconditioned and without 
    qualities' (Sv. 6.11).

    <i>Anena hetuna</i>, owing to this reason - because of this presiding over; O son of 
    Kunti, the <i>jagat</i>, world, with the moving and the non-moving things, 
    consisting of the manifest and the unmanifest; <i>viparivartate</i>, revolves, 
    under all conditions. All the activities of the world in the form, 'I eat this; 
    I see; I hear this; I experience this happiness, suffer this sorrow; I shall do 
    this for that purpose, I shall do this for this purpose; I shall know this,' etc. 
    indeed arise owing to their being the objects of the conscious witness.

    They verily exist in consciousness, and end in consciousness. And such mantras 
    as, 'He who is  the witness of this is in the supreme heaven', reveal this 
    fact. Since it follows from this that there is no other conscious being part 
    from the one Deity-who is the witness of all as the absolute Consciousness, 
    and who in reality has no contact with any kind of enjoyment-, therefore there 
    is no other enjoyer. Hence, in this context, the question, 'For what purpose
    is this creation?', and its answer are baseless-in accordance with the Vedic
    text, 'Who know (It) truly, who can fully speak about this here? From where 
    has this come? From where is this variegated creation?' (Rg. 3.54.5; 10.129.6).
    And it has been pointed out by the Lord also: 'Knowledge remains covered 
    by ignorance. Thereby the creatures become deluded' (5.15).
