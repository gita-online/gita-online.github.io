And further, <i>tat</i>, that; <i>jneyam</i>, Knowable; though <i>avibhaktam</i>, undivided, remaining the 
same in all beings like space; <i>iva sthitam</i>, appears to be existing; as <i>vibhaktam</i>, divided; 
<i>bhutesu</i>, in all beings, because It is perceived as existing in the bodies themselves. And just as 
a rope etc. are with regard to a snake etc. That are falsely imagined, similarly that Knowable is 
<i>bhutabhartr</i>, the sustainer of all beings, sinced It sustains all during the period of their 
existence; <i>grasisnu</i>, the devourer, at the time of dissolution; and <i>prabhavisnu</i>, the 
originator, at the time of creation. Further, it the Knowable is not perceived though existing everywhere, 
then It is darkness? Not! What then?
