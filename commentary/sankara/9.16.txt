<i>Aham</i>, I; am the <i>kratuh</i>, a kind of Vedic sacrifice; I Myself am the 
<i>yajnah</i>, sacrifice as prescribed by the Smrtis; further, I am <i>svadha</i>, 
the food that is offered to the manes; I am <i>ausadham</i> by which word is meant 
the food that is eaten by all creatures. 

Or, svadha means food in general of all creatures, and ausadha means medicine for 
curing diseases. I am the mantra with which offering is made to manes and gods. 
I Myself am the <i>ajyam</i>, oblations; and I am <i>agnih</i>, the fire - I Myself 
am the fire into which the oblation is poured. And I am the <i>hutam</i>, act of offering.
