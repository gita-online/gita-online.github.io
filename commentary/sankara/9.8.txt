    Thus <i>avastabhya</i>, keeping under control; <i>svam</i>, My own; <i>prakrtim</i>, 
    Prakrti, which is charcterized as nescience; <i>visrjami</i>, I project forth; 
    <i>punah-punah</i>, again and again; the <i>krtsnam</i>, whole of; <i>imam</i>, this; 
    existing <i>bhuta-gramam</i>, multitude of beings which are born of Prakrti; which, 
    being under another's sub-jugation due to such defects as ignorance etc., are <i>avasam</i>, 
    powerless, not independent; <i>prakrteh vasat</i>, under the influence of their own 
    nature.

<p>
    'In that case, You, who are the supreme God and who ordain this multitude of beings 
    unequally, will become associated with virtue and vice as a result of that act?'

<p>In answer the Lord says the next verse.</p>
