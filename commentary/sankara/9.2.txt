    And that is <i>raja-vidya</i>, the Sovereign Knowledge, the kind among sciences because of the 
    abundance of its radiance. Indeed, this knowledge of Brahman shines most brilliantly 
    among all kiinds of learning. So also, <i>idam</i>, this; is <i>raja-guhyam</i>, the 
    Sovereign Profundity, the kind among profundities; <i>uttamam</i>, the best; <i>pavitram</i>, 
    sanctifier. This knowledge of Brahman, which sanctifies all things that purify, is the 
    greatest. Shine it reduces to ashes in a moment (the results of) all actions-righteous, 
    unrighteous and others together with their roots, accumulated over many thousands of 
    births, therefore, what to speak of its sanctifying power!

    Besides, it is <i>pratyaksavagamam</i>, directly realizable, directly perceivable like 
    happiness etc. Even though possessed of many qualities, a thing may be noticed to be 
    contrary to righteousness. The knowledge of the Self is not opposed to righteousness, 
    in that way, but it is <i>dharmyam</i>, righteous, not divorced from righteousness. 
    Eeve so, it may be difficult to practice. Hence the Lord says it is <i>susukham</i>, 
    very easy; kartum to practise, like the knowledge of the distinction among jewels.

    It is seen (in the world) that, actions which require little effort and are accomplished 
    easily yield meagre results, whereas those that are difficult to accomplish yield great 
    results. Thus the contingency arises that this (knowledge of Brahman), however. which is 
    easily attained, perishes when its result gets exhausted. Therefore the Lord says it is 
    <i>avyayam</i>, imperishable. From the point of view of its result, it is not perishable 
    like (the results of) actions. Hence the knowledge of the Self should be highly regarded.
