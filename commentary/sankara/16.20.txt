<i>Apannah</i>, being born, having acquired; (births) <i>asurim</i>, among the demoniacal; <i>yonim</i>, species; <i>janmani janmani</i>, in births after births; 
the <i>mudhah</i>, fools, non-discriminating ones; being born in every birth into species in which tamas prevails, and going downwards, <i>aprapya eva</i>, 
without ever reaching, approaching; <i>mam</i>, Me, who am God; O son of Kunti, yanti, they attain; <i>gatim</i>, conditions; <i>tatah adhamam</i>, lower even than that. 
Since there is not the least possibility of attaining Me, what is implied by saying, 'without ever reachin Me', is, 'by not attaining the virtuous path enjoined 
by Me.' This is being stated as a summary of all the demoniacal qualities. The triplet-under which are comprehended all the different demoniacal qualities though 
they are infinite in number, (and) by the avoidance of which (three) they (all the demaniacal qualities) become rejected, and which is the root of all evils- is 
being stated in the next verse.
