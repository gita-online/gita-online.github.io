    O son of Kunti, <i>yat-karosi</i>, whatever you do, what comes spontaneously; 
    <i>yad-asnasi</i>, whatever you eat; and <i>yat-juhosi</i>, whatever you offer 
    as a sacrifice, whatever sacrifices you perform - be it prescribed by the Vedas 
    or by the Smrtis; <i>yatadadasi</i>, whatever you give - gold, food, clarified butter, 
    etc. to Priests and others; and <i>yat-tapasyasi</i>, whatever austerties you 
    undertake; (all) <i>tat</i>, that; <i>kurusva madarpanam</i>, you offer to Me. 
</p>

<p>'Hear what happens to you when you act thus.'</p>
