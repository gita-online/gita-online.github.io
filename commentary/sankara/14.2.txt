    <i>Agatah</i>, those who attain; <i>mama sadharmyam</i>, identity with Me the supreme God, unity with My real nature-sadharmyam, however, 
    does not mean similarity of attributes, for, in the scripture Gita, distinction between the Knower of the field and God is not admitted; 
    and this statement of the result is by way of eulogy; <i>upasritya</i>, by resorting to i.e. by following; <i>idam</i>, this; <i>jnanam</i>, 
    Knowledge as described, i.e., by following the means to Knowledge; <i>na</i>, are not; <i>upajayante</i>, born, produced; <i>api</i>, even; 
    <i>sarge</i>, during creation; nor do they <i>vyathanti</i>, suffer pain, i.e. they do not perish; <i>pralaye</i>, during dissolution, when even 
    Brahma perishes.

<p>The Lord says that association of this kind between the field and the Knower of the field is the origin of all beings in the next verse.</p>
