are pious in actions, and are <i>sukrtinah</i>, of virtuous
deeds; <i>bhajante</i>, adore; <i>mam</i>, Me; <i>artah</i>, the
afflicted-one who is overcome by sorrow, who is in
distress, being overwhelmed by thieves, tigers, disease, 
etc.; <i>jijnasuh</i>, the seeker of Knowledge, who wants to
know the reality of the Lord; <i>artharthi</i>, the seeker
of wealth; and <i>jnani</i>, the man of Knowledge, who knows
