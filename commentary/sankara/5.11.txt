Since <i>tyaktva</i>, by giving up sangam, attachment with regard to 
results; <i>yoginah</i>, the yogis, men of action; <i>kurvanti</i>, 
undertake; <i>karma</i>, work; <i>kevalaih</i>, merely - this word is to 
be construed with each of the words, body etc., so as to deny the idea of 
ownership with regard to all actions; <i>kayena</i>, through the body; 
<i>manasa</i>, through the mind; <i>buddhya</i>, through the intellect; 
and <i>api</i>, even; <i>indriyaih</i>, through the organs, which are 
devoid of the idea of ownership, which are unassociated with ownership 
thus: 'I act only for God, and not for my gain'; <i>atmasudhaye</i>, for 
the purification of themselves, i.e., for the purification of the heart, 
therefore you have competence only for that. So you undertake action alone.
