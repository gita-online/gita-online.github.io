    <i>Api</i>, even; <i>ye</i>, those who; <i>anya-devata bhaktah</i>, being devoted to 
    to other deities; and <i>anvitah sraddhaya</i>, endowed with faith; <i>yajante</i>, 
    worship (them), <i>te api</i>, they also; O son of Kunti, <i>yajanti</i>, worship; 
    <i>mam</i>, Me; <i>eva</i>, alone; (though) <i>avidhi-purvakam</i>, following the 
    wrong method.

<p>
    Avidhi implies ignorance. So the idea is that they worship (Me) ignorantly. 
    'How it is that they worship (Me) ignorantly?' i.e. the worshippers of other 
    deities worship them knowingly, and hence, how can the question of their ignorance arise? 
    This is being answered in the next verse.
