    <i>Moghasah</i>, of vain hopes. So also, <i>mogha karmanah</i>, of vain actions: 
    their rites, such as Agnihotra etc. which are undertaken by them, verily become 
    vain, fruitless actions, because of dishonouring the Lord, disregarding Him who 
    is their own Self. In this way they are of vain actions. Similarly, 
    <i>mogha-jnanah</i>, of vain knowledge: of fruitless knowledge; even their 
    knowledge verily becomes useless. And <i>vicetasah</i>, senseless: i.e., they 
    lose their power of discrimination.

    Besides, they become <i>sritah</i>, possessed of; the <i>mohinim</i>, self-deceptive, 
    self delusive; <i>prakritim</i>, disposition; <i>raksasim</i>, of fiends; and 
    <i>asurim</i>, of demons - according to which the body is the Self; i.e., they 
    become habitually inclined to act cruelly, saying, 'cut, break, drink, eat, steal 
    others' wealth,' etc. This is stated in the Sruti, 'Those worlds of 
    devils (are covered by blinding darkness)' (Is. 3).
