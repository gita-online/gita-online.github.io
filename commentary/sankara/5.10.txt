On the other hand, again, one who is ignorant of the Truth and is engaged in 
Karma-yoga, <i>yah</i>, who; <i>karoti</i>, acts; <i>adhaya</i>, by 
dedicating, by surrendering; all <i>karmani</i>, actions; <i>brahmani</i>, 
to Brahman, to God; with the idea, 'I am working for Him, as a servant does 
everything for his master', and <i>tyaktva</i>, by renouncing; <i>sangam</i>, 
attachment, even with regard to teh resulting Liberation; <i>sah</i>, he; 
<i>na lipyate</i>, does not get polluted, is not affected; <i>papena</i>, 
by sin; <i>iva</i>, just as; <i>padma-patram</i>, a lotus leaf; is not 
<i>ambhasa</i>, by water.<br>,br>

The only result that will certainly accrue from such action will be the 
purification of the heart.
