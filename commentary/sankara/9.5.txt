<i>Na ca bhutani</i>, nor do the beings, beginning from Brahma; <i>matsthani</i>, 
dwell in Me. <i>Pasya</i>, behold; <i>me</i>, My; <i>aisvaram</i>, divine; <i>yogam</i>, 
Yoga, action, performance, i.e. this real nature of Myself. 

<p>
    The Upanisadic text, too, similarly shows the absence of association (of the Self) 
    due to Its being free from contact: '...unattached, for It is never attached' 
    (Br. 3.9.26). 
</p>

<p>
    Behold this other wonder: I am the <i>bhuta-bhrt</i>, sustainer of beings, 
    though I am unattached. <i>Ca</i>, but; <i>mama atma</i>, My Self; <i>na bhutasthah</i>, 
    is not contained in the bengs. 
</p>

<p>
    As it has been explained according to the logic stated above, there is no possibility 
    of Its remaining contained in beings. How, again, is it said, 'It is My Self? 
    Following human understanding, having separated the aggregate of body etc. (from the Self) 
    and superimposing eoism of them, the Lord calls It 'My Self'. But not that He has said 
    so by ignorantly thinking like ordinary mortals that the Self is different from Himself. 
</p> 

<p>
    I am the <i>bhuta bhavanah</i>, originator of beings, one who gives birth to or 
    nourishes the beings. By way of establishing with the help of an illustration the 
    subject-matter dealt with in the aforesaid two verses, the Lord says the next verse.
