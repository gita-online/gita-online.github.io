O Arjuna, <i>yatha</i>, as; a <i>samiddhah</i>, blazing; <i>agnih</i>, fire, a well lighted fire; <i>kurute</i>, reduces; 
<i>edhamsi</i>, pieces of wood; <i>bhasmasat</i>, to ashes; <i>tatha</i>, similarly; <i>jnanagnih</i>, the fire of Knowledge 
Knowledge itself being the fire; <i>kurute</i>, reduces; <i>bhasmasat</i>, to ashes; <i>sarva-karmani</i>, all actions, i.e. 
it renders them ineffective, for the fire of Knowledge itself cannot directly burn actions to ashes, like pieces of wood. 
Knowledge destroys ignorance, and thereby the idea of agentship is eradicated. This in turn makes actions impossible.
So, the idea implied is that full enlightenment is the cuase of making all actions impotent. From the force the context it 
follows that, since the result of actions owing to which the present body has been born has already become effective, 
therefore it gets eshausted only through experiencing it. If the body were to die just with the dawn of Knowledge, 
imparting of Knowledge by enlightened persons would be impossible, and thus there would be no teacher to transmit Knowledge! 
Hence, Knowledge reduces to ashes only all those actions that were done (in this life) prior to the rise of Knowledge and that 
have not become effective, as also those performed along with (i.e. after the dawn of) Knowledge, and those that were done in 
the many past lives.
