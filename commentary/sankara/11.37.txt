    <i>Ca</i>, and; since You are the Primal Creator, the Cause, <i>api</i>, even; <i>brahmanah</i>, of Brahma, of 
    Hiranyagarbha; therefore, <i>kasmat</i>, why, for what reason; should they <i>na nameran</i>, not bow down; <i>te</i>, 
    to You; <i>mahatman</i>, O exalted One; <i>gariyase</i>, who are greater (than all)! 
</p>

<p>
    Hence, why should these not bow down adi-karte, to the first Creator? Therefore You are fit for, i.e. the fit object 
    of, delight etc. and salutation as well.

<p>
    <i>Ananta</i>, O infinite One; <i>devesa</i>, supreme God; <i>jagannivasa</i>, Abode of the Universe; <i>tvam</i>, You; 
    are the <i>aksaram</i>, Immutable; <i>tat param yat</i>, that which is Transcendental, which is heard of in the 
    Upanisads; What is that? <i>sad-asat</i>, being and nonbeing. Being is that which exists, and non-being is that 
    with regard to which the idea of nonexistence arises. (You are) that Immutable of which these two-being and 
    non-being-become the limiting adjuncts; which (Immutable), as a result, is metaphorically referred to as being 
    and non-being. But in reality that Immutable is transcendental to being and non-being. 
</p>

<p>
    'That Immutable which the knowers of the Vedas declare' (8.11; cf. Ka. 1.2.15) - that is You Yourself, nothing else. 
    This is the idea. He praises again in the next verse.
