<i>Dvau</i>, two, in number; are the (kinds of) <i>bhuta-sargau</i>, creation of beings, of men. Sarga is derived from srj in the sense of that which is created. 
The persons themselves, who are created with the natures of gods and demons, are being spoken of as 'two creations of beings', which accords with the Upanisadic text, 
'There were two classes of Prajapati's sons, the gods and the demons' (Br. 1.3.1). For, <i>asmin</i>, in this; <i>loke</i>, world, all (persons) can rationally be 
divided into two classes. 

Which are those two creations of beings? The answer is, the two are the <i>daiva</i>, divine; <i>eva ca</i>, and; the <i>asura</i>, the demoniacal which are being 
discussed. The Lord speaks of the need of restating the two that have been already referred to: <i>Daivah</i>, the divine creation of beings; <i>proktah</i>, has 
been spoken of; vistarasah, elaborately in, 'Fearlessness, purity of mind,' etc. (1-3). But the demoniacal has not been spoken of in extenso. Hence, O son of Prtha, 
<i>srnu</i>, hear of, understand; the <i>asuram</i>, demoniacal; me, from Me, from My speech which is being uttered in detail, so that this may be avoided. 
Upto the end of the chapter the demoniacal nature is being presented as the qualities of creatures; for, when this is directly perceived, it becomes possible to 
eschew it (continued in the next verse).
