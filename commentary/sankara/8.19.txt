<p>O son of Prtha, <i>bhutva</i>, after being born again
and again at the approach of day; <i>sah eva</i>, that
very—not any other; <i>bhutagramah</i>, multitude of
beings, consisting of the moving and the non-moving objects that existed in the earlier cycle of
creation; <i>praliyate</i>, disappears repeatedly; <i>avasah</i>,
in spite of itself, without any independence whatever;
<i>ratri-agame</i>, at the approach of night, at the close
of the day. <i>Prabhavati</i>, it comes to life, verily in
spite of itself; <i>ahar-agame</i>, at the approach of day.
The means for the attainment of that Immutable
which was introduced has been pointed out in, 'He
who departs by leaving the body while uttering the
single syllable, viz Om, which is Brahman, ' etc.
(13). Now, with a view to indicating the real nature
of that very Immutable, this is being said—that It is
to be reached through this path of yoga described in the
next verse.</p>
