<p><i>Viduh</i>, they know; that <i>ahah</i>, day; <i>brahmanah</i>,
of Brahma, of Prajapati, of Virat; <i>yat</i>, which;
<i>sahasra-yuga-paryantam</i>, ends in a thousand
yugas; and also the <i>ratirm</i>, night; <i>yuga-sahasraantam</i>,
which ends in a thousand yugas, having the
same duration as the day. Who knows (these)?</p>

<p>In reply the Lord says: <i>Te</i>, they; <i>janah</i>, people;
<i>ahoratra-vidah</i>, who are the knowers of what day
and night are, i.e. the people who know the
measurement of time. Since the worlds are thus
delimited by time, therefore they are subject to
return. What happens during the day and the night
of Prajapati is being stated in the next verse.</p>
