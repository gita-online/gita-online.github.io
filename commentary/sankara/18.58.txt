<i>Maccittah</i>, having your mind fixed on Me; <i>tarisyasi</i>, you will cross over; 
<i>sarva-durgani</i>, all difficulties, all causes of transmigration which are difficult 
to overcome; <i>mat-prasadat</i>, through My grace. <i>Atha cet</i>, if, on the other 
hand; <i>tvam</i>, you; <i>na srosyasi</i>, will not listen to, will not accept, 
My words; <i>ahankarat</i>, out of egoism, thinking 'I am learned'; then 
<i>vinanksyasi</i>, you will get destroyed, will court ruin. And this should not be 
thought of by you - 'I am independent. Why should I follow another's bidding?'
