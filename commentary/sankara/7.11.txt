<p>I am the <i>balam</i>, strength, ability, virility;
<i>balavatam</i>, of the strong. That strength, again, is
<i>kama-raga-vivarjitam</i>, devoid of passion and
attachment. <i>Kamah</i> is passion, hankering for things
not at hand. <i>Ragah</i> is attachment, fondness for
things acquired. I am the strength that is devoid of
them and is necessary merely for the maintenance
of the body etc., but not that strength of the
worldly which causes hankering and attachment.
Further, <i>bhutesu</i>, among creatures; I am that
<i>kamah</i>, desire-such desires as for eating, drinking,
etc. which are for the mere maintenance of the
body and so on; which is <i>dharma-aviruddhah</i>, not
contrary to righteousness, not opposed to
scriptural injunctions; <i>bharatarsabha</i>, O scion of
the Bharata dynasty.</p>
