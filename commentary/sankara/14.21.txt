    <i>Prabho</i>, O Lord; <i>kaih</i>, by what; <i>lingaih</i>, signs; <i>bhavati</i>, is one (known); <i>atitah</i>, who has gone beyond; <i>etan</i>, 
    these; <i>trin</i>, three; <i>gunan</i>, qualities that have been explained? <i>Kim</i>, what; is his <i>acarah</i>, behaviour; <i>ca</i>, and; 
    <i>katham</i>, how, in what way; <i>ativartate</i>, does he transcend; <i>etan</i>, these; <i>trin</i>, three; <i>gunan</i>, qualities?

    In this verse the signs of one who has gone beyond the qualities, and the means of transcending them have been asked by Arjuna. By way of 
    replying to the two questions, the Lord said: 'As for the question, 'With what sings does one who has gone beyond the qualities become 
    endowed with?", listen to them:' (in the next verse).
