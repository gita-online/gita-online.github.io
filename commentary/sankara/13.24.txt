    <i>Sah yah</i>, he who; <i>vetti</i>, knows, in the manner described; the <i>purusam</i>, Person, that Self possessed 
    of the characteristics stated above, as 'I myself (am That)'; and knows <i>prakrtim</i>, Nature as described above, 
    which is characterized as ignorance; to have been eradicated by Knowledge, <i>saha</i>, along with; <i>gunaih</i>, the 
    qualities which are its modifications; <i>na abhijayate</i>, will not be born; <i>bhuyah</i>, again-after the fall of 
    this body of the man of realization, he does not become born again for (taking) another body, i.e. he does not 
    take up another body; <i>sarvatha api</i>, in whatever way; <i>vartamanah</i>, he may live. From the word api it is 
    understood that, it goes without saying that one who is firm in his own duty is not reborn.

    <b>Objection</b>: Though it has been said that there is absence of rebirth after the dawn of Knowledge, still is not 
    illogical that actions done (in the present life) before the rise of Knowledge and those done subsequently, as also 
    those done in the many past lives, should be destroyed without yielding their results? Hence there should be three births! 
    For destruction of acquired merit is not logical, to the same extent as actions that have produced the present birth 
    and are yielding their proper results (cannot be destroyed). Besides, it is not understood that actions have 
    distinctions. Therefore, the actions of the three kinds, without exception, will produce three births or they all 
    collectively will produce one birth. Otherwise, if the acquired merits become destroyed, it will lead to loss of faith 
    everywhere as well as to the purposelessness of scriptures. Therefore it has been illogical to say, 'he will not be born 
    again.'

    <b>Reply</b>: No, for the burning away of all the actions of the man of knowledge has been stated in hundreds of Upanisadic 
    texts such as: 'And all one's actions become dissipated' (Mu.2.2.8); 'Anyone who knows (that supreme) Brahman, becomes 
    Brahman' (op. cit. 3.2.9); 'For him the delay is for so long only (as he does not become freed)' (Ch. 6.14.2); 'As 
    the fibres at the tip of a blade of reed (become completely burnt...,' so) all actions 'get completely burnt' 
    (Op. cit. 5.24.3). Here too the burning of all actions has been stated in, 'as a blazing fire reduces pieces of 
    wood to ashes,...'etc. (4.37), and He will also say so (later). This accords with reason also. Verily, actions, which 
    arise from the seed of evils like ignorance and desires, germinate the sprout of rebirth. Here also it has been said 
    by the Lord in various places that actions which are associated with egoism and desire for results bear fruits, 
    not the others. And there is also the verse: 'As seeds burnt by fire do not germinate, so also the Self does not 
    acquire another body due to evils that have been burnt by Knowledge (cf. Mbh. Va. 199. 107).
</p> 

<p>
    <b>Objection</b>: It may be granted for the present that actions performed after the rise of Knowledge are burnt by 
    Knowledge, since they coexist with Knowledge. But the burning away of actions done in this life prior to the rise 
    of Knowledge and those done in the many past lives is not reasonable.
</p> 

<p><b>Reply</b>: No, because of the qualification, 'all actions' (4.37).</p> 

<p><b>Objection</b>: May it not be that 'all actions' means those that are undertaken after Illumination?</p> 

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: No, for there is no reason for the restriction (of the meaning). On the other hand, as for the statement, 
    'just as actions that have produced the present birth and are already active in producing their results do not get 
    dissipated even after Illumination, similarly it is not reasonable that actions which have not commenced producing 
    their results should get dissipated,' - that is wrong. 
</p>

<p><b>Objection</b>: Why? </p>

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: Since they have already begun producing results, like an arrow that has been shot: As an arrow, freed 
    earlier from a bow for hitting a target, even after piercing through the target comes to a stop only after falling 
    down as a result of the dissipation of its initial momentum, similarly, actions that produced the (present) body 
    verily continue, even after fulfilling the purpose of maintaining the body, to exist as before until the dissipation 
    of their inherent tendencies. But, as that very arrow, when it has not acquired the momentum, needed for action, 
    when it has not been shot even though fixed on the bow, can be withdrawn, similarly, actions which have not begun 
    yielding their results may be rendered unproductive by Knowledge, even while existing in their receptacle. Hence, 
    it is established that , it has been reasonable to state that on the fall of the present body of an enlightened person, 
    'He is not born again.' Here are being presented these meditation etc. which are the alternative means for the 
    realization of the Self in the next verse.
