    <i>Te</i>, to you; <i>anasuyave</i>, who are not given to cavilling, who are free from 
    carping; <i>pravaksyami</i>, I shall speak of; <i>idam</i>, this. The Lord uttered 
    the word 'this' by bearing in mind as an immediately present fact the knowledge of 
    Brahman that will be and was spoken of in the earlier chapters. 
</p>

<p>
    The word tu (however) is used for pointing out a distinction. (I shall speak) of this 
    itself - What is that? (it is) <i>guhyatamam</i>, the highest secret; and is 
    <i>jnanam</i>, Knowledge, complete Knowledge - nothing else, the direct means to 
    Liberation, as stated in the Upanisads and the Smrtis, 'Vasudeva is all' (7.19), 
    'the Self verily is all this' (Ch. 7.25.2), 'One only, without a second' 
    (op. cit. 6.2.1), etc., and also as stated in such Upanisadic texts as, 'On the 
    other hand, those who understand otherwise than this come under a different ruler, 
    and belong to the worlds that are subject to decay' (op. cit. 7.25.2). (Knowledge) 
    of what kind? 
</p>

<p>
    It is <i>vijnana-sahitam</i>, combined with experience; <i>jnatva</i>, by realizing, 
    by attaining; <i>yat</i>, which Knowledge; moksyase, you shall be free; <i>asubhat</i>, 
    from evil, from worldly bondage.
