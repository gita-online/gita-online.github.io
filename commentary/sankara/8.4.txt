<p><i>Adhibhutam</i>, that which exists in the physical
plane, i.e. that which exists by comprising all
creatures; What is it? It consists of the <i>ksarah</i>
bhavah, mutable entity. <i>Ksarah</i> is that which is
mutable, which is destructible; <i>bhavah</i> means
anything whatsoever that has origination. This is
meaning. <i>Purusah</i> means the Person, derived in
the sense of he by whom all things are pervaded;
or, he who lies in every heart. He is
<i>Hiranyagarbha</i>, who resides in the Sun and
sustains the organs of all creatures. He is <i>adhidaivatam</i>,
the entity existing in the divine plane.
<i>Deha-bhrtam-vara</i>, O best among the embodied
beings; <i>adhiyajnah</i>, the entity existing in sacrifices,
is the Deity, called <i>Visnu</i>, presiding over all
sacrifices-which agrees with the Vedic text,
'Sacrifice is indeed Vishu' (Tai, Sam. 1.7.4). <i>Aham</i>
eva, I Myself, who am that very <i>Visnu</i>; am
<i>adhiyajnah</i>, the entity existing in the sacrifice;
which is going on <i>atra dehe</i>, in this body. Since a
sacrifice is performed with the body, therefore it is
closely associated with the body. In this sense it is
said to be going on in the body.</p>
