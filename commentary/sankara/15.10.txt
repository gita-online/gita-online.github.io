Thus, the embodied soul, <i>utkarmantam</i>, when it is leaving the body-the body that was assumed earlier; or <i>sthitam</i>, while residing in the 
(present) body; or <i>bhunjanam</i>, experiencing sound etc.; or <i>guna-anvitam</i>, in association with, i.e. identified with, the qualities 
called happiness, sorrow and delusion-even when, under such conditions, this one comes very much within the range of cognition; <i>vimudhah</i>, the 
persons who are diversely deluded as a result of their hearts being forcibly attracted by the enjoyments of seen and unseen objects; <i>na</i>, do not; 
<i>anu-pasyanti</i>, see. And the Lord regrets this saying, 'Alas! How sorrowful this is!' Those others, again, <i>jnana-caksusah</i>, who have the 
eye of knowledge, who have the insight of understanding which has arisen from the valid means of knowledge, i.e., those having a clear vision; 
<i>pasyanti</i>, see this one.
