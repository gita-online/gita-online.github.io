    A person's throat becomes choked with phlegm and his eyes full of tears when, on being struck 
    with fear, he is overcome by sorrow, and when, on being overwhelmed with affection, he is filled with joy. The 
    indistinctness and feebleness of sound in speech that follows as a result is what is called faltering (gadgada). 
    A speech that is accompanied with (saha) this is sa-gadgadam. It is used adverbially to the act of utterance.

    of Sanjaya have a purpose in view. How?

    It is thus: Thinking that the helpless Duryodhana will be as good as dead when the four unconquerable ones, 
    viz Drona and others, are killed, Dhrtarastra, losing hope of victory, would conclude a treaty. From that 
    will follow peace on either side. Under the influence of fate, Dhrtarastra did not even listen to that!
