    Arjuna, O Arjuna-one whose self is naturally white (pure), i.e. one possessing a pure 
    internal organ. This follows from the Vedic text, 'The day is dark and the day is 
    Arjuna (white) (Rg. 6.9.1). <i>Isvarah</i>, the Lord , Narayana the Ruler; 
    <i>tisthati</i>, resides, remains seated; <i>hrd-dese</i>, in the region of the heart; 
    <i>sarva-bhutanam</i>, of all creatures, of all living beings. How does He reside?

    In answer the Lord says: <i>bhramayan</i>, revolving; <i>mayaya</i>, through Maya, 
    through delusion; sarva-bhutani, all the creatures; as though yantra-arudhani, mounted 
    on a machine-like man' etc., made of wood, mounted on a machine. The word iva (as though) 
    has to be thus understood here. <i>Bhramayan</i>, revolving, is to be connected with 
    <i>tisthati</i>, resides (conveying the idea, 'resides...while revolving').
