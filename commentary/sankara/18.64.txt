<i>Srnu</i>, listen; <i>bhuyah</i>, again; to <i>me</i>, My; <i>paramam</i>, highest; 
<i>vacah</i>, utternace; which is <i>sarva-guhyatamam</i>, profundest of all, most 
secret of all secrets, though it has been repeatedly stated. Neither from fear nor even 
for the sake of money am I speaking! What then? <i>Iti</i>, since, considering that; 
<i>asi</i>, you are; <i>drdham</i>, ever, unwaveringly; <i>istah</i>, dear; <i>me</i>, 
to Me; <i>tatah</i>, therefore, for that reason; <i>vaksyami</i>, I shall speak; what is 
<i>hitam</i>, beneficial; <i>te</i>, to you, what is the highest means of attaining 
Knowledge. That is indeed the most beneficial of all beneficial things. 'What is that 
(You are going to tell me)?' In answer the Lord says the next verse.
