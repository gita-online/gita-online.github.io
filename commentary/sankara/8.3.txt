<p><i>Aksaram</i> means that which does not perish (na
ksarati), the supreme Self. This agrees with the
Upanisadic text, 'Under the mighty rule of this
Immutable, O Gargi...' (Br. 3.8.9).</p>

<p>And (the letter)
<i>Om</i> is not accept here, because of its being mentioned (as a
letter) later on in, 'The single letter <i>Om</i>, which is
Brahman' (13).</p>

<p>Besides, the adjective 'supreme' is
more apporpriate with regard to the absolute,
immutable Brahman. By <i>svabhava</i>, self-hood, is
meant the existence of that very supreme Brahman
in every body as the indwelling Self. <i>Svabhavah</i>
ucyate, self-hood is said to be, is referred to by the
word; <i>adhyatmam</i>, the entity which, as the
indwelling Self, exists in the body (atma) by
making it its habitat (adhikrtya), and which in the
ultimate analysis is the supreme Brahman.</p>

<p><i>Visargah</i>, the offerings, the giving away to gods of
things like porridge, cake, etc.; <i>bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah</i>,
which bring about the origin of the existence of
things; is karma-sanjnitah, meant by action.</p>

<p>This sacrifice consisting in pouring of oblations is called
action. The existence (bhava) of (moving and
nonmoving) things (bhuta) is bhuta-bhava. The
coming into being (udbhava) of that (existence) is
bhuta-bhava-udbhavah. That which causes (karoti)
this is bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, i.e. the
originator of existing things. It is needed from this
source that all beings, moving and non-moving,
originate through the successive processes of
rainfall etc. (see 3.14-15).</p>
