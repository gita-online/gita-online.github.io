<i>Sthanam</i>, the State called Liberation; <i>yat prapyate</i>, that is reached; <i>sankhyaih</i>, by the Sankhyas, 
by the monks steadfast in Knowledge; <i>tat prapyate</i>, that is reached; <i>yogaih</i>, by the yogis; <i>api</i>, 
as well. The yogis are those who, as a means to the attainment of Knowledge, undertake actions by dedicating them to 
God without seeking any result for themselves.<br><br>

The purport is that, by them also that Stated is reached through the process of acquiring monasticism which is a 
result of the knowledge of the supreme Reality. Therefore, <i>sah</i>, he; <i>pasyati</i>, sees truly; <i>yah</i>, who; 
<i>pasyati</i>, sees; Sankhya and yoga as <i>ekam</i>, one, because of the identity of their results.<br><br>

<b>Objection</b>: If this be so, then monasticism itself excels yoga! Why, then, is it said, 'Among the two, Karma-yoga, 
however, excels renunciation of actions'?<br><br>

<b>Vedantin</b>: Hear the reason for this: Having view the mere giving up of actions and Karma yoga, your question was 
as to which one was better of the two. My answer was accordingly given that Karma-yoga excels renunciation of actions 
(resorted to) without Knowledge is Sankhya. This is what was meant by me. And that is indeed yoga in the highest sense. 
However, that which is the Vedic Karma-yoga is figuratively spoken of as yoga and renunciation since it leads to it 
(supreme Knowledge). How does it lead to that? The answer is in the next verse.
