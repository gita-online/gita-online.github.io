<i>Jnatva</i>, knowing; <i>yat</i>, which - by acquiring which Knowledge imparted by them; O Pandava, <i>na vasyasi</i>, you 
will not come under; <i>moham</i>, delusion; <i>punah</i>, again; <i>evam</i>, in this way, in the way you have come under 
delusion now. Besides, yena, through which Knowledge; <i>draksyasi</i>, you will see directly; <i>bhutani</i>, all beings; 
asesena, without exception, counting from Brahma down to a clump of grass; <i>atmani</i>, in the Self, in the innermost Self, 
thus-'These beings exist in me'; and <i>atha</i>, also; see that these are <i>mayi</i>, in Me, in Vasudeva, the supreme Lord.<br><br>

The purport is, 'You will realize the identity of the individual Self and God, which is well known in the Upanisads.' 
Moreover, the greatness of this Knowledge is given in the next verse.
