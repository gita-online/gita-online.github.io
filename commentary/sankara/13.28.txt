<p>
    <i>Sah</i>, he; <i>pasyati</i>, sees; <i>yah</i>, who; <i>pasyati</i>, sees; Whom? <i>Parameswaram</i>, the supreme Lord 
    the Lord who is supreme as compared with the body, organs, mind, intellect, the Unmanifest and the individual soul; 
    as <i>tisthantam</i>, existing, having His presence; <i>samam</i>, equally, without distinction; Where? <i>sarvesu</i>, 
    in all; <i>bhutesu</i>, beings, all living things from Brahma to the non-moving; He who sees Him existing equally in 
    all living things.
</p> 

<p>
    The Lord specifies them by the word <i>vinasyatsu</i>, among the perishable; and He also specifies Him, the supreme Lord, 
    by the word <i>avinasyantam</i>, the Imperishable. This is meant for showing the absolute difference between the 
    living things and God. How? For, all the modifications of an existing thing have as their root that modification of an 
    existing thing described as birth. All other modifications of existing things that follow birth end with destruction. 
    After destruction there is no modification of an existing thing, because the object itself becomes nonexistent.
</p> 

<p>
    Indeed, qualities can exist so long as the thing qualified exists. Therefore, by the reiteration of the absence of 
    the last modification of an existing thing, all its preceding modifications become negated along with their effects. 
    Hence it is established that the supreme Lord is very greatly different from all beings, and is also Unconditioned and One. 
    He sees who thus sees the supreme Lord as described.

<p><b>Objection</b>: Is it not that all poeple see? What is the need of specification?</p> 

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: True, they see; but they see contrarily! Hence the Lord specifies, 'He alone sees'. As in comparison 
    ith one who, suffering from the (eye) disease called Timira, sees many moons, the person who sees one moon is distingusihed 
    by saying, 'He alone sees,' similarly, here as well, the man who sees the one undivided Self as described above is 
    distinguished from those who contrarily see many and differentiated selves, by saying 'He alone sees'. Others, 
    though seeing, do not see because they see contrarily like the person who sees many moons.
</p> 

<p>
    This is the meaning. The obove-described true knowledge has to be praised by stating its result. Hence the next verse
    begins.
