<i>Rajarsayah</i>, the king-sages, those who were kings and sages (at the same time); <i>viduh</i>, knew; <i>imam</i>, this 
Yoga; which was <i>evam parampara praptam</i>, received thus through a regular succession of Ksatriyas. <i>Sah</i>, that; 
<i>yogah</i>, Yoga; <i>nastah</i>, is lost, has go its traditional line snapped; <i>iha</i>, now; <i>mahata kalena</i>, 
owing to a long lapse of time; <i>parantapa</i>, O destroyer of foes. By para are meant those against oneself. He who, 
like the sun, 'scorches' (tapayati) them by the 'rays' of the 'heat' of his prowess is parantapa, i.e. scorcher of 
antagonists. Noticing that the Yoga has got lost by reaching people who are weak and have no control of their organs, and 
that the world has become associated with goals that do not lead to Liberation.
