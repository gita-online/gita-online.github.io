<i>Iha eva</i>, here itself, even while they are living; is <i>sargah</i>, rebirth; <i>jitah</i>, conquered, overcome; 
<i>taih</i>, by them, by the learned ones who see with equanimity; <i>yesam</i>, whose; <i>manah</i>, minds, the internal 
organs; are <i>sthitam</i>, established, made steadfast; <i>samye</i>, on sameness, in Brahman that exists as the same 
in all beings.<br><br>

It is nirdosam, free from defects. Because of Its existence in such mean objects as an eater of dog's meat, etc., though 
It is supposed by fools to be affected by the defects of those (objects), still It remains untouched by those blemishes, 
<i>hi</i>, because It is free from defects. Nor even is It differentiated by Its qualities, since Consciousness is free 
from qualifications. And the Lord will speak of desires etc. (cf. 13.6 etc.) as the attributes of the aggregate of body 
and organs, and will also say, 'Being without beginning and without qualities' (13.31). Nor even are there the ultimate 
distinctions which can create differentiation in the Self, because there is nothing to prove that these ultimate 
distinctions exist in every body.<br><br>

<b>Note</b>:<em>According to the Vaisesikas, everything is possessed of 
not only qualities but also of antya-visesa (ultimate distinction), which is a category like substance, quality, action, etc.
This distinction makes every entity different from other entities. Thus, individual souls have their own ultimate 
distinctions by the very fact that they are individuals. Vedanta denies such a category. Besides, the Self is one and 
omnipresent. Therefore there is nothing else from which It can be distinguished.</em><br><br>

Hence, <i>samam brahma</i>, Brahman is the same and one. <i>Tasmat</i>, therefore; <i>te</i>, they; <i>sthitah</i>, 
are established; <i>brahmani</i>, in Brahman Itself. As a result, not even a shade of defect touches them. For they 
have no self-identification in the form of perceiving the aggregate of body etc. as the Self. On the other hand, 
that statement (Gau. Sm. 17.20) refers to the man who has self-identification in the form of perceiving the aggregate 
of body, (organs) etc. as the Self, for that statement - 'A sacrificer incurs sin by not adoring equally one who is 
an equal, and by adoring equally one who is not equal to himself, pointedly refers to persons who are the objects of 
adoration. It is indeed seen that in worship, charity, etc. the determining factors are the possession of such special 
qualities as being 'a knower of Brahman', 'versed in the six auxiliary branches of Vedic learning', and 'versed in 
the four Vedas'. But Brahman is bereft of association with all qualities and defects. This being so, it is logical 
that they are established in Brahman. And 'adoring an equal, ...an unequal,' etc. has reference to men of action.<br><br>

But this subject under consideration, beginning from 'The embodied man...having given up all actions mentally' (13) 
to the end of the chapter, is concerning one who has given up all actions.
