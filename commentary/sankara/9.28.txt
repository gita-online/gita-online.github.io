    By dedicating to Me <i>evam</i>, thus; <i>maksyase</i>, you will become free; 
    <i>karma-bandhanaih</i>, from bondage in the form of actions - actions themselves 
    being the bonds; <i>subha-asubha-phalaih</i>, which are productive of good and bad 
    results i.e. from actions that have desirable (subha) and undesireable (asubha) 
    results (phala).

<p>
    <i>Sannyasa</i>, renunciation, is that which results from dedication (of actions) 
    to Me, and that is also yoga since it involves actions. He who has his mind (atma) 
    endowed (yukta) with that yoga of renunciation (sannyasa-yoga) is 
    <i>sannyasa-yoga-yukta-atma</i>. You, being such, having your mind endowed with 
    the yoga of renunciation, and <i>vimuktah</i>, becoming free from the bonds of 
    actions evern while living; <i>upaisyasi</i>, will attain, come; <i>mam</i>, to Me, 
    when this body falls.

    In that case the Lord is possessed of love and hatred in as much as He favours the 
    devotees, and not others? That is exlpained in the next verse.
