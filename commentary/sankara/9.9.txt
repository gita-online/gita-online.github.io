    O Dhananjaya, <i>na ca</i>, nor do; <i>tani</i>, those; <i>karmani</i>, actions - 
    which are the sources of the creation of the multitude of beings unequally; 
    <i>nibadhnanti</i>, bind; <i>mam</i>, Me, who am God. 
</p>

<p>
    As to that, the Lord states the reason for His not becoming associated with the actions: 
    <i>Asinam</i>, remaining (as I do); <i>udasinavat</i>, like one unconcerned, like some 
    indifferent spectator - for the Self is not subject to any change; and <i>asaktam</i>, 
    unattached; <i>tesu karmasu</i>, to those actions - free from attachment to results, 
    free from the egoism that 'I do.'
</p> 

<p>
    Hence, even in the case of any other person also, the absence of the idea of 
    agentship and the absence of attachment to results are the causes of not getting 
    bound. Otherwise, like the silkworm, a foolish man becomes bound by acitons. 
    This is the idea. There (in th previous two verses) it involves a contradiction to say, 
    'Remaining like one unconcerned, I project forth this multitude of beings.' 
    In order to dispel this doubt the Lord says the next verse.
