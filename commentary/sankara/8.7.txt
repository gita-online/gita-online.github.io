<p><i>Tasmat</i>, therefore; <i>anusmara</i>, think of; <i>mam</i>,
Me, in the way prescribed by the scriptures;
<i>sarvesu kalesu</i>, at all times; and <i>yudhya</i>, fight,
engage yourself in war, which is your own
duty. <i>Asamsayah</i>, there is no doubt in this matter;
that <i>arpita-mano-buddhih</i>, by dedicating your
mind and intellect; <i>mayi;</i> to Me; <i>esyasi,</i> you—you
who have thus dedicated your mind and intellect to
Me, Vasudeva—will attain; <i>mam eva,</i> Me alone, as I
shall be remembered.</p>

<p>When the Lord instructs Arjuna to think of Him, 
and at the same time engage in war, it may seem that 
He envisages a combination of Knowledge and action. 
But this is not so because when one thinks of 
all actions, accessories, and results that come 
within the purview of the mind and the intellect as Brahman,
it is denied that actions, etc. have any separate
reality apart from Brahman. Therefore no
combination is involved here.</p>
