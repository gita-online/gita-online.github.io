    <i>Yah</i>, he who; <i>abhi-dhasyati</i>, will speak of, i.e., will present with the help 
    of the text and its meaning, as I have done to you; <i>imam</i>, this; <i>paramam</i>, 
    highest-that which has Liberation as its purpose; <i>guhyam</i>, secret, as spoken of above i.e. 
    the text in the form of a conversation between Kesava and Arjuna; <i>madbhaktesu</i>, to My 
    devotees.

<p>
    How will he present? This is being stated: <i>Krtva</i>, entertaining; <i>param</i>, supreme; 
    <i>bhaktim</i>, devotion; <i>mayi</i>, to Me, i.e., entertaining an idea thus-'A service is 
    being rendered by me to the Lord who is the supreme Teacher'.

<p>
    To him comes this result: <i>esyati</i>, he will reach; <i>mam</i>, Me; eva, alone. He is 
    certainly freed. No doubt should be entertained in this regard. By the repetition of (the word) 
    bhakti (devotion), it is understood that one becomes fit for being taught (this) Scripture by 
    virtue of devotion alone to Him.
