Death which is of two kinds - one destroying wealth, and the other destroying life, is called <i>sarva-harah</i>, 
the destroyer of all. I am that. This is the meaning. Or, the supreme God is the all - destroyer because He 
destroys everything during dissolution. I am He. And I am <i>udbhavah</i>, prosperity, eminence, and the means 
to it. Of whom? <i>Bhavisyatam</i>, of those destined to be prosperous, i.e. of those who are fit for attaining 
eminence. <i>Narinam</i>, of the feminine qualities; I am <i>kirtih</i>, fame; <i>srih</i>, beauty; <i>vak</i>, 
speech; <i>smrtih</i>, memory; <i>medha</i>, intelligence <i>dhrtih</i>, fortitude; and <i>ksama</i>, forbearance. 
I am these excellent feminine quialities, by coming to possess even a trace of which one considers himself 
successful.
