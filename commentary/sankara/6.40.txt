<p><i>O Partha</i>, there is certainly; <i>eva vidyate</i>, no doubt;
<i>na vinasah</i>, no ruin; <i>tasya</i>, for him; <i>iha</i>, here, in this
world; or <i>amutra</i>, hereafter, in the other world.
Ruin means a birth inferior to the previous one;
that is not there for one who has fallen from Yoga.
<i>Hi</i>, indeed; <i>na kascit</i>, no one; <i>kalyana-krt</i>, engaged in
good; <i>gacchati</i>, meets with; <i>durgatim</i>, a deplorable
end; <i>tata</i>, My son! A father is called tata because he
perpetuates himself (tanoti) through the son. Since
the father himself becomes the son, therefore the
son also is called tata. A disciple is called putra
(son). But what happens to him?</p>
