    <i>Pravaksyami</i>, I shall speak of, fully describe just as it is; <i>tat</i>, that; <i>yat</i>, which; 
    is <i>jenyam</i>, to be known. In order to interest the hearer through inducement, the Lord speaks of 
    what its result is: <i>Jnatva</i>, by realizing; <i>yat</i>, which Knowable; <i>asnute</i>, one attains; 
    <i>amrtam</i>, Immortality, i.e.; he does not die again. <i>Anadimat</i>, without beginning - one having 
    a beginning (adi) is adimat; one not having a beginning is anadimat. What is that? 
</p>

<p>
    The <i>param</i>, supreme, unsurpassable; <i>brahma</i>, Brahman, which is under discussion as the Knowable. 
    Here, some split up the phrase anadimatparam as anadi and matparam because, if the word anadimat is taken 
    as a Bahuvrihi compound, then the suffix mat (matup) becomes redundant, which is undesirable. And they 
    show a distintive meaning: (Brahman is anadi, beginningless, and is) matparam, that of which I am the 
    supreme (para) power called Vasudeva. Truly, the redundance could be avoided in this way if that meanig 
    were possible. 
</p>

<p>
    But that meaning is not possible, because what is intended is to make Brahman known only through a negation 
    of all attributes by saying, 'It is called neither being nor non-being.' It is contradictory to show a 
    possession of a distinctive power and to negate attributes. Therefore, although matup and a bahuvrihi 
    compound convey the same meaning of 'possession', its (matup's) use is for completing the verse. Having 
    aroused an interest through inducement by saying, 'The Knowable which has Immortality as its result is 
    being spoken of by Me,' the Lord says: 
</p>

<p>
    <i>Tat</i>, that Knowable; <i>ucyate</i>, is called; <i>na sat</i>, neither being; nor is it called <i>asat</i>, 
    non-being. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Objection</b>: After strongly girding up the loins and declaring with a loud voice, 'I shall speak of 
    the Knowable,' is it not incongruous to say, 'That is called neither being nor non-being'? 
</p>

<p><b>Reply</b>: No. What has been said is surely consistent. </p>

<p><b>Objection</b>: How? </p>

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: For in all the Upanisads, the Knowable, i.e. Brahman, has been indicated only by negation 
    of all attributes - 'Not this, not this' (Br. 4.4.22), 'Not gross, not subtle' (op. cit. 3.3.8), etc.; 
    but not as 'That is this', for It is beyond speech.
</p> 

<p>
    <b>Objection</b>: Is it not that a thing which cannot be expressed by the word 'being' does not exist? 
    Like-wise, if the Knowable cannot be expressed by the word 'being', It does not exist. And it is 
    contradictory to say, 'It is the Knowable', and 'It cannot be expressed by the word "being".'
</p> 

<p>
    <b>Counter-Objection</b>: As to that, no that It does not exist, because It is not the object of the idea, 
    'It is non-being.' 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Objection</b>: Do not all cognitions verily involve the idea of being or non being? This being so, the 
    Knowable should either be an object of a cognition involving the idea of existence, or it should be an 
    object of a cognition involving the idea of non-existence. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: No, because, by virtue of Its being super-sensuous, It is not an object of cognition 
    involving either, of the two ideas. Indeed, any object perceivable by the senses, such as pot etc., 
    can be either an object of cognition involving the idea of existence, or it can be an object of 
    cognition involving the idea of non existence. But this Knowable, being supersensuous and known from 
    the scriptures, which are the sole means of (Its) knowledge, is not, like pot etc., an object of 
    cognition involving either of the two ideas. Therefore It is called neither being nor non being. 
    As for your objection that it is contradictory to say, 'It is the Knowable, but it is neither called 
    being nor non-being,' - it is not contradictory; for the Upanisad says, 'That (Brahman) is surely 
    different from the known and, again, It is above the unknown' (Ke. 1.4). 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Objection</b>: May it not be that even the Upanisad is contradictory in its meaning? May it not be 
    (contradictory) as it is when, after beginning with the topic of a shed for a sacrifice, it is said, 
    'Who indeed knows whether there exists anything in the other world or not!' (Tai. Sam.6.1.1) 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: No, since the Upanisad speaking of something that is different from the known and the 
    unknown is meant for establishing an entity that must be realized. But, '...whether there exists anything 
    in the other world,' etc. is merely an arthavada connected with an injunction. From reason who it follows 
    that Brahman cannot be expressed by such words as being, non-being, etc. For, every word used for 
    expressing an object, when heard by listeners, makes them understand its meaning through the comprehension 
    of its significance with the help of genus, action, quality and relation; not in any other way, because 
    that is not a matter of experience. 
</p>

<p>
    To illustrate this: a cow, or a horse, etc. (is comprehended) through genus; cooking or reading, through 
    action; white or black, through quality; a rich person or an owner of cows, through relation. But Brahman 
    does not belong to any genus. Hence it is not expressible by words like 'being' etc.; neither is It 
    possessed of any qualitity with the help of which It could be expressed through qualifying words, 
    for It is free from qualities; nor can It be expressed by a word implying action, It being free from 
    actions-which accords with the Upanisadic text, 'Partless, actionless, calm' (Sv. 6.19). Nor has It any 
    elation, since It is one, non-dual, not an object of the senses, and It is the Self. Therefore it is 
    logical that It cannot be expressed by any word. And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as, 
    'From which, words trun back' (Tai. 2.4.1), etc. 
</p>

<p>
    Therefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word. And this follows from such Upanisadic 
    texts as, 'From which, words turn back' (Tai. 2.4.1), etc. Since the Knowable (Brahman) is not an object 
    of the word or thought of 'being', there arises the apprehension of Its nonexistence. Hence, for dispelling 
    that apprehension by establishing Its existence with the help of the adjuncts in the form of the organs 
    of all creatures, the Lord says the next verse.
