    <i>Viddhi</i>, know; <i>tat</i>, that; <i>jnanam</i>, knowledge, realization of the Self as non-dual, complete 
    realization; to be <i>sattvikam</i>, originating from sattva; <i>yena</i>, through which knowledge; <i>iksate</i>, 
    one sees; <i>ekam</i>, a single; <i>avyayam</i>, undecaying-that which does not undergo mutation either in itself 
    or by the mutation of its qualities' i.e. eternal and immutable; <i>bhavam</i>, Entity-the word bhava is used 
    to imply an entity-, i.e. the single Reality which is the Self; sarvabhutesu, in all things, in all things 
    begining from the Unmanifest to the unmoving things; and through which knowledge one sees that Entity to be 
    avibhaktam, undivided; in every body, <i>vibhaktesu</i>, in all the deversified things, in the different bodies.

    The idea is: that Reality which is the Self remains, like Space, undivided. Being based on rajas and tamas, 
    those that are the dualistic philosophies are incomplete, and hence are not by themselves adequate for the 
    eradication of worldly existence.
