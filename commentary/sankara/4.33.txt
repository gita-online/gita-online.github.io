O destroyer of enemies, <i>jnana-yajnah</i>, Knowledge considered as a sacrifice; is <i>sreyan</i>, greater; 
<i>dravyamayat yajnat</i>, than sacrifices requiring materials. For, a sacrifice performed with materials is an 
originator of results, but Knowledge considered as a sacrifice is not productive of results. It only reveals 
the state of Liberation that is an achieved fact. (According to Advaitism, Liberation consists in the removal of 
ignorance by Illumination. Nothing new is produced thereby). Hence it is greater, more praiseworthy.<br><br>

How?<br><br>

Because, <i>sarvam</i>, all; <i>karma-akhilam</i>, actions in their totality, without exception; O son of Prtha, 
<i>parisamapyate</i>, culminate, get merged (attain their consummation); <i>jnane</i>, in Knowledge, which is a 
means to Liberation and is comparable to 'a flood all around' (cf. 2.46). This is the idea, which accords with the 
Upanisadic text, 'As when the (face of a die) bearing the number 4, called Krta, wins, the other inferior 
(numbers on the die-faces) get included in it, so whatever good actions are performed by beings, all that gets 
merged in this one (Raikva). So it happens to anyone who knows what he (Raikva) knew' (Ch. 4.1.4). In that case, 
by what means is this highly estimable Knowledge acquired? The answer is being given in the next verse.
