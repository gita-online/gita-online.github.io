    <i>Anukampartham</i>, out of compassion; <i>tesam eva</i>, for them alone, anxious 
    as to how they may have bliss; <i>aham</i>, I; <i>atmabhavasthah</i>, residing in 
    their hearts - atmabhavah means the seat that is the heart; being seated there itself; 
    <i>nasayami</i>, destroy; <i>tamah</i>, the darkness; <i>ajnanajam</i>, born of ignorance, 
    originating from non-discrimination, the darkness of delusion known as false comprehension; 
    <i>jnana dipena</i>, with the lamp of Knowledge, in the form of discriminating comprehension; 
    i.e. bhasvata, with the luminous lamp of Knowledge - fed by the oil of divine grace resulting 
    from devotion, fanned by the wind of intensity of meditation on Me, having the wick of the 
    intellect imbued with the impressions arising from such disciplines as celibacy etc., in the 
    receptacle of the detached mind, placed in the windless shelter of the mind withdrawn from 
    objects and untainted by likes and dislikes, and made luminous by full Illumination resulting 
    from the practice of constant concentration and meditation.
