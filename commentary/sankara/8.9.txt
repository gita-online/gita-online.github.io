<p><i>Yah</i>, he who, anyone who; <i>anusmaret</i>,
meditates on; <i>kavim</i>, the Omniscient, the Knower
of things past, present, and future; <i>puranam</i>, the
Ancient, the Eternal; <i>anusasitaram</i>, the Ruler, the
Lord of the whole Universe; <i>aniyamsam</i>, subtler;
<i>anoh</i>, than the subtle; <i>dhataram</i>, the Ordainer;
<i>sarvasya</i>, of everything — one who grants the fruits
of actions, in all their varieties, individually to all
creatures; <i>acintya-rupam</i>, who is of inconceivable
form—His form, though always existing, defies
being conceived of by anybody; <i>aditya-varnam</i>,
who is effulgent like the sun, who is manifest as
eternal Consciousness like the effulgence of the
sun; and <i>parastat</i>, beyond; <i>tamasah</i>, darkness—
beyond the darkness of delusion in the form of
ignorance—(he attains the supreme Person). This
verse is to be connected with the earlier itself thus:
'by meditating (on Him)...he attains Him.'</p>
