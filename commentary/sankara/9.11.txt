<i>Ajanatah</i>, not knowing; <i>mama</i>, My; <i>param</i>, supreme; <i>bhavam</i>, 
nature - My supreme Reality, which is like space, nay, which is subtler and more 
pervasive than space; as <i>bhuta-maheswaram</i>, the Lord of all beings, the great 
Lord of all beings who is their Self; <i>mudhah</i>, foolish people, the non 
discriminating ones; <i>avajananti</i>, disregard, belittle; <i>mam</i>, Me, 
although I am by nature thus eternal, pure, intelligent, free and the Self of all 
beings; and <i>asritam</i>, who have taken; manusim tanum, a human body common to men, 
i.e. when I act with the help of a human body. 

As a result of that, as a result of continously disrespecting Me, those wretches 
get ruined. How? That is explained in the next verse.
