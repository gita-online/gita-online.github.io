<p><i>Pravaksye</i>, I shall speak; <i>te</i>, to you;
<i>samgrahena</i>, briefly; <i>tat</i>, of that; which is called the
<i>aksaram</i>, immutable—that which does not get
exhausted, which is indestructible; <i>padam</i>, Goal to
be reached; <i>yat</i>, which; <i>veda-vidah</i>, the knowers of
the Vedas, the knowers of the purport of the
Vedas; <i>vedanti</i>, declare, speak of It as opposed to
all qualifications - 'It is neither gross nor minute' (Br.
3.8.8) etc., in accordance with the Upanisadic text,
'O Gargi, the knowers of Brahman say this
Immutable (Brahman) is that' (ibid); and further,
<i>yat</i>, into which, after the attainment of complete
realization; <i>visanti</i>, enter; <i>yatayah</i>, the diligent
ones, the monks; who have become <i>vita-ragah</i>, free
from attachment; and <i>icchantah</i>, aspiring to know
(to know being supplied to complete the sense);

<p>Commencing with, '"O venerable sir, which world
does he really win thereby who, among men,
intently meditates on Om in that wonerful way till
death?" To him he said, "O Satyakama, this very
Brahman that is (known as) the inferior and
superior is but this Om"' (pr.5.1-2), it has been
stated, 'Again, anyone who meditates on the
supreme Purusa with the help of this very syllable
Om, as possessed of three letters,...he is lifted up to
the world of Brahma (Hiranyagarbha) by the
Sama-mantras,' (op.cit.5) etc. Again, beginning
with 'Tell me of that thing which you see as
different from virtue, different from vice,' it has
been stated, 'I tell you briefly of that goal which all
the Vedas with one voice propound, which all the
austerities speak of, and wishing for which people
practise Brahmacarya: it is this, viz Om' (Ka.1.2.14-
15), etc.</p>

<p>In the above quotations, Om which is
going to be spoken of is presented as a name of this
supreme Brahman, and also as Its symbol like an
image. This has been done as a means to
meditation on it (Om) for the attainment of the
supreme Brahman by people of low and mediocre
intellect, in as much as this leads to Liberation in
course of time. Here also that very meditation on
Om in the manner stated above—which is the means
of attaining the supreme Brahman introduced in,
'(He who meditates on) the Omniscient, the
Ancient,' and in, '(I shall speak to you briefly of
that immutable Goal) which the knowers of the
Vedas declare,' and which (meditation) leads to
Liberation in due course has to be spoken of along with 
'adherence to yoga' as also whatever is connected directly 
or indirectly with it. For this purpose the next verse
begins.</p>
