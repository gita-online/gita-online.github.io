<p><i>Partha</i>, O son of Prtha; <i>anu-cintayan</i>, by
meditating, i.e. contemplating in accordance with
(<i>anu</i>) the instruction of teachers and scriptures;
<i>cestasa</i>, with a mind; <i>abhyasa-yogayuktena</i>,
engaged in the yoga of practiceâ€”<i>abhyasa</i>, practice,
consists in the repetition of the same kind of
thought, uninterrupted by any contrary idea, with
regard to Me who am the object of concentration of
the mind; that practice itself is yoga; the mind of a
yogi is engrossed (<i>yuktam</i>) in that itself; with a
mind that is such, and <i>na anya-gamina</i>, which does
not stray away to anything else, which is not
inclined to go away to any other object; <i>yati</i>, one
reaches; the <i>paramam</i>, supreme, unsurpassed;
<i>purusam</i>, Person; <i>divyam</i>, existing in the effulgent
region (<i>divi</i>), in the Solar Orb. And, to what kind of
a Person does he go? This is being stated in the next
verse.</p>
