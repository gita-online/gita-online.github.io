<i>Pandava</i>, O son of Pandu; <i>yah</i>, he who; <i>mat karma-krt</i>, works for Me: work for Me is 
mat karma; one who does it is mat-karma-krt. <i>Mat paramah</i>, who accepts Me as the supreme Goal: 
A servant does work for his master, but does not accept the master as his own supreme Goal to be attained 
after death; his one, however, who does work for Me, accepts Me alone as the supreme Goal. Thus he is 
matparamah - one to whom I am the supreme Goal. So also he who is <i>madbhaktah</i>, devoted to me: He adores 
Me alone in all ways, with his whole being and full enthusiasm. Thus he is madbhaktah. <i>Sanga-varjitah</i>, 
who is devoid of attachment for wealth, sons, friends, wife and relatives, <i>Sanga</i> means fondness, love; 
devoid of them. <i>Nirvairah</i>, who is free from enmity; <i>sarva bhutesu</i>, towards all beings - berefit 
of the idea of enmity even towards those engaged in doing unmost harm to him. <i>Sah</i>, he who is such a 
devotee of Mine; <i>eti</i>, attains; <i>mam</i>, Me. I alone am his supreme Goal; he does not attain any 
other goal. This is the advice for you, given by Me as desired by you.
