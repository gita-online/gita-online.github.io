<i>Te</i>, they, the domoniacal persons; <i>ahuh</i>, say; that the <i>jagat</i>, world; is <i>asatyam</i>, unreal-as we ourselves are prone to falsehood, so 
is this whole world unreal; <i>apratistham</i>, it has no basis, it does not have righteousness and unrighteousness as its basis; it is <i>anisvaram</i>, without 
a God-nor is there a God who rules this (world) according to rigtheousness and unrighteousness (of beings). Hence they say that the world is godless. 
Moreover, it is <i>aparaspara-sambhutam</i>, born of mutual union. The whole world is born of the union of the male and female impelled by passion. (That union is) 
<i>kama-haitukam</i>, brought about by passion. Kama-haitukam and kama-hetukam are the same. <i>Kim anyat</i>, what other (cause can there be)? There exists to 
other unseen cause such as righteousness, unrigtheousness, etc. Certainly, the passion of living beings is the cause of the world. This is the view of the materialists.
