<p><i>Iccha-dvesa-samutthena</i>, by what arises from
likes and dislikes: <i>iccha</i>, likes, and <i>dvesa</i>, dislikes,
are <i>iccha-dvesau</i>; anything arising from them is
<i>icchadvesa-samutthah</i>. (Creatures are duluded) by
that.</p>

<p>By what? When that is thus sought to be
known in particular, the Lord answers: <i>dvandvamohena</i>,
by the delusion of duality. Delusion
(<i>moha</i>) that originates from duality (<i>advandva</i>) is
<i>dvandva-moha</i>.</p>

<p>Those very likes and dislikes,
which are mutually opposed like heat and cold,
which relate to happiness and sorrow and their
causes, and which come into association with all
beings in due course, are termed as duality (and
this deludes all creatures). As regards them, when
likes and dislikes arise from the experience of
happiness, sorrow and their causes, then, by
bringing the wisdom of all beings under their
control, they create bewilderment which is the
cause of the impediment to the rise of knowledge
about the reality of Self, the supreme Truth. Indeed,
exact knowledge about objects even in the external
world does not arise in one whose mind is
overpowered by the defects, viz. likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that knowledge of the
indwelling Self, beset with many obstacles as it is,
does not arise in a completely bewildered person
whose intelligence has been overcome by them.</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>bharata</i>, O scion of the Bharata dynasty;
owing to that delusion of duality arising from likes
and dislikes, <i>sarvabhutani</i>, all creatures become
deluded. <i>Parantapa</i>, O destroyer of foes; they <i>yanti
sammoham</i>, become bewildered, come under
delusion; <i>sarge</i>, at the time of their birth, i.e. at the
time of their origination.</p>

<p>The idea is that all creatures that come into being do so 
prepossessed by delusion. 'Since this is so, therefore all 
creatures, being deluded and having their wisdom
obstructed by that delusion of duality, do not
know Me who am their Self. Hence, they do not
adore Me as their Self.' 'Who, again, are those that,
becoming free from the delusion of duality, come
to know You, and adore You as the Self in
accordance with the scriptures?' In order to
elaborate the subject enquired about, the Lord
says the next verse.</p>
