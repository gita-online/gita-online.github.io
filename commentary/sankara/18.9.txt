    <i>Yat</i>, whatever; <i>niyatam karma</i>, daily obligatory duty; <i>kriyate</i>, is performed, 
    accomplished; <i>iti eva</i>, just because; it is <i>karyam</i>, a bounden duty; O Arjuna, 
    <i>tyaktva</i>, by giving up; <i>sangam</i>, attachment; and <i>phalam</i>, the result; <i>ca eva</i>, 
    as well; <i>sah</i>, that; <i>tyagah</i>, renunciation, giving up of attachment and (hankering for) 
    the resutls of daily obligatory duties; <i>matah</i>, is considered; to be <i>sattvikah</i>, based 
    on sattva, arising from <i>sattva</i>. 
</p>

<p>
    We said that the Lord's utterance is proof of the fruitfulness 
    of daily obligatory duties. Or, even if the niyakarmas be understood (from the Lord's worlds) to be 
    fruitless, still the ignorant man does certainly imagine that the nityakarmas (daily obligatory duites) 
    when performed produce for oneself a result either in the form of purification of the mind or avoidance 
    of evil. As to this, the Lord aborts even that imagination by saying, 'by giving up the result'. 
    Hence it has been well said, 'by giving up attachment and the result'.

    <b>Objection</b>: Well, is not the threefold relinquishment of actions, also called sannyasa, 
    under discussion? As regards this, the renunciation based on tamas and rajas have been stated. 
    Why is the relinquishment of attachment and (desire for their) results spoken of here as the third? 
    This is like somebody saying, 'Three Priests have come. Of them two are versed in the six auxiliaries 
    (The six auxiliaries are: Siksa (Phonetics), Kalpa (Code of Rituals and Sacrifices), Vyakarana (Grammar), 
    Nirukta (Etymology), Chandas (Meter, Prosody), and Jyotisa (Astronomy)) of the Vedas; the third is a 
    Soldier!'

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: This is not wrong, for this is meant as a eulogy on the basis of the common factor of 
    renunciation. Between renunciation of actions and renunciation. of hankering for results, there is, 
    indeed, the similarity of the fact of renunciation. While on this subject, by condemning 'renunciation 
    of actions' on account of its being based on rajas and tamas, the 'renunciation of desire for results 
    of actions' is being praised on account of its being based on sattva, by saying, 'that renunciation 
    is considered to be based on sattva.' The internal organ of a person who is qualified for rites and duties, 
    who performs the nityakarmas by giving up attachment and hankering for results, becomes pure on 
    account of its being untainted by attachment to results etc. and refined by the nitya-karmas. When it 
    is pure and tranquil, it becomes capable of contemplating on the Self.
</p> 

<p>
    Since, for that very person whose internal organ has become purified by performing the nityakarmas 
    and who has become ready for the knowledge of the Self, the process by which he can become 
    steadfast in it has to be stated, therefore the Lord says the next verse.
