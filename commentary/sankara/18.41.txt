    <i>Parantapa</i>, O scorcher of enemies; <i>karmani</i>, the duties; <i>brahmana-ksatriya-visam</i>, of the 
    Priests, the Warriors and the Merchants; <i>ca</i>, as also; <i>sudranam</i>, of the Workers-the Workers have 
    not been included with the others (in the compund word) because, owing to their having a single birth, i.e, 
    they are traditionally not subject to Vedic renunciation ('dwija' means 'Twice Born', that happens when one 
    undergoes training of Vedic scriptures since childhood and at the end is given a sacred thread to wear as 
    part of the initiation, as is considered reborn after that initiation) and learning of the Vedas (they may 
    however, seek Liberation through the reading of two epics, the Puranas, etc.); <i>pravibhaktani</i>, have 
    been fully classified, have been prescribed by making distinctions among them; According to what? <i>gunahi</i>, 
    according to the gunas; <i>svabhava prabhavaih</i>, born from Nature. 
</p>

<p>
    Nature means the Praktrti of God, His Maya consisting of the three gunas. 'Born from Nature' means 
    'born of these three gunas. In accordnace with these the duties such as control of the internal organs, etc. 
    of the Brahmanas and others have been classified. Or (the meaning is): The source of the nature of the 
    Brahmanas is the quality of sattva. Similarly, the source of the nature of the Ksatriyas is rajas, with 
    sattva as a subordinate (quality); the source of the nature of the Vaisyas is rajas, with tamas as the 
    subordinate (quality); the source of the nature of the Sudras is tamas, with rajas as the subordinate (quality); 
    for the natures of the four are seen to be Tranquillity, Lordliness, Industriousness and Dullness respectively. 
    Or, svabhava (nature) means the (individual) tendencies of creatures earned in their past lives, which have 
    become manifest in the present life for yielding their own results. 
</p>

<p>
    The gunas which have that svabhava as their source (prabhava) are svabhava-prabhavah gunah. Since the 
    manifestation of the gunas cannot logically be uncaused, therefore a specific cause has been posited by 
    saying that Nature is the cause. Thus, the duties such as control of the internal organs etc. have been 
    classified in keeping with the effects of the gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas, which are born of Nature, 
    born of Prakrti. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Objection</b>: Well, are not the duties like controlling the internal organs etc. of the Brahmanas and 
    others classified and enjoined by the scriptures? Why is it said that they are classified according to 
    the gunas sattva etc.? 
    
</p>

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: This objection is not valid. For, the duties like controlling the internal organs etc. of 
    the Brahmanas and others have been classified even by the scriptures verily in keeping with the specific 
    qualities sattva etc.; certainly, not without reference to the gunas. Hence, though the duties have been 
    divided by the scriputres, they are said to have been classified according to the gunas. Which, again, 
    are those duties? They are being spoken of in the next verse.
