<p><i>Abuddhayah</i>, the unintelligent, the non-discriminating
ones; <i>ajanantah</i>, unaware; <i>mama</i>, of
My; <i>param</i>, supreme; <i>bhavam</i>, state, My reality as
the supreme Self; which is <i>avyayam</i>, immutable,
undecaying; and <i>anuttanam</i>, unsurpassable,
<i>manyante</i>, think; <i>mam</i>, of Me; as <i>avyaktam</i>, the
unmanifest, the invisible; <i>apannam</i>, that has
become; <i>vyaktim</i>, manifest, visible, at present
though I am the ever well-known God. They think
so because they are unaware of My reality. This is
the idea. What is the reason for their ignorance?
This is being stated in the next verse.</p>
