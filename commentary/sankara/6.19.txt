<p><i>Yatha</i>, as; a <i>dipah</i>, lamp; <i>nivata-sthah</i>, kept in
a windless place; <i>na ingate</i>, does not flicker; <i>sa upama</i>,
such is the simile - that with which
something is compared is an <i>upama</i> (smile);
<i>smrta</i>, thought of, by the knowers of Yoga who
understand the movements of the mind; <i>yoginah</i>,
for the yogi; <i>yata-citasya</i>, whose mind is under
control; and <i>yunjatah</i>, who is engaged in; <i>yogam</i>,
concentration; <i>atmanah</i>, on the Self, i.e. who is
practising Self-absorption. By dint of practising
Yoga thus, when the mind, comparable to a lamp
in a windless place, becomes concentrated.</p>
