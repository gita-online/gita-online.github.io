    <i>Sattvikah</i>, those having the sattva quality, those steadfast in sattva; <i>yajante</i>, worship; <i>devan</i>, the gods; <i>rajasah</i>, those having rajas; 
    (worship) <i>yaksa-raksamsi</i>, the demi-gods and ogres; and <i>anye</i>, other; <i>janah</i>, people; <i>tamasah</i>, possessed of tamas; <i>yajante</i>, worship; 
    <i>pretan</i>, ghosts; and <i>bhuta ganan</i>, the hosts of spirits - Sapta-matrkas (the Seven Mothers) and others. Thus, in the context of abandonment of 
    scriptural injunctions, the states of sattva etc. have been determined through their effects.

    As regards that, it is only one in thousands who, being established in sattva, becomes devoted to the adoration of gods. But, to be sure, creatures are mostly 
    rooted deeply in rajas or tamas. How? That is explainedi in the next verse.
