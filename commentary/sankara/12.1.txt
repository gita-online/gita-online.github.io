<p>
    The subject-matter stated in the immediately preceding verse, '...he who works for Me,' etc. is referred 
    to by the word evam (thus). <i>Ye bhaktah</i>, those devotees who, seeking no other refuge; <i>evam</i>, 
    thus; <i>satata-yuktah</i>, being ever-devoted, i.e., remaining unceasingly engaged in the works of the 
    Lord, etc., intent on the aforesaid purpose; <i>paryupasate</i>, meditate; <i>tvam</i>, on You, in the 
    Cosmic form as revealed earlier; <i>ye ca api</i>, and those others, again, who have renounced all desires, 
    who have given up all actions; who meditate on Brahman as described (below), <i>aksaram</i>, on the 
    Immutable; <i>avyaktam</i>, on the Unmanifested, which is so on account of being bereft of all limiting 
    adjuncts, (and) which is beyond the comprehension of the organs - in the world, whatever comes within the 
    range of the organs is said to be manifest, for the root anj conveys that sense; but this Immutable is 
    the opposite of that and is endowed with qualifications that are spoken of by the great ones; those again, 
    who meditate on that; <i>tesam</i>, of them, among the two (groups); <i>ke</i>, who; are the <i>yoga-vit-tamah</i>, 
    best experiencers of yoga, i.e., who are those that are surpassingly versed in yoga? 
</p>

<p>
    But leave alone those who meditate on the Immutable, who are fully enlightened and are free from desires. 
    Whatever has to be said with regard to them, we shall say later on. As for those others... (continue to the
    next verse)
