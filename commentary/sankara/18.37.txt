<i>Yat</i>, that joy which is; <i>iva</i>, like; <i>visam</i>, poison, a source of pain; <i>agre</i>, in the 
beginning-when it first comes in the early stages of (acquisition) of knowledge, detachment, meditation and 
absorption, since they involve great struggle; but <i>amrtopamam</i>, comparable to nectar; <i>pariname</i>, 
in the end, when it arises from the maturity of knowledge, detachment, etc.; and which <i>atma buddhi-prasadajam</i>, 
arises from the purity (prasada), trasparence like water, of one's intellect (atma-buddhi); <i>tat</i>, that; 
<i>sukham</i>, joy; is <i>proktam</i>, spoken of, by the learned ones; as <i>sattvikam</i>, born of sattva. Or, 
the phrase atma-buddhi-prasadajam may mean 'arising from the high degree of clearness of that atma-buddhi 
(knowledge of or connected with the Self)'; therefore it is born of sattva.
