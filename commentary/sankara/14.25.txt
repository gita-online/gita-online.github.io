Further, <i>tulyah</i>, he who is the same, unperturbed; <i>mana-apamanayoh</i>, under honour and dishonour; <i>tulyah</i>, who is equally disposed; 
<i>mitra-ari-paksayoh</i>, both towards the side of the friend and of the foe-although from their own standpoint some may be unattached, still, 
in others' view they may appear to be siding either with friends or foes; hence it is said, 'equally disposed both towards the side of the 
friend and of the foe'; <i>sarva-arambha-parityagi</i>, who has renounced all enterprise (those which are undertaken are arambhah, actions intended 
for seen or unseen results), i.e. who is apt to give up all undertakings, who has given up all actions other than those needed merely for the 
maintenance of the body; sah, he; <i>ucyate</i>, is said to have; <i>gunatitah</i>, gone beyond the qualities. The disciplines leading 
to the state of transcendence of the qualities, which have been stated (in the verses) beginning from 'he who, sitting like one indifferent,' 
and ending with 'he is said to have gone beyond the qualities,' have to be practised by a monk, a seeker of Liberation, so long as they are to be 
achieved through effort. But when they become firmly ingrained, they become the indications, perceivable to himself, of a monk who has transcended 
the qualities. Now the Lord gives the reply to the question, 'And how does he transcend the qualties?'.
