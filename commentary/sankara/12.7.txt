O son of Prtha, <i>tesam</i>, for them who are solely devoted to meditating on Me; <i>avesita-cetasam mayi</i>, who 
have their minds absorbed in, fixed on, merged in, Me who am the Cosmic Person; <i>aham</i>, I, God; <i>bhavami</i>, 
become; <i>na cirat</i>, without delay; What then? soon indeed - the samuddharta, Deliverer. Where from? In answer 
the Lord says, <i>mrtyu-samsara-sagarat</i>, from the sea of the world which is fraught with death. Samsara (world) 
fraught with mrtyu (death) is <i>mrtyu-samsara</i>. That itself is like a sea, being difficult to cross. I become 
their deliverer from that sea of transmigration which is fraught with death.
