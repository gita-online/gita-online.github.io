    He who is the <i>upadrasta</i>, Witness, who while staying nearby does not Himself become involved: As when the priests 
    and the performer of a sacrifice remain engaged in duties connected with the sacrifice, there is another (called Brahma) 
    remaining nearby who is unengaged, is versed in the science of sacrifices and witnesses the merit or demerit of the 
    activities of the priest and the performer of the sacrifice, similarly, He who is not engaged in the activities of and 
    is different from the body and organs, who has characteristics other than theirs, and is the proximate (upa) observer 
    (drasta) of the body and organs engaged in their duties, is the upa-drasta. Or: The observers are the body, eyes, mind, 
    intellect and the soul. Of them the body is the external observer. Proceeding inwards from that (body), the Self is the 
    inmost as also the proximate observer, compared with which there is no other higher and inner observer. The Self, 
    because of being the most proximate observer, is the upadrasta. Or, It is the upadrasta since, like the non-looker 
    of a sarifice, It witness everything.

<p>
    And He is the <i>anu-manta</i>, <b>Permitter</b>; <i>Anumananam</i>, approval, means satisfaction with those performers 
    (viz body and organs) as also their perfomances. The agent of that (approval) is the anumanta. Or, He is the anumanta 
    since, even though Himself not engaged in the activities of the body and organs, He appears to be favourably disposed 
    towards and engaged in them. Or, He is the anumanta because, when the body and organs are engaged in their own functions, 
    He remains as a witness and never dissuades them.

<p>
    It is the bharta, <b>Sustainer</b>: Bharanam means the continuance in their own state of the body, organs, mind and 
    intellect, which reflect consciousness and have become aggregated owing to the need of serving the purpose of some 
    other entity, viz the conscious Self. And that (continuance) is verily due to the consciousness that is the Self. 
    In this sense the Self is said to be the Sustainer.
</p> 

<p>
    It is the bhokta, <b>Experiencer</b>: As heat is by fire, similarly, the experiences of the intellect-in the form of 
    happiness, sorrow and delusion in relation to all objects, when born as though permeated by the consciousness that is 
    the Self, are manifested differently by the Self which is of the nature of eternal Consciousness. In this sense the 
    Self is said to be the Experiencer. 
</p>

<p>
    He is <i>maheswarah</i>, the great God, because, as the Self of all and independent, He is the great Ruler. 
</p>

<p>
    He is <i>paramatma</i>, the transcendental Self, because He is the Self which has the characteristics of being the 
    supreme Witness etc. of (all) those-beginning from the body and ending with the intellect, which are imagined through 
    gnorance to be the indwelling Self. 
</p>

<p>
    He is <i>api ca</i>, also; <i>uktah</i>, spoken of, referred to, in the Upanisads; <i>iti</i>, as, with the words; 
    'He is the indwelling One, the paramatma, the transcendental Self'. Where is He? The <i>parah</i>, suprem; <i>purusah</i>, 
    Person, who is higher than the Unmanifest and who will be spoken of in, 'But different is the supreme Person who is 
    spoken of as the transcendental Self' (15.17); is asmin, in this; dehe, body. What has been presented in, '...also 
    understand Me to be the Knower of the field' (2), has been explained and concluded.
