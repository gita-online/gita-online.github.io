<p><i>Ye bhavah</i>, those things; <i>sattvikah eva</i>, that
indeed are made of (the quality of) sattva; and <i>ye 
rajasah</i>, those that are made (of the quality) of
rajas; and <i>tamasah</i>, those that are made of (the 
quality of) tamas-whatever things are made (of 
sattva, rajas and tamas) according to the creatures's 
own actions: <i>viddhi</i>, know; <i>tan</i>, them, all without 
exception; <i>mattah eva iti</i>, to have sprung from Me 
alone when they come into being. Although they 
originate from Me, still, <i>tu</i>, however; <i>aham</i>, I; am 
<i>na tesu</i>, not in them - I am not subject to them, not 
under their control, as are the transmigrating 
beings. <i>Te</i>, they, again; <i>mayi</i>, are in Me, subject to 
Me, under My control.</p> 

<p>'The world does not know Me, the supreme
Lord, even though I am of this kind, and am
eternal, pure, intelligent and free by nature, 
the Self of all beings, free from all
qualities, the cause of burning away the seed of the
evil of transmigration!'- in this way the Lord
expresses regret. And what is the source of that
ignorance in the world? That is answered in the next
verse.</p>
