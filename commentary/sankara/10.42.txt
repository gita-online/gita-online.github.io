    <i>Athava</i>, or, on the other hand; <i>kim</i>, what is the need; of <i>tava jnatena</i>, your knowing; 
    <i>etena bahuna</i>, this extensively- but incompletely - in the above manner, O Arjuna? You listen to this 
    subject that is going to be stated in its fullness: <i>Aham</i>, I; <i>sthitah</i>, remain; <i>vistabhya</i>, 
    sustaining, supporting, holding firmly, in a special way; <i>idam</i>, this; <i>krtsnam</i>, whole; <i>jagat</i>, 
    creation; <i>ekamsena</i>, by a part, by a foot (of Myself), i.e. as the Self of all things.

    The Universe is called a foot of His by virtue of His having the limiting adjunct of being its 
    efficient and material cause. The Vedic text, 'All beings form a foot of His' (Rg., Pu. Su. 10.90.3; 
    Tai. Ar. 3.12.3) support this. A Form constituted by the whole of creation has been presented in 
    this chapter for meditation. Thereby the unqualified transcendental Reality, implied by the word 
    tat (in tattva-masi) and referred to by the latter portion of the Commentator's quotation 
    (viz tripadasyamrtam divi: The immortal three-footed One is established in His own effulgence), 
    ecomes established.
