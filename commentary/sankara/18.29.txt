    O Dhananjaya, <i>srnu</i>, listen; <i>bhedam</i>, to the classification; <i>buddheh</i>, of the intellect; 
    <i>ca eva</i>, as also; the classification <i>dhrteh</i>, of fortitude; <i>trividham</i>, which is threefold; 
    <i>gunatah</i>, according to the gunas, sattva etc. -this much is an apporistic statement; <i>procyamanam</i>, .
    while it is being stated; <i>asesena</i>, elaborately, just as it is, without omitting anything; and 
    <i>prthaktvena</i>, severally.

    Arjuna is called Dhananjaya because, in the course of his expedition to conquer all the quarters, he won 
    immense human and divine wealth (dhana).
