<i>Yah saknoti</i>, one who can, is able to; <i>sodhum</i>, withstand; <i>iha eva</i>, here itself, while alive; <i>prak</i>, 
before; <i>sarira-vimoksanat</i>, departing from the body, till death. Death is put as a limit because the impulse of desire 
and anger is certanily inevitable for a living person. For this impulse has got infinite sources. One should not relax until 
his death. That is the idea. Kama, desire, is the hankering, thirst, with regard to a coveted object - of an earlier experience, 
and which is a source of pleasure - when it comes within the range of the senses, or is heard of or remembered. And krodha, 
anger, is that repulsion one has against what are adverse to oneself and are sources of sorrow, when they are seen, heard 
of or remembered.<br><br>

That impulse (veda) which has those desire and anger as its source (udbhava) is kama-krodha-udbhava-vegah. The impulse arising 
from desire is a kind of mental agitation, and has the signs of horripilation, joyful eyes, face, etc. The impulse of anger 
has the signs of trembling of body, perspiration, bitting of lips, red eyes, etc. He who is able to withstand that impulse 
arising from desire and anger, sah narah, that man; is yuktah, a yogi; and sukhi, is happy, in this world. What kind of a 
person, being established in Brahman, attains Brahman? The Lord explains in the next verse.
