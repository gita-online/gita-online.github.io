<p>
    <i>Kaunteya</i>, O son of Kunti; <i>sarva-bhutani</i>, all the beings - all the beings 
    which, like wind abiding in space, abide thus in Me during their period of existence; 
    <i>yanti</i>, go back; <i>kalpa-ksaye</i>, at the end of a cycle, at the time of 
    dissolution; <i>mamikam prakrtim</i>, to My Prakrti which consists of the three 
    gunas (qualities; see 7.13) and is (called My) lower Nature. 
</p>

<p>
    <i>Punah</i>, again; <i>aham</i>, I; <i>visrjami</i>, project forth, create; 
    <i>tani</i>, them, the beings, as before; <i>kalpadau</i>, at the beginning of a 
    cycle, at the time of creation.
