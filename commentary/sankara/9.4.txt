    <i>Idam</i>, this; <i>sarvam</i>, whole; <i>jagat</i>, world; is <i>tatam</i>, 
    pervaded; <i>maya</i>, by Me; through the supreme nature, that I have, 
    <i>avyakta-murtina</i>, in My unmanifest form, in that form in which My nature 
    is not manifest, i.e. in My form which is beyond the range of the organs. 
    <i>Sarva-bhutani</i>, all beings, from Brahma to a clump of grass; <i>matsthani</i>, 
    exist in Me, are established in Me in that unmanifest form.

<p>
    For, no created thing that is bereft of the Self (i.e. of Reality) can be conceived of 
    as an object of practical use. Therefore, being possessed of their reality through 
    Me who am their Self, they exist in Me. Hence they are said to be established in Me. 
    I Myself am the Self of those created things. Consequently, it appears to people of 
    little understanding that I dwell in them.

<p>
    Hence I say: <i>Na ca aham</i>, but I am not; <i>avasthitah</i>, contained; 
    <i>tesu</i>, in them, in the created things. Since unlike gross objects I am 
    not in contact with anything, therefore I am certainly the inmost core even 
    of space. For, a thing that has no contact with anything cannot exist like 
    something contained in a receptacle. For this very reason that I am not in 
    contact with anyting.
