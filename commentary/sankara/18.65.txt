    <i>Bhava manmana</i>, have your mind fixed on Me; be <i>mad-bhaktah</i>, My devotee; be a 
    <i>madyaji</i>, sacrificer to Me, be engaged in sacrifices to Me; <i>namaskuru</i>, 
    bow down; <i>mam</i>, to Me. Offer ever your salutations to Me alone. Continuing thus 
    in them, by surrendering all ends, means and needs to Vasudeva only, <i>esyasi</i>, you 
    will come; <i>mam</i>, to Me; eva, alone. (This) <i>satyam</i>, truth: do I 
    <i>pratijane</i>, promise; <i>te</i>, to you, i.e. in this matter I make this true 
    promise. For, <i>asi</i>, you are; <i>priyah</i>, dear; <i>me</i>, to Me.

    The idea conveyed by the passage is: Having thus understood that the Lord is true in 
    His pormise, and knowing for certain that liberation is the unfailing result of devotion 
    to the Lord, one should have dedication to God as his only supreme goal. Having summed 
    up surrender to God as the highest secret of steadiness in Karma yoga, thereafter, with 
    the idea that complete realization, which is the fruit of adherence to Karma-yoga and 
    which has been enjoined in all the Upanisads, has to be spoken about, the Lord says the
    next verse.
