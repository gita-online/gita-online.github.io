 <i>Tasya</i> signifies "of him," <i>yena</i> translates to "by whom," and <i>jitah</i> means "has been conquered" or "subdued." <i>Eva atma</i> represents the "very self," which encompasses the aggregate of body and organs. This <i>atma</i>, or self, is referred to as <i>bandhuh</i>, indicating it as the friend of the individual. The underlying concept is that one must be a conqueror of their senses. However, <i>tu</i>, which means "but," highlights that for someone who hasn't achieved self-control, their own <i>atma</i> acts as an enemy, <i>satruvat</i>, displaying hostility akin to that of an external adversary. Much like an enemy who inflicts harm from a distinct entity, one's own self can behave antagonistically towards themself. This interpretation underscores the significance of self-control and mastery over one's senses, as a lack thereof can obstruct concentration on the Self, making the body and organs counter-productive rather than supportive in this pursuit.
