    As the Self of the deities (of the sacrifices), <i>aham</i>, I; <i>hi</i>, indeed; 
    am the <i>bhokta</i>, enjoyer; <i>ca eva</i>, as also; the <i>prabhuh</i>, Lord; 
    <i>sarva-yajnanam</i>, of all sacrifices enjoined by the Vedas and the Smrtis. 
    A sacrifice is verily presided over by Me, for it has been said earlier, 
    'I Myself am the entity (called Visnu) that exists in the sacrifice in this body' 
    (8.4).

<p>
    <i>Tu</i>, but; <i>na abhi-jananti</i>, they do not know; <i>mam</i>, Me as such; 
    <i>tattvena</i>, in reality. And <i>atah</i>, therefore, by worshipping ignorantly; 
    <i>te</i>, they; <i>cyavanti</i>, fall from the result of the sacrifice. The result 
    of a sacrifice is inevitable even for those who worship ignorantly out of 
    their devotion to other deities. How? That is explained in the next verse.
