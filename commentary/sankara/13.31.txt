    <i>Yada</i>, when, at the time when; <i>anupasyati</i>, one realizes-having reflected in accordance with the instructions of the 
    scriptures and the teachers, one realizes as a matter of one's own direct experience that 'All this is but the Self' (Ch. 7.25.2); 
    that <i>bhuta-prthak-bhavam</i>, the state of diversity of living things; is <i>ekastham</i>, rooted in the One, existing in the one Self; 
    and their <i>vistaram</i>, manifestation, origination; <i>tatah</i>, eva, is also from That-when he realizes that origination in such 
    diverse ways as, 'the vital force is from the Self, hope is from the Self, memory is from the Self, space is from the Self, fire is 
    from the Self, water is from the Self, coming into being and withdrawal are owing to the Self, food is from the Self' (op. cit. 7.26.1); 
    <i>tada</i>, then, at that time; <i>brahma sampadyate</i>, one becomes identified with Brahman Itself.
