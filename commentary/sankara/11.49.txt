<i>Ma te vyatha</i>, may you have no fear; and <i>ma vimudha-bhavah</i>, may not there be bewilderment 
of the mind; <i>drstva</i>, by seeing, perceiving; <i>idam</i>, this <i>rupam</i>, form; <i>mama</i>, 
of Mine; <i>idrk ghoram</i>, so terrible, as was revealed. <i>Vyapetabhih</i>, becoming free from fear; 
and becoming <i>prita-manah</i>, gladdened in mind; <i>punah</i>, again; <i>prapasya</i>, see; <i>idam</i>, 
this; <i>eva</i>, very; <i>tat</i>, earlier; <i>rupam</i>, form; me, of Mine, with four hands, holding a 
conch, a discus and a mace, which is dear to you.
