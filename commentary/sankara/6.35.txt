undoubtedly - there is no doubt with regard to this;
that the <i>manah</i>, mind; is <i>durnigraham</i>, untractable;
and calm, restless. <i>Tu</i>, but; the modifications of
the mind in the form of distractions; <i>grhyate</i>, is
brought under control; <i>abhyasena</i>, through
practice - <i>abhyasa</i> means repetition of some idea or
thought of the mind on some mental plane; and 
<i>vairagyena</i>, through detachment - <i>vairagya</i> means absence of 
hankering for enjoyment of desirable things, seen or unseen,
as a result of the practice of discerning their defect.
That mind is thus brought under control, restrained,
i.e. completely subdued.</p>
