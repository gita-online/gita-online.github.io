<i>Balah</i>, the fools; <i>na panditah</i>, not the learned ones; <i>pravadanti</i>, speak of; <i>sankhya-yogau</i>, 
Sankhya (the Path of Knowledge) and (Karma-)yoga; as <i>prthak</i>, different, having opposite and different results. 
The learned ones, the wise, however, admit one, unconflicting result.<br><br>

How?<br><br>

Any one who <i>samyak</i>, properly; <i>asthitah</i>, resorts to, i.e. follows; <i>ekam api</i>, even one, between the 
Path of Knowledge and (Karma-) yoga; <i>vindate</i>, gets; <i>phalam</i>, the result; ubhayoh, of both. For, the result 
of both is that Liberation itself. Therefore there is no conflict with regard to the result.<br><br>

<b>Objection</b>: After beginning the topic with the words, 'renunciation' and '(Karma-) yoga', how is it that the Lord 
speaks of the identity of the results of the path of Knowledge and (Karma-) yoga, which is beside the point?<br><br>

<b>Vedantin</b>: This defect does not arise. Although the question was put by Arjuna merely with regard to renunciation 
and Karma-yoga, yet the Lord,without actually avoiding them, and by adding something special which was intended by Him, 
gave the answer by expressing them through other words, 'Sankhya' and '(Karma-) yoga'. Those very 'renunciation and 
'Karma-yoga', when they are (respectively) associated with Knowledge and such of Its means as equanimity etc., are 
meant by the words 'Sankhya' and 'yoga'. This is the Lord's veiw. Therefore there is no discussion out of the context. 
How can the result of both be attained by the proper performance of only one? The answer is in the next verse.
