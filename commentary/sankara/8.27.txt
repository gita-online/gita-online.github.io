<p><i>O son of Prtha</i>, na kascana yogi, no yogi
whosoever; <i>janan</i>, has known; <i>ete srti</i>, these two
courses as described - that one leads to worldly life,
and the other to Liberation; <i>muhyati</i>, becomes
deluded. <i>Tasmat</i>, therefore; O Arjuna, <i>bhava</i>, be
you; <i>yoga-yuktah</i>, steadfast in Yoga; <i>sarvesu
kalesu</i>, at all times.</p>
