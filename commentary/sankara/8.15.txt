<p><i>Upetya mam</i>, as a result of reaching Me who
am God—as a result of realizing My nature;
<i>mahatmanah</i>, the exalted ones, the monks; <i>gatah</i>,
who have attained; the <i>paramam</i>, highest;
<i>samsiddhim</i>, perfection, called Liberation; <i>na</i>, do
not; <i>apnuvanti</i>, get; this kind of <i>punarjanama</i>,
rebirth.</p>

<p>As to what kind of rebirth they do not get,
the Lord states its characteristics—<i>duhkhalayam</i>,
which is an abode of sorrows, a resort of physical
and other sorrows, i.e. a birth to which sorrows
adhere. It is not merely an abode of sorrows, but
also <i>asavatam</i>, impermanent, having no fixity of
nature. On the other hand, those who do not reach
Me, they come again. Again, 'Is it that those who
attain someone other than You return?' This is
being answered in the next verse.</p>
