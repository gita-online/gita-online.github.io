<i>Pasyami</i>, I see; <i>tvam</i>, You; as <i>kiritinam</i>, wearing a diadem - kirita is a kind of decoration 
for the head; one having it is <i>kiriti</i>; gadinam, wielding a mace; and also <i>cakrinam</i>, holding a disc; 
<i>tejorasim</i>, a mass of brilliance; <i>sarvatah diptimantam</i>, glowing all around; <i>durniriksyam</i>, 
difficult to look at; <i>samantat</i>, from all sides, at every point; as though <i>dipta-analarka-dyutim</i>, 
possessed of the radiance (dyuti) of the blazing (dipta) fire (anala) and sun (arka); and <i>aprameyam</i>, 
immeasurable, i.e. beyond limitation. 'For this reason also, i.e., by seeing Your power of Yoga, I infer' 
that (continued in the next verse).
