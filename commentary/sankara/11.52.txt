<i>Idam</i>, this; <i>rupam</i>, form; <i>mama</i>, of Mine; <i>yat</i>, which; <i>drstavan, asi</i>, 
you have seen is; <i>sudur darsam</i>, very difficult to see. <i>Api</i>, even; the <i>devah</i>, gods; 
are <i>nityam</i>, ever; <i>darsana-kanksinah</i>, desirous of a vision; <i>asya</i>, of this; <i>rupasya</i>, 
form of Mine. The idea is that though they want to see, they have not seen in the way you have, nor will they see! 
Why so? This is answered in the next verse.
