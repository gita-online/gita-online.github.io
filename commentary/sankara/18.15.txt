    <i>Yat</i>, whatever; <i>karma</i>, action; <i>narah</i>, a man; <i>prarabhate</i>, performs; with these 
    three-<i>sarira-van manobhih</i>, with the body, speech and mind; be it <i>nyayyam</i>, just, rigtheous, 
    conforming to the scriptures; <i>va</i>, or; <i>viparitam</i>, its reverse, not conforming to the 
    scriptures, unrighteous; and even such activities like closing the eyes etc. whch are consequent on the 
    fact of living (i.e. instinctive acts)-they also are certainly the result of righteous and unrighteous .
    acts done in earlier lives, and hence they are understood by the very, use of the words 'just and its 
    reverse'; tasya, of it, of all activities without exception; <i>ete</i>, these; <i>panca</i>, five, as 
    mentioned; are the <i>hetavah</i>, causes.

    <b>Objection</b>: Well, are not the locus etc. the cause of all actions? Why is it said, '...performs with 
    the body, speech and mind'? 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: This fault does not arise. All actions described as 'enjoined' or 'prohibited' are mainly 
    based on the three, body etc. Seeing, hearing, etc., which are characteristics of life and are subsidiaries 
    to these (body etc.) [Seeing etc. are accomplished by the eye etc., which are part and parcel of the 
    body etc.] , are divided into three groups and spoken of in, 'performs with the body,' etc. Even at the 
    time of reaping the fruits (of actions), they are experienced mainly through these (three). Hence, 
    there is no contradiction with the assertion that the five are the causes.
