    <i>Tesam</i>, to them, who, becoming devotees, adore Me in the manner described earlier; 
    <i>satata yuktanam</i>, who are ever devoted, ever attached, who have become free from

    Is it because of hankering for possessions? The Lord says: No, (they worship) 
    <i>priti-purvakam</i>, with love. To them who worship Me with that (love), <i>dadami</i>, 
    I grant; <i>tam</i>, that; <i>buddhi-yogam</i>, possession of wisdom buddhi means full 
    enlightenment with regard to My real nature; coming in possession (yoga) of that is 
    buddhi-yoga; <i>yena</i>, by which possession of wisdom consisting in full enlightenment; 
    <i>upayanti</i>, they reach, realize as their own Self; <i>mam</i>, Me, the supreme God 
    who is the Self.

<p>
    Who do so? <i>Te</i>, they, who adore Me through such disciplines as fixing their minds on Me, 
    etc. 'For what purpose, or as the destroyer of what cause standing as an obstacle on the way 
    of reaching You, do You bestow that possession of wisdom to those devotees of Yours?' In reply 
    to such a query the Lord says the next verse.
