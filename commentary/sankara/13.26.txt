    <i>Anye tu</i>, others again; <i>ajanantah</i>, who do not know the Self as described above; <i>evam</i>, thus, even in 
    one of these alternative ways; <i>upasate</i>, take to thinking, take to reflection, being imbued with faith; <i>srutva</i>, 
    after hearing; <i>anyebhyah</i>, from others, from the teachers, having been told, 'Think only of this.' <i>Te api ca</i>, 
    they, too; <i>sruti-parayanah</i>, who are devoted to hearing, to whom hearing is the supreme course, the best discipline 
    for starting on the path to Liberation, i.e., those who, themselves lacking in discrimination, accept only others' advice 
    as most authoritative; <i>eva</i>, certainly; <i>ati-taranti</i>, overcome; <i>mrtyum</i>, death, i.e. the mundane 
    existence which is fraught with death.

    The implication is: It goes without saying that those discriminating people who are idenpendent in the application of 
    the valid means of knowledge, cross over death. That the knowledge of the identity of the Knower of the field and 
    God leads to Liberation has been stated in, '...by realizing which one attains Immortality' (12). For what reason is 
    it so? To point out that reason the (next) verse is begun.
