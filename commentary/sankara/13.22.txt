    <i>Hi</i>, since; <i>purusah</i>, the soul, the experiencer; is <i>prakrtisthah</i>, seated in Nature, which is characterized 
    as ignorance and gets transformed into body and organs, i.e., (since the soul) has become identified with Nature; therefore, 
    <i>bhunkte</i>, it enjoys, i.e. experiences; <i>gunan</i>, the qualities manifest as happiness, sorrow and delusion; 
    <i>prakrtijan</i>, born of Nature, thinking thus, 'I am happy, sorrowful, deluded, learned.' Even though ignorance 
    continues as a cause, still the main cause of worldly existence, of birth, is the contact, the self-identification, 
    ith the qualities happiness, sorrow, and delusion-when they are experienced, as is affirmed by the Upanisadic text, 
    'What it desires, it resolves' (Br. 4.4.5).

<p>
    That very fact is stated here: <i>Gunasangah</i>, contact with the qualities; is <i>karanam</i>, the cause; <i>asya</i>, 
    of its, the soul's, the experiencer's; <i>sad-asad-yoni-janmasu</i>, births in good and evil wombs. Self-identification 
    with the qualities is the cause of the experience of births in good and evil wombs. Or the meaning is, 'Self-identification 
    with the qualities is the cause or its worldly existence through birth in good and evil wombs,' where the words 'of 
    worldly existence' have to be supplied. The good wombs are he wombs of gods and others; evil wombs are the wombs of gods 
    and others; evil wombs are the wombs of beasts etc. From the force of the context it is to be understood that there is 
    no contradiction in including even human wombs among 'good and evil wombs'. It amounts to saying that ignorance called 
    'being seated in Nature'-and the contact with. i.e. the desire for, the qualities are the causes of worldly existence.

<p>
    And this is said so that they can be avoided. And in the scripture Gita it is a well-known fact that knowledge and 
    dispassion, accompanied with renunciation, are the causes of removing this (ignorance and self-identification with the 
    qualities). That knowledge about the field and the Knower of the field, too, has been presented earlier. This has also 
    been said in, '...by realizing which one attains Immortality' (12), etc., through the process of refutation of elements 
    alien (to the Self) and superimposition of qualities belonging to others (that are not the Self). A direct presentation 
    is again being made of that (knowledge) itself in the next verse.
