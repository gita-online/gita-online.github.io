<p><i>Ante</i>, at the end, after the completion;
<i>bahunam</i>, of many; <i>janmanam</i>, births, which
become the repository for accumulating the tendencies 
leading to Knowledge; <i>jnanavan</i>, the man of Knowledge, who
has got his Knowledge matured; directly
<i>prapadyate</i>, attains; <i>mam</i>, Me, Vasudeva, who am
the inmost Self; (realizing) - In what way? <i>iti</i>, that;
Vasudeva is <i>sarvam</i>, all. <i>Sah</i>, such a one, who
realizes Me thus as the Self of all; is <i>mahatma</i>, 
a high-souled one. There is none else who can equal or
excel him. Therefore he is <i>su-durlabhah</i>, very rare
among thousands of men, as it has been said (in
verse 3). The reason why one does not realize that
all this is verily Vasudeva, the Self, is being stated
in the next verse.</p>
