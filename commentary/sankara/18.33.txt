    O Partha, <i>dhrtya</i>, the firmness; (is connected with the remote word) <i>avyabhicarinya</i>, that is 
    unfailing; <i>yogena</i>, through concentration, i.e. (the firmness that is) ever associated with samadhi 
    (absorption in Brahman); <i>yaya</i>, with which; <i>dharayate</i>, one restrains; What? 
    <i>manah-prana-indriya-kriyah</i>, the functions of the mind, vital forces and organs-restrains them from 
    tending towards the path opposed to the scriptures. Indeed, when restrained with firmness, they do not incline 
    towards objects prohibited by the scriptures.

    <i>Sa</i>, that; <i>dhrtih</i>, firmness, which is of this kind; is <i>sattviki</i>, born of sattva. What is 
    mean is that when one restrains the functions of the mind, vital forces and organs with unfailing firmness, 
    one does so through yoga, concentration.
