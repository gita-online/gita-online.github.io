O Partha, <i>kaccit etat</i>, has this that has been said by Me; been <i>srutam</i>, listened to, 
grasped through hearing; <i>ekagrena</i>, with a none-pointed; <i>cetasa</i>, mind. Or have 
you been inattentive? O Dhananjaya, <i>kaccit</i>, has; <i>te</i>, your; <i>ajnanasammohah</i>, 
delusion caused by ignorance, bewilderment, natural indiscrimination; been <i>pranastah</i>, 
destroyed, for which purpose has there been this effort on your part for hearing the Scripture, 
and on My part, the effort of being a teacher?
