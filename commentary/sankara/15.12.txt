    <i>Yat</i>, that which is; <i>aditya-gatam</i>, in the sun, which abides in the sun; What is that? the <i>tejah</i>, light, brilliance, radiance; which 
    <i>bhasayate</i>, illumines, reveals; <i>akhilam</i>, the whole, entire; <i>jagat</i>, world; <i>yat</i>, that ulluminating light which is; <i>candramasi</i>, 
    in the moon; <i>ca</i>, and <i>yat</i>, which is; <i>agnau</i>, in fire, the carrier of oblations; <i>viddhi</i>, know; <i>tat</i>, that; <i>tejah</i>, light; 
    to be <i>mamakam</i>, Mine.

    That light belongs to Me who is Visnu. Or: The light that is Consciousness, which is in the sun, which is in the moon, and which is in fire, know that light to be 
    Mine. That light belongs to Me who am Visnu.

    <b>Objection</b>: Is it not that the light that is Consciousness exists equally in the moving and the non-moving? Such being the case, why is this particular mention, 
    'That light in the sun which...etc.,'?

    <i>Reply</i>: This defect does not arise, because, owing to the abundance of the sattva quality, there can be an abundane (of Consciousness). Since in the sun etc. 
    the sattva is very much in evidence, is greatly brilliant, therefore there is an abundance of the light (of Consciousness) in them alone. And so it (sun etc.) is 
    specially mentioned. But it is not that it (Consciousness) is abundant only there. Indeed, as in the world, a face, though in the same position, is not reflected 
    in wood, a wall, etc., but in a mirror etc. it is reflected according to the degree in which they are more and more transparent, so is it here.
