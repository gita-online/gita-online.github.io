<p>A yogi, <i>nihsprhah</i>, who has become free from
hankering, thirst; <i>sarva-kamebhyah</i>, for all
desirable objects, seen and unseen; is <i>tada</i>, then;
<i>ucyate</i>, said to be; <i>yuktah</i>, Self-absorbed; <i>yada</i>,
when; the <i>viniyatam</i>, controlled; <i>cittam</i>, mind, the
mind that has been made fully one-pointed by
giving up thought of external objects; <i>avatisthate</i>,
rests; <i>atmani eva</i>, in the non-dual Self alone, i.e. he
gets established in his own Self. An illustration is
being given for the mind of that yogi which has
become Self-absorbed in the next verse.</p>
