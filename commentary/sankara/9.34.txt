<i>Manmana bhava</i>, have your mind fixed on Me; and also be <i>madbhakah</i>, 
devoted to Me. <i>Madyaji</i>, sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. 
And <i>namaskuru</i>, bow down; only <i>mam</i>, to Me. <i>Yuktva</i>, by 
concentrating your mind; and <i>mat parayanah</i>, by accepting Me as the supreme 
Goal; <i>esyasi eva</i>, you shall surely attain; <i>mam</i>, Me who am God. 
You shall attain Me <i>evam atmanam</i>, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the 
Self of all the beings, and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. 
In this way, the word atmanam (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word 
mam (Me). This is the purport.
