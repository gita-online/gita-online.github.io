    But, <i>asya</i>, its-of this Tree of the World which has been described; <i>rupam</i>, form, as it has been presented; <i>na</i>, is not at all; 
    <i>upalabhyate</i>, perceived; <i>iha</i>, here; <i>tatha</i>, in that way. For, being like a dream, water in a mirage, jugglery, an imaginary 
    city seen in the sky, it is by nature destroyed no sooner than it is seen. Therefore, <i>na</i>, there exists neither; its <i>antah</i>, end, 
    limit, termination; so also, neither; its beginning.

    It is not comprehended by anyone that it comes into existence beginning from any definite point. Its <i>sampratistha</i>, continuance, the 
    middle state, too, is not perceived by anyone. <i>Chittva</i>, after felling, uprooting, together with its seeds; <i>enam</i>, this, above 
    described; <i>asvattham</i>, Peepul, the Tree of the World; <i>suvirudha-mulam</i>, whose roots (mula) are well (su) developed (virudham); 
    <i>drdhena</i>, with the strong-hardened by a resolute mind directed towards the supreme Self, and sharpened on the stone of repeated practice 
    of discrimination; <i>asanga-sastrena</i>, sword of detachment-detachment means turn ing away from the desire for progeny, wealth and the worlds; 
    with that sword of detachment.
