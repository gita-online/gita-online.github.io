A yogi, <i>jnana-vijnana-trpta-atma</i>, whose mind is satisfied with knowledge and realization-jnana is thorough knowledge of things presented by the scriptures, but vijnana is making those things known from the scriptures a subject of one's own realization just as they have been presented; he whose mind (atma) has become contented (trpta) with those <i>jnana</i> and <i>vijnana</i> is <i>jnana-vijnana-trpta atma</i>-; <i>kutasthah</i>, who is unmoved, i.e. who becomes unshakable; and <i>vijita-indriyah</i>, who has his organs under control;- he who is of this kind, <i>ucyate</i>, is said to be; <i>yuktah</i>, Self-absorbed.

That yogi <i>sama-losta-asma-kancanah</i>, treats equally a lump of earth, a stone, and gold.
