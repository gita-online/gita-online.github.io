    <i>Yasmat</i>, since; <i>aham</i>, I; am <i>atitah</i>, transcendental; <i>ksaram</i>, to the mutable-I am beyond the Tree of Maya, called the Peepul Tree, which this 
    worldly existence is; and <i>uttamah</i>, above, most excellent or the highest; as compared with <i>api</i>, even; the <i>akasarat</i>, immutable, which is the seed 
    of the Tree of worldly existence; <i>atah</i>, hence, by virtue of being the most excellent as compared with the mutable and the immutable; <i>aham</i>, I; am 
    <i>prathitah</i>, well known; <i>loke</i>, in the world; and <i>vede</i>, in the Vedas; as <i>purusottamah</i>, the supreme Person.
