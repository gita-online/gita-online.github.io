For, O mighty-armed one, he who is free from duality becomes easily freed from bondage. That performer of Karma-yoga, 
<i>yah</i>, who; <i>na dvesti</i>, does not hate anything; and <i>na kanksati</i>, does not crave; jneyah, should be 
known; as <i>nitya-sannyasi</i>, a man of constant renunciation.<br><br>

The meaning is that he who continues to be like this in the midst of sorrow, happiness and their sources should be 
known as a man of constant renunciation, even though engaged in actions.<br><br>

<i>Hi</i>, for; <i>mahabaho</i>, O mighty-armed one; <i>nirdvandvah</i>, one who is free from duality; <i>pramucyate</i>, 
becomes freed; <i>sukham</i>, easily, without trouble; <i>bandhat</i>, from bondage. It is reasonable that in the case 
of renunciation and Karma-yoga, which are opposed to each other and can be undertaken by different persons, there should 
be opposition even between their results; but it canot be that both of them surely lead to Liberation. When such a 
question arises, this is the answer stated in the next verse.
