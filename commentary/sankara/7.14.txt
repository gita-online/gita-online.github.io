<p><i>Hi</i>, since; <i>esa</i>, this, aforesaid; <i>daivi</i>, divine;
<i>Maya mama</i>, of Mine, of God, of Visnu, which
(Maya) is My own; and which is <i>guna-mayi</i>,
constituted by the gunas; is <i>duratyaya</i>, difficult to
cross over; therefore, this being so, <i>ye</i>, those who;
wholeheartedly <i>prapadyante</i>, take refuge; <i>mam
eva</i>, in Me alone, in Me who am the Master of
Maya and who am their own Self, by giving up all
forms of rites and duties; <i>te</i>, they; <i>taranti</i>, cross
over; <i>etam</i>, this; <i>mayam</i>, Maya, which deludes all
beings. That is to say, they become freed from the
bondage of the world. 'If it is that those who resort
to You cross over this Maya, why then do not all
take refuge in You alone?' This is being answered
in the next verse.</p>
