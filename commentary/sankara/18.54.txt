<i>Brahma-bhutah</i>, one who has become Brahman, attained Brahman through the above process; 
and <i>prasanna-atma</i>, has attained the blissful Self, the indwelling Self; <i>na</i>, 
does not; <i>socati</i>, grieve-does not lament for the loss of something or the lack of 
some quality in oneself; nor <i>kanksati</i>, desire. By saying 'he does not grieve nor 
desire', this nature of one who has attained Brahman is being restated. For it 
does not stand to reason that in the case of a knower of Brahman there can be any hankering 
for something unattained. Or, (in place of kanksati) teh reading may be na hrsyati, does 
not become elated. Becoming <i>samah</i>, the same; <i>sarvesu bhutesu</i>, towards all being 
i.e., he verily judges what is happiness and sorrow in all beings by the samestandard as he 
would apply to himself (cf. 6.32); but the meaning is not 'seeing the Self alike in all 
beings', for this will be spoken of in (the next verse), 'Through devotion he knows Me'-; he, 
the one who is of this kind and steadfast in Knowledge, <i>labhate</i>, attains; <i>param</i>, 
supreme; <i>madbhaktim</i>, devotion to Me, to the supreme Lord; (he attains) devotion 
which is described as Knowledge, as the 'fourth' in, '...four classes of people...adore Me' 
(7.16).
