<p><i>Mahabaho</i>, O Mighty-armed one; <i>ubhayavibhrastah</i>,
fallen from both, having fallen from the
Path of Action and the Path of Yoga; <i>apratisthah</i>,
without support; <i>vimudhah</i>, deluded-having
become deluded; <i>brahmanah pathi</i>, on the path of
Brahman, on the path leading to Brahman; <i>kaccit
na</i>, does he not; <i>nasyati</i>, get ruined; <i>iva</i>, like; a
<i>chinna-abhram</i>, scattered cloud? Or is it that he
does not?</p>
