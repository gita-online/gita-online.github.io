<i>Hi</i>, indeed; <i>na vidyate</i>, there is nothing; <i>pavitram</i>, purifying, sanctifying; <i>iha</i>, here; 
<i>sadrsam</i>, comparable; <i>jnanena</i>, to Knowledge. <i>Yoga-samsiddhah</i>, one who has become perfected, who as 
attained fitness through yoga-the seeker after Liberation who has become <i>samsiddhah</i>, purified, qualified; 
<i>yogena</i>, through the yoga of Karma and the yoga of concentration; <i>kalena</i>, after a long time; <i>vindati</i>, 
realizes, i.e. attains; <i>tat</i>, That, Knowledge; verily <i>svayam</i>, by himself; <i>atmani</i>, in his own heart. 
That means by which Knowledge is invariably attained is being taught in the next verse.
