<p>
    <i>Aham</i>, I; am <i>samah</i>, impartial, equal; <i>sarva bhutesu</i>, towards all 
    beings; <i>me</i>, to Me; <i>na asti</i>, there is none; <i>dvesyah</i>, detestable; 
    <i>na</i>, none; <i>priyah</i>, dear. 
</p>

<p>
    I am like fire: As fire does not ward off cold from those who are afar, but removes 
    it from those who apporach, near, similarly I favour the devotees, not others.
</p> 

<p>
    <i>Tu</i>, but; <i>ye</i>, those who approach near, similarly I favour the devotees, 
    not others. <i>Tu</i>, but; <i>ye</i>, those who; <i>bhajanti</i>, worship Me, God; 
    <i>bhaktya</i>, with devotion; <i>te</i> they; exist <i>mayi</i>, in Me - by their 
    very nature; they do not exist in Me because of My love, <i>Ca</i>, and; <i>aham</i>, I; 
    <i>api</i>, too; naturally exist <i>tesu</i>, in them, not in others. 
</p>

<p>Thus there is no hatred towards them (the latter). </p>
