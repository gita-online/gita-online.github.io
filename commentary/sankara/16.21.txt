<i>Idam</i>, this; <i>dvaram</i>, door; <i>narakasya</i>, of hell for entering it; which is the <i>nasanam</i>, destroyer; <i>atmanah</i>, of the soul; is 
trividham of three kinds. It is that by the mere entry into which the soul perishes, i.e., it ceases to be fit for attaining any human goal. hence it is 
said that it is the door which is the destroyer of the soul. Which is that? <i>Kamah</i>, passion; <i>krodhah</i>, anger; and also <i>lobhah</i>, greed. <i>Tasmat</i>, 
therefore; <i>tyajet</i>, one shoud forsake; <i>etat trayam</i>, these three. Since this door is the destroyer of the soul, therefore one should renounce this 
group of three-passion etc. This is a eulogy of renunciation.
