<i>Iccha</i>, desire: Having experienced again an object of that kind which had given him the feeling of 
pleasure earlier, a man wants to have it under the idea that it is a source of pleasure. That is this 
desire which is an attribute of the internal organ, and is the 'field' since it is an object of 
knowledge. So also <i>dvesah</i>, repulsion, Having experienced again an object of that kind which he 
had earlier felt as a cause of sorrow, he hates it. That is this repulsion, and it is surely the 'field' 
since it is an object of knowledge. 

Similarly, <i>sukham</i>, happiness - which is favourable, <i>tranquil</i>, having the quality of sattva -
is the 'field' since it is an object of knowledge. <i>Duhkham</i>, sorrow-which is by nature adverse, that, 
too, is the 'field' since it is a knowable. <i>Sanghatah</i> is the aggregate, the combination, of 
body and organs. <i>Cetana</i>, sentience, is a state of the internal organ, manifest in that aggregate 
like fire in a heated lump of iron, and pervaded by an essence in the form of a semblance of 
Consciousness of the Self. That too is the 'field' because it is an object of knowledge. <i>Dhrtih</i>, 
fortitude, by which are sustained the body and organs when they get exhausted-that too is the 'field' 
becuase it is an object of knowledge. Desire etc. have been selected as suggestive of all the qualities 
of the internal organ. 

The Lord concludes what has been said: <i>Etat</i>, this; <i>ksetram</i>, field; <i>savikaram</i>, 
together with its modifications beginning from mahat (buddhi); has been <i>samasena</i>, briefly; 
<i>udahrtam</i>, spoken of. That 'field' which was referred to as, 'This body is called the field' 
(1), and is constituted by the aggregate of the constituents of the field has been explained in its 
different forms beginning from the great elements etc. ending with fortitude. The Knower of the field 
whose qualities are going to be described, and by realizing which Knower of the field along with His 
majesty Immortality follows of Him, together with His attributes, the Lord Himself will narrate in the 
verse, 'I shall speak of that which is to be known' (12). But, for the present, the Lord enjoins the 
group of disciplines characterized as humility etc. which lead one to the knowledge of That (Knower of 
the field)-that group of humility etc. which are referred to by the word Knowledge since they lead to 
Knowledge, and owing to the existence of which one becomes appropriately competent for the realization 
of that Knowable, and being endued with which a monk is said to be steadfast in Knowledge in the next
verse.
