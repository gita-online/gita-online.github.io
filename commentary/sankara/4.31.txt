<i>Yajna-sista-amrta-bhujah</i>, those who partake of the nectar left over after a sacrifice, i.e. 
those who, after performing the sacrifices described above, eat, during the leisure after the sacrifice, 
the food called nectar, as prescribed by the injunctions; <i>yanti</i>, reach; <i>sanatanam brahma</i>, 
the eternal Brahman. For the sake of consistency (with the Upanisads) it is understood that if they 
(the sacrificers) are seekers of liberation, (then they reach Brahman) in due course of time. 
The Upanisads describe the different stages through which those who do good deeds and practise 
meditation have to pass before reaching the qualified Brahman after death. For liberation there is need 
also of purification of the heart, Thus, they reach Brahman by stages, and not immediately after 
death. (See Ch. 8.5 and subsequent portion; also, Br. 4.3.35 to 4.4.25, etc.)<br><br>

Even <i>ayam lokah</i>, this world, common to all beings; <i>na asti</i>, ceases to exist; 
<i>ayajnasya</i>, for one who does not perform sacrifices, for him who does not have to his 
credit even a single one of the above sacrifices. <i>Kutah anyah</i>, what to speak of the 
other world which can be achieved through special disciplines; <i>kurusattama</i>, O best among 
the Kurus!
