<p>This being so, i.e. after reiterating (in the first
line of the present verse) the idea of full realization
contained in the previous verse, the result of that
(realization), viz Liberation, is being spoken of (in
the second line): The yogi, the man of full
realization; <i>vartate</i>, exists; <i>mayi</i>, in Me, in the
supreme state of Visnu; <i>sarvatha api</i>, in whatever
condition; <i>vartamanah</i>, he may be. He is verily
ever-free. The idea is that he is not obstructed from
Liberation by anything.</p>
