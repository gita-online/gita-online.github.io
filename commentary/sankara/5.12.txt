<i>Tyaktva</i>, giving up; <i>karma-phalam</i>, the result of work; <i>yuktah</i>, 
by becoming resolute in faith, by having this conviction thus - 'Actions 
are for God, not for my gain'; <i>apnoti</i>, attains; <i>santim</i>, 
Peace, called Liberation; <i>naisthikim</i> arising from steadfastness. 
It is to be understood that he attains this through the stages of 
purification of the heart, acquisition of Knowledge, renunciation of all 
actions, and steadfastness in Knowledge. On the other hand, however, he who 
is <i>ayuktah</i>, lacking in resolute faith; he, phale saktah, being 
attached to result; thinking, 'I am doing this work for my gain'; 
<i>kama-karena</i>, under the impulsion of desire - kara is the same as 
karana (action); the action of desire <i>kama-kara</i>; under that 
impulsion of desire, i.e. being prompted by desire; <i>nibadhyate</i>, 
gets bound.<br><br>

Therefore you become resolute in faith. This is the idea. But one who has 
experienced the supreme Reality.
