    <i>Ca</i>, and; <i>avisya</i>, entering; <i>gam</i>, the earth; <i>aham</i>, I; <i>dharayami</i>, sustain; <i>bhutani</i>, the beings, the world; <i>ojasa</i>, 
    through (My) power, the power that belongs to God and is free from passing and attachment, (and) which has penetrated the earth to support it, and owing to which 
    the heavy earth does not fall and does not crumble. There is a similar mantra: 'By which the heaven is made mighty, and the earth firm' (Tai. Sam. 4.1.8.5), and 
    also, 'He supported the earth' (op.cit., 4.1.8.3), etc. Hence, it has rightly been said, 'Entering the earth I sustain the moving and non-moving beings.' 
    Moreover, <i>pusnami</i>, I nourish, I make healthy and full of the sweet flavour of juices; <i>sarvah</i>, all; <i>osadhih</i>, the plants-paddy, barley, etc.; 
    <i>bhutva</i>, by becoming; <i>somah</i>, Soma; <i>rasatmakah</i>, which is of the nature of sap. Soma consists of all the juices; it is the source of all juices.
