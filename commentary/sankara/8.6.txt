<p><i>O Son of Kunti</i>, smaran, thinking of; <i>bhavam</i>,
any entity, any particular deity; <i>yam yam va api</i>,
which ever it may be; <i>tyajati</i>, one gives up; the
<i>kalevaram</i>, body; <i>ante</i>, at the end, at the time of the
departure of life; <i>eti</i>, he attains; <i>tam tam eva</i>, that
very one, that very entity which is rememberedâ€”none
else; having been <i>sada</i>, always; <i>tadbhavabhavitah</i>,
engrossed in its thought. Engrossment in
it is <i>tad-bhavah</i>; one by whom that is remembered
as a matter of habitual recollection is <i>tadbhavabhavitah</i>.
Since the last thought is thus the cause of
acquiring the next body.</p>
