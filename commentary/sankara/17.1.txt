    <i>Tu</i>, but; of Krsna, <i>ka</i>, what; is the <i>nistha</i>, state; <i>tesam</i>, of those-whosoever they may be; <i>ye</i>, who; being <i>anvitah</i>, endued; 
    <i>sraddhaya</i>, with faith, with the idea that there is something hereafter; <i>yajante</i>, adore gods and others; <i>utsriya</i>, by ignoring, setting aside; 
    <i>sastra-vidhim</i>, the unjunctions of the scriptures, the injunctions of the Vedas and the Smrtis? Is the state of those who are such <i>sattvam</i>, sattva; 
    <i>aho</i>, or; <i>rajah</i>, rajas; or <i>tamah</i>, tamas?

    This is what is meant: Does the adoration of gods and others that they undertake come under the category of sattva or rajas or tamas? By 'those who, endued with 
    faith, adore by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures' are here meant those who, not finding any injunction which can be characterized as 'enjoined by the 
    Vedas' 'or enjoined by the Smrtis', worship gods and others by merely observing the conduct of their elders. But, on the other hand, those who, though aware of 
    some scriptural injunction, discard them and worship the gods and others in ways contrary to the injunctions, are not meant here by 'those who, ignoring scriptural 
    injunctions, adore...' Why? Because of the qualifying phrase, 'being endued with faith'. For, it cannot be imagined that even when they are aware of some scriptural 
    injunction about worship of gods and others, they discard this out of their faithlessness, and yet they engage in the worship of gods and others enjoined by those 
    scriptures by becoming imbued with faith! Therefore, by 'those who, endued with faith, adore by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures' are here meant those 
    very ones mentioned earlier. An answer to this question relating to a general topic cannot be given without splitting it up.
