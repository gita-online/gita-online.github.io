<p><i>Me</i>, My; <i>matih</i>, conviction; is <i>iti</i>, that; <i>Yoga</i> is
<i>dusprapah</i>, difficult to be attained; <i>asamyataatmana</i>,
by one of uncontrolled mind, by one who
has not controlled his mind, the internal organ, by
practice and detachment. <i>Tu</i>, but, on the other
hand; <i>sakyah</i>, Yoga is possible; <i>avaptum</i>, to be
attained; <i>yatata</i>, by one who strives, who
repeatedly makes effort; <i>upayatah</i>, through the
means described above; and <i>vasyatmany</i>, by one of
controlled mind, by him whose mind has been
brought under control through practice and
detachment. As to that, by accepting the practice of
Yoga, actions leading to the attainment of this or
the next world may be renounced by a yogi, and
yet he may not attain the result of perfection in
Yoga, i.e. full Illumination, which is the means to
Liberation. Consequently, at the time of death his
mind may waver from the path of Yoga.
Apprehending that he may be thereby ruined.</p>
