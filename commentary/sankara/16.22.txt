passion etc. which are doors to the darkness of hell consisting of sorrow and delusion; freed from three three which are such, acarati, strives for; for what? 
<i>sreyah</i>, the good; <i>atmanah</i>, of the soul: debarred by which (doors) he could not strive earlier, and on the dispelling of which he strives. <i>Tatah</i>, 
thereby, as a result of that striving; <i>yati</i>, he attains; the param, supreme; <i>gatim</i>, Goal, i.e. Liberation, as well. The scripture is instrumental in 
this complete renunciation of the demoniacal qualities and striving for what is good. Both can be undertaken on the authority of the scriptures, not otherwise.
