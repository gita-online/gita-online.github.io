<p><i>Harayan</i>, holding; <i>kaya-siro-girvam</i>, the
body (torso), head, and neck; <i>samam</i>, erect; and
<i>acalam</i>, still - movement is possible for one (even
while) holding these erect; therefore, it is specified,
'still'; <i>sthirah</i>, being steady, i.e. remaining steady;
<i>sampreksya</i>, looking <i>svam nasikagram</i>, at the tip of his
own nose - looking at it intently, as it were; <i>ca</i>, and;
<i>anavalokayan</i>, not looking; <i>disah</i>, around, i.e. not
glancing now and then in various directions-. The
words 'as it were' are to be understood because
what is intended here is not an injunction for
looking at the tip of one's nose!</p>

<p>What then? It is the fixing the gaze of the eyes by withdrawing it
from external objects; and that is enjoined with a
view to concentrating the mind. If the intention were
merely the looking at the tip of the nose, then the
mind would remain fixed there itself, not on the
Self! In, 'Making the mind fixed in the Self' (25), the
Lord will speak of concentrating the mind verily
on the Self.</p>

<p>Therefore, owing to the missing word
<i>iva</i> (as it were), it is merely the withdrawal of the
gaze that is implied by <i>sampreksya</i> (looking).
Further, <i>prasantatma</i>, with a placid mind, with a
mind completely at peace; <i>vigata-bhih</i>, free from
fear; <i>sthitah</i>, firm; <i>brahmacari-vrate</i>, in the vow of a
celibate, the vow consisting in service of the teacher,
eating food got by begging, etc. - firm in that, i.e. he
should follow these; besides, <i>mat-cittah</i>, with the
mind fixed on Me who am the supreme God;
<i>samyamya</i>, by controlling; <i>manah</i>, the mind, i.e. by
stopping the modifications of the mind; <i>yuktah</i>,
through concentration, i.e. by becoming
concentrated; <i>asita</i>, he should remain seated;
<i>matparah</i>, with Me as the supreme Goal.</p>

<p>Some passionate person may have his mind on a woman,
but he does not accept the woman as his supreme
Goal. What then? He accepts the king or Sive as his
goal. But this one (the yogi) not only has his mind
on Me but has Me as his Goal. After that, now is
being stated the result of Yoga in the next verse.</p>
