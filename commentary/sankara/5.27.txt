<i>Krtva</i>, keeping; <i>bahyan</i>, the external; <i>sparsan</i>, objects, sound etc.; <i>bahih</i>, outside: To one who does 
not pay attention to the external objects like sound etc., brought to the intellect through the ear etc., the objects become 
verily kept outside. Having kept them out in this way, and (keeping) the <i>caksuh</i>, eyes; <i>antare</i>, at the juncture; 
<i>bhruvoh</i>, of the eye-brows; and similarly, <i>samau krtva</i>, making equal; <i>prana-apanau</i>, the outgoing and the 
incoming breaths; <i>nasa-abhyantara-carinau</i>, that move through the nostrils; munih, the contemplative-derived (from the 
root man) in the sense of contemplating, the monk; <i>yata-indriya mano-buddhih</i>, who has control over his organs, mind 
and intellect; should be <i>moksa-para-yanah</i>, fully intent on Liberation-keeping his body is such a posture, the contemplative 
should have Liberation itself as the supreme Goal. He should be <i>vigata-iccha-bhaya-krodhah</i>, free from desire, fear and anger. 
The monk <i>yah</i>, who; <i>sada</i>, ever remains thus; <i>sah</i>, he; is <i>muktah yah</i>, who; <i>sada</i>, ever remains thus; 
sah, he; is <i>muktah</i>, ever, verily free. He has no other Liberation to seek after.<br><br> 

What is there to be realized by one who has his mind thus concentrated? The answer to this is in the next verse.
