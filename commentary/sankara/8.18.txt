<p><i>Ahar-agame</i>, with the coming of day, at the
time when Brahma wakes; <i>sarvah vyaktayah</i>, all
manifested things, all things that get manifested,
all creatures characterized as moving and non-moving;
<i>prabhavanti</i>, emerge, become manifested;
<i>avyaktat</i>, from the Unmanifestedâ€”avyakta
(Unmanifested) is the state of sleep of Prajapati;
from that avyakta. Similarly, <i>ratri-agame</i>, when
night comes, at the time when Brahma sleeps;
<i>praliyante</i>, they, all the manifested things, merge;
<i>tatra eva</i>, in that itself; <i>avyakta-sanjnake</i>, which is
called the Unmanifested referred to above.</p>

<p>In order to obviate the defect of the emergence of some
unmerited result and the destruction of merited
results; for pointing out the meaningfulness
of the scriptures dealing with
bondage and Liberation; and with a view to
propounding detachment from the world on the
ground that the helpless multitude of beings
perishes after being born again and again under
the influence of accumulated results of actions that
have for their origin such evils as ignorance etc., the
Lord says the next verse.</p>
