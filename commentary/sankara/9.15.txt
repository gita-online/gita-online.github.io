<i>Anye</i>, others, giving up others forms of adoration; <i>ca</i>, verily; 
<i>upasate</i>, worship; <i>mam</i>, Me, God; <i>yajantah</i>, by adoring, glorifying; 
<i>api</i>, exclusively; <i>jnana-yajnene ekatvena</i>, through the sacrifice of 
the knowledge of oneness - knowledge of God itself being the sacrifice; and that 
knowledge consists in the realization of the highest truth that the supreme Brahman 
is verily one. Adoring with that (knowledge) they worship Me. And some others 
<i>prthaktvena</i>, multifariously in different forms as the sun, moon, etc. 

They worship (Me) by thinking that, Visnu who is God Himself exists in different 
forms as the sun etc. Still others worship Me thinking that, that very God who is 
visvatomukhah, mulitiformed, who has His facr everywhere, i.e., who is the Cosmic 
Person; exists <i>bahudha</i>, variously. In numerous ways they worship Him, 
the Cosmic Person, who has His face everywhere. 'If they worship in numerous ways, 
how is it that they worship You alone?' Hence the Lord says the next verse.
