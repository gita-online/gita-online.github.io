<p><i>A yogi</i> is adhikah, higher; <i>tapasvibhyah</i>, than
men of austerity; he is matah, considered; adhikah,
higher than, superior to; api, even; <i>jnanibhyah</i>,
men of knowledge. <i>Jnana</i> here means scriptural
learning. (A yogi is superior) to even those who
possess that (learning). <i>The yogi</i> is adhikah, higher,
greater; <i>karmibhyah</i>, than men of action - karma
means Agnihotra etc.; (greater) than those who
adhere to them. Since this is so, <i>tasmat</i>, therefore;
O Arjuna, <i>bhava</i>, do you become a yogi.</p>
