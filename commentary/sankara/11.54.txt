    <i>Tu</i>, but, O Arjuna; <i>bhaktya</i>, by devotion. Of what kind? To this the Lord says: 
    <i>Ananyaya</i>, by (that devotion which is) single-minded. That is called single-minded devotion which 
    does not turn to anything else other than the Lord, and owing to which nothing else but Vasudeva is 
    perceived by all the organs. 
</p>

<p>
    With that devotion, <i>aham sakyah</i>, am I able; <i>evamvidhah</i>, in this form - in the aspect of the 
    Cosmic form; <i>jnatum</i>, to be known - from the scriptures; not merely to be known from the scriptures, 
    but also <i>drastum</i>, to be seen, to be realized directly; <i>tattvena</i>, in reality; and also 
    <i>ravestum</i>, to be entered into - for attaining Liberation; <i>parantapa</i>, O destroyer of foes. 
</p>

<p>
    Now the essential purport of the whole scripture, the Gita, which is meant for Liberation, is being stated by 
    summing it up so that it may be practised in the next verse.
