    <i>Aneka-citta-vibhrantah</i>, bewildered by numerous thoughts, confounded variously by thoughts of the kind stated above; <i>moha-jala samavrtah</i>, caught in the 
    net of delusion-moha is non-discrimination, lack of understanding; that itself is like a net because of its nature of covering; enshrouded by that; <i>prasaktah</i>, 
    engrossed; <i>kama bhogesu</i>, in the enjoyment of desirable objects, being immersed in that itself; they patanti, fall, owing to the sins accumulated thereby; 
    <i>asucau</i>, into a foul; <i>narake</i>, hell, such as Vaitarani.

    <b>Vaitarani</b>: It is the most terrible place of punishment; a river filled with all kinds of filth-blood, hair, bones etc., and running with great impetuosity, 
    hot and fetid. The other hells are Tamisra, Andhatamisra, Raurava, Kumbhipaka, and so on.
