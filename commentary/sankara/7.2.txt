<p><i>Aham</i>, I; <i>vaksyami</i>, shall tell; <i>te</i>, you; <i>asesatah</i>,
in detail, fully; of that Knowledge about Myself,
which is <i>idam</i>, this; <i>jnanam</i>, Knowledge; which is
<i>savijnanam</i>, combined with realization, associated
with personal enlightenment; <i>yat jnatva</i>, after
experiencing which Knowledge; <i>avasisyate</i>, there
remains; <i>na anyat</i>, nothing else, anything that can
be a means to human ends; <i>jnatavyam</i>, to be
known; <i>bhuyah</i>, again; <i>iha</i>, here.</p>

<p>(In this way) the Lord praises that Knowledge which is intended to
be spoken, in order to draw the attention of the
hearer. Thus, 'he who knows Me in reality becomes
omniscient.' This is the idea. Therefore Knowledge
is difficult to attain because of its superexcellent
result. How so? This is answered in the next verse.</p>
