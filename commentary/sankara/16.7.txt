<i>Na</i>, niether; do the <i>asurah</i>, demoniacal; <i>janah</i>, persons; <i>viduh</i>, understand; <i>pravritim</i>, what is to be done with regard to that 
which is a means to the human ends; and <i>nivirttim</i>, what is not to be done, the opposite of that (former) and from which source of evil one should desist. 
Nor only do they not know what is to be done and what is not to be done, <i>na</i>, nor; does <i>saucam</i>, purity; <i>na api</i>, or even; <i>acarah</i>, good 
conduct; or <i>satyam</i>, truthfulness; <i>vidyate</i>, exist; <i>tesu</i>, in them. The demons are verily bereft of purity and good conduct; they are deceitful 
and given to speaking lies.
