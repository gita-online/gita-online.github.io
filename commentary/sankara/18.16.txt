    Tatra is used for connecting with the topic under discussion. <i>Tatra evam sati</i>, this being the case, 
    when actions are thus accomplished by the five causes mentioned above; this portion has to be connected 
    with 'perverted intellect' by way of causality, <i>yah</i>, tu, anyone, an unenlightened person, who; 
    <i>pasyati</i>, perceives; <i>kevalam</i>, the absolute, pure; <i>atmanam</i>, Self; as the <i>kartaram</i>, 
    agent-thinking, 'I myself am the agent of the actions being done by them', as a consequence of imagining the 
    Self as identified with them; Why? <i>akrta-buddhitvat</i>, owing to the imperfection of his intellect, owing 
    to his intellect not having been refined by the instructions of Vedanta and the teachers, and by reasoning.
</p> 

<p>
    Even the person who, believing in the Self as distinct from the body etc., looks upon the distinct, absolute 
    Self as the agent, he, too, is surely of imperfect intellect. Hence, owing to his having an imperfect intellect, 
    <i>sah</i>, that man; <i>na</i>, does not; <i>pasyati</i>, perceive (properly) either the truth about the Self 
    or about actions. 
</p>

<p>
    This is the meaning. Therefore he is a durmatih, man of perverted intellect, in the sense that his intellect is 
    contemptible, perverse, corrupted, and the cause of repeatedly undergoing births and deaths. He does not 
    perceive even while seeing-like the man suffering from Timira seeing many moons, or like one thinking the 
    moon to be moving when (actually) the clouds are moving, or like the one seated on some conveyance 
    (e.g. palanquin), thinking oneself to be moving when others (the bearers) are moving.

<p>Who, again, is the man of right intellect who perceives correctly? This is being answered in the next verse.</p>
