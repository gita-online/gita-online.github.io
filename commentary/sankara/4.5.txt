O Arjuna, <i>bahuni</i>, many; <i>janmani</i>, lives; me, of Mine; <i>vyatitani</i>, have passed; <i>tava ca</i>, and so have 
yours. <i>Aham</i>, I; <i>veda</i> know; <i>tani</i>, them; <i>sarvani</i>, all; (but) <i>tvam</i>, you; <i>na vetta</i>, 
know not, due to your power of understanding being obstructed by righteousness, unrighteousness, etc. However, <i>parantapa</i>, 
O scorcher of foes; <i>aham</i>, I know, possessing as I do unobstructed power of knowledge, because by nature I am enternal, 
pure, enlightened and free.<br><br>

'In that case, how, in spite of the absence of righteousness and unrighteousness, can there be any birth for You who are the 
eternal God?' That is beng answered in the next verse.
