    <i>Adhyatma-jnana-nityatvam</i>, steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self: <i>adhyatma-jnanam</i> is 
    the knowledge of the Self, etc.; constant dwelling in that is nityatvam. <i>Tattva-jnanartha-darsanam</i>, 
    contemplating on the Goal of the knowledge of Reality: Tattva-jnanam is that (realization of Truth) 
    which arises from the fruition of application to the disciplines like humility etc. which are the means 
    to knowledge. Its Goal (artha) is Liberation, the cessation of mundane existence. Contemplation (darsana) 
    on that is tattva-jnana-artha-darsanam. 
</p>

<p>
    For, when one engages in contemplation on the result of the knowledge of Reality, one gets the urge to 
    undertake the disciplines which are its means. Etat, this-those that have been stated from 'humility' etc. 
    to 'contemplation on the Goal of the knowledge of Reality'; <i>proktam</i>, is spoken of; <i>iti</i>, as; 
    <i>jnanam</i>, Knowledge, because they are meant to lead one to Knowledge. <i>Ajnanam</i>, ignorance; is 
    <i>yat</i>, that which is; <i>anyatha</i>, other; <i>atah</i>, than this-what has been stated above.

<p>
    Contrarily, arrogance, pretentiousness, cruelty, revenge, insincerity, etc. are to be known as ignorance 
    so that, since they are the cause of the origination of worldly existence, they can be avoided. 
    To the question as to what is to be known through the aforesaid Knowledge, the Lord says, 'I shall speak 
    of that which is to be known,' etc. Objection: Do not humility etc. constitute yama and niyama? The 
    Knowable is not known through them. For humility etc. are not seen to determine the nature of anything. 
    Moreover, everywhere it is observed that whatever knowledge reveals its own object, that itself ascertains 
    the nature of that object of knowledge (the knowable). Indeed, nothing else is known through a knowledge 
    concerning some other object. As for instance, fire is not known through the knowledge of a pot.

    <b>Reply</b>: This is not a defect, for we have said that they are called 'Knowledge' because they lead 
    one to Knowledge, and because they are auxiliary causes of Knowledge.
