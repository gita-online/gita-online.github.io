That which is <i>daivi</i>, divine; <i>sampad</i>, nature; is <i>vimoksaya</i>, for Liberation from the bondage of the world. The <i>asuri</i>, demoniacal nature; 
<i>mata</i>, is considered to be; <i>nibandhaya</i>, for inevitable bondage. So also is the fiendish nature. Now, when such a statement was made, the Lord, 
noticing Arjuna having this kind of inner cogitation - 'Am I endowed with the demoniacal nature, or am I endowed with the divine nature?, says: <i>ma</i>, do not; 
<i>sacah</i>, grieve, O son of Pandu! <i>Asi</i>, you are; <i>abhijatah</i>, destined to have, born with the good fortune of having; <i>daivim</i>, the divine; 
<i>sampadam</i>, nature; i.e., you are destined for an illustrious future.
