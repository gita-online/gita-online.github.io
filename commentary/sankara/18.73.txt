    O <i>Acyuta</i>, (my) mohah, born of ignorance and the cause of all evil in the form of mundane 
    existence, and difficult to cross like an ocean;l nastah has been destroyed. And <i>smrtih</i>, 
    memory, regarding the reality of the Self-on the acquisition of which follows the loosening of all 
    the bonds; <i>labdha</i>, has been regained, <i>tvat-prasadat</i>, through Your grace <i>maya</i>, 
    by me, who am dependent on Your grace. By this question about the destruction of delusion and 
    the answer to it, it becomes conclusively revealed that the fruit derived from understanding 
    the import of the entire Scripture is this much alone-which is the destruction of delusion 
    arising from ignorance and the regaining of the memory about the Self. 
</p>

<p>
    And similarly, in the Upanisadic text beginning with 'I grieve because I am not a knower of 
    the Self' (Ch. 7.1.3), it is shown that all bonds become destroyed when the Self is realized. 
    There are also the words of the Upanisadic verses, 'The knot of the heart gets untied' 
    (Mu. 2.2.8); 'at that time (or to that Self) what delusion and what sorrow can there be for 
    that seer of oneness?' (Is.7). 
</p>

<p>
    Now then, <i>sthitah, asmi</i>, I stand under Your command; <i>gatasandehah</i>, with (my) doubts 
    removed. <i>Karisye</i>, I shall follow; <i>tava</i>, Your; <i>vacanam</i>, instruction. By Your 
    grace I have achieved the goal of life. The idea is, there is no duty, as such, for me. The 
    teaching of the Scripture is concluded. Thereafter, now in order to show the connection (of this) 
    with the (main) narrative.
