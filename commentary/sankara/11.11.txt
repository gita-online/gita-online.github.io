<i>Divya-malya-ambara-dharam</i>, wearing heavenly garlands and apparel-the God wearing celestial flowers and 
clothings; <i>divya-gandha anulepanam</i>, anointed with heavenly scents; <i>sarva ascaryamayam</i>, abounding 
in all kinds of wonder; <i>devam</i>, resplendent; <i>anantam</i>, infinite, boundless; and <i>visvato-mukham</i>, 
with faces everywhere - He being the Self of all beings. 'He showed (to Arjuna)', or 'Arjuna saw', is to be 
supplied. An illustration is once more being given of the effulgence of the Cosmic form of the Lord in the next
verse.
