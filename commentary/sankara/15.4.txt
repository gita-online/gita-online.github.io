    <i>Tatah</i>, thereafter; <i>tat</i>, that; <i>padam</i>, State of Visnu; <i>parimargitavyam</i>, has to be sought for, i.e. realized; <i>gatah</i>, 
    going, entering; <i>yasmin</i>, where, into which State; they <i>na</i>, do not; <i>nivartanti</i>, return; <i>bhuyah</i>, again, for worldly

    As to how It is to be sought for, the Lord says: <i>Prapadye</i>, I take refuge; <i>tam</i>, in that; <i>adyam</i>, Primeval-existing from the 
    beginning; purusam, Person, who has been mentioned by the word State; <i>eva</i>, Himself. The search has to be carried on thus, i.e., by 
    taking refuge in Him. Who is that Person? That is being stated: <i>Yatah</i>, from whom, from which Person; <i>prasrta</i>, has ensued, 
    like jugglery from a magician; <i>purani</i>, the eternal; <i>pravrttih</i>, Manifestation, the magic Tree of the World. What kind of persons 
    reach that State? This is being answered in the next verse.
