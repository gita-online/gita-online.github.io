<p>O son of Prtha, <i>sah</i>, that; <i>parah purusah</i>,
supreme, unsurpassable Person—(the word <i>purusa</i>)
derived in the sense of 'residing in the heart' or 'all-pervasiveness';
that Person, compared to whom there is nothing superior; 
<i>yasya</i>, in whom, in which Person; <i>antahsthani</i>, 
are included; <i>bhutani</i>, (all) the beings which are Its products—for a
product remains inherent in its cause; and <i>yena</i>, by
whom, by which Person; <i>tatam</i>, is pervaded;
<i>sarvam</i>, all; <i>idam</i>, this, the Universe, as pot etc. are
by space; <i>is tu</i>, indeed; <i>labhyah</i>, reached; through
<i>ananyaya</i>, one-pointed; <i>bhaktya</i>, through devotion,
characterized as Knowledge; <i>ananyaya</i>, which is
one pointed, which relates to the Self.</p>

<p>The Northern Path meant for the attainment of Brahman
by the yogis under discussion, who have
superimposed the idea of Brahman on the syllable
Om and who are destined to get Liberation in due
course, has to be stated. Hence, in order to present
the intended idea, the verse, '(O best of the Bharata
dynasty) of that time...at which,' etc. is being
recited. The description of the Path of Return (in
verse 25) is by way of praising the other Path (of
Departure, in verse 24) is in the next verse.</p>
