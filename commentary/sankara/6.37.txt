<p><i>O Krsna</i>, failing to achieve; <i>yogasam-siddhim</i>, perfection in Yoga, the result of
Yoga, i.e., full Illumination; <i>kam gatim</i>, what goal;
does one attain; who, though <i>upetah sraddhaya</i>, possessed of faith, belief in God and in
the other world; is <i>ayatih</i>, not diligent, devoid of
effort on the path of Yoga; and, at the time of
death, too, <i>calita-manasah</i>, whose mind becomes
deflected; <i>yogat</i>, from Yoga, (i.e.,) whose memory
has been lost?</p>
