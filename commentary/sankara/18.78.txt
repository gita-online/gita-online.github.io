To be brief, <i>yatra</i>, where, the side on which; there is <i>Krsna</i>, yogeswarah, the Lord of 
yogas-who is the Lord of all the yogas and the source of all the yogas, since they originate from Him; 
and <i>yatra</i>, where, the side on which; there is <i>Partha, dhanurdharah</i>, the wielder of the 
bow, of the bow called Gandiva; <i>tatra</i>, there, on that side of the Pandavas; are <i>srih</i>, 
fortune; <i>vijayah</i>, victory; and there itself is <i>bhutih</i>, prosperity, great abundance of 
fortune; and <i>dhruva</i>, unfailing; <i>nitih</i>, prudence. Such is <i>me</i>, my; <i>matih</i>, conviction.
