    <i>Tasmat</i>, therefore; <i>tvam</i>, you; <i>uttistha</i>, rise up; (and) <i>labhasva</i>, gain; the 
    <i>yasah</i>, fame, that Arjuna has conquered the Atirathas, Bhisma, Drona and others, who are unconquerable 
    even by the gods. Such fame can be acquired only by virtuous actions. <i>Jitva</i>, by defeating; <i>satrun</i>, 
    the enemies, Duryodhana and others; <i>bhunksva</i>, enjoy; a <i>rajyam</i>, kingdom; that is <i>samrddham</i>, 
    propersous, free from enemies and obstacles.

<p>
    <i>Ete</i>, these; <i>nihatah</i>, have been definitely killed, made lifeless; <i>eva maya</i>, verily by Me; 
    <i>eva purvam</i>, even earlier. <i>Bhava</i>, be you; <i>nimitta-matram</i>, merely an instrument, O Savyasachin. 
    Arjuna was called so because he could shoot arrows even with his left hand.
