viyogam</i>, severance (viyoga) of contact
(samyoga) with sorrow (duhkha); to be verily
<i>yoga-sanjnitam</i>, what is called Yoga - i.e. one should
know it through a negative definition. After
concluding the topic of the result of Yoga, the need
for pursuing Yoga is again being spoken of in
another way in order to enjoin 'perseverance' and
'freedom from depression' as the disciplines for
Yoga: <i>Sah</i>, that; <i>yogah</i>, Yoga, which has the results
as stated above; <i>yoktavyah</i>, has to be practiced;
<i>niscayena</i>, with perseverance; and <i>anirvinnacetasa</i>,

<p>That which is not depressed (<i>nirvinnam</i>) is <i>anirvinnam</i>. 
What is that? The heart. (One has to practice Yoga) with that
heart which is free from depression. This is the
meaning.</p>
