<p><i>Yoga-maya-samavrtah</i>, being enveloped by
yoga-maya - Yoga means the combination, the
coming together, of the (three) gunas; that
(combination) is itself maya, yoga-maya; being
enveloped, i.e. veiled, by that yoga-maya; <i>aham</i>, I;
na <i>prakasah</i>, do not become manifest; <i>sarvasya</i>, to
all, to the world. The idea is that I become manifest
only to some devotees of Mine. For this very
reason, <i>ayam</i>, this; <i>mudhah</i>, deluded; <i>lokah</i>,
world; na <i>abhijanati</i>, does not know; <i>mam</i>, Me;
who am <i>ajam</i>, birthless; and <i>avyayam</i>, undecaying. 'That 
yogamaya, because of My being covered by which the
world does not know Me - that yoga-maya, since it
belongs to Me, does not obstruct the knowlege of
Me who am God, the possessor of maya, just as the
magic of any other magician does not cover his
knowledge.'</p>
