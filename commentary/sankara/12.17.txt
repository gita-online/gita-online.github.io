<i>Yah</i>, he who; <i>na hrsyati</i>, does not rejoice on getting a coveted object; <i>na dvesti</i>, does not fret on getting an undesirable 
object; <i>na socati</i>, does not lament on the loss of a dear one; and <i>na kanksati</i>, does not hanker after an object not acquired; 
<i>subha-asubha-parityogi</i>, who gives up good and bad, who is apt to give up good and bad actions; <i>bhaktiman</i>, who is full of devotion - 
he is dear to Me.
