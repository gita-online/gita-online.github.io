<i>Asau</i>, that; unconquerable <i>satruh</i>, enemy, named Devadatta; <i>hatah</i>, has been killed; <i>naya</i>, by me; and <i>hanisye</i>, I shall kill; 
<i>aparan</i>, the other wretched ones. What will these pitiable persons do? There is none equal to me at all. <i>Aham</i>, I; am the <i>isvarah</i>, lord; I 
am the <i>bhogi</i>, enjoyer; and I am <i>siddhah</i>, well-established in every respect-I am blessed with sons, and grandsons born of sons and daughters. 
Not only am I a man, but I am also <i>balavan</i>, mighty; and I myself am <i>sukhi</i>, happy; others are born to be but a burden to the earth!
