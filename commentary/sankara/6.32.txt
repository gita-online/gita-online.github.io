<p><i>Atma-aupamyena</i>: <i>Atma</i> means the self, i.e.
oneself. That by which a comparison is made is an
<i>upama</i>. The abstract form of that is <i>aupamya</i>.
<i>Atma-aupamya</i> means a standard as would be
applicable to oneself. O Arjuna, <i>yah</i>, he who;
<i>pasyati</i>, judges; <i>sarvatra</i>, in all beings; <i>samam</i>, by
the same standard, in the same manner; <i>atma-aupamyena</i>,
as he would apply to himself. And
what does he view with sameness? That is being
stated: As <i>sukham</i>, happiness, is dear to me, so
also is happiness agreeable to all creatures. <i>Va</i>,
and - the word <i>va</i> is (used) in the sense of and; just
as <i>yadi</i>, whatever; <i>duhkham</i>, sorrow is
unfavourable, unwelcome to me, so also is sorrow
unwelcome and unfavourable to all creatures.</p>

<p>In this way, he looks upon happiness and sorrow as
pleasant and unpleasant to all beings, by the same
standard as he would apply to himself. He does
not act against anyone. That is, he is non-injurious.
He who is thus non-injurious and steadfast in full
Illumination, <i>sah</i>, that yogi; <i>paramah matah</i>, is
considered as the best among all the yogis.
Noticing that his Yoga - as spoken of and consisting
in full Illumination - is hard to acquire, Arjuna,
with a view to hearing the sure means to its
attainment, says the following verse.</p>
