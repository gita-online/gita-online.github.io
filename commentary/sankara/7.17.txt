Tesam, of them, among the four; jnani, the
man of Knowledge, the knower of Reality, is nityayuktah,
endowed with constant steadfastness as a
result of being a knower of Reality; and he also
becomes eka-bhaktih, endowed with one-pointed
devotion, because he finds no one else whom he
can adore. Consequently, that person of onepointed
devotion visisyate, excels, becomes
superior, i.e. he surpasses (the others). Hi, since; I,
the Self, am priyah, dear; jnaninah, to the man of
Knowledge; therefore aham, I; am atyartham, very
much; priyah, dear to him. It is indeed a well
known fact in the world that the Self is dear. The
meaning, therefore, is that Vasudeva, being the Self
of the man of Knowledge, is dear to him. And sah,
he, the man of Knowledge, being the very Self of
Me who am Vasudeva; is very much priyah, dear;
mama, to Me.

    <b>Opponent</b>: 'If that be so, then the other three-the
    afflicted and the others-are not dear to Vasudeva?'

<p>
    <b>Vedantin</b>: 'This is not so!'
</p> 

<p><b>Opponent</b>: 'What then?'</p>

<p>This is explained in the next verse.</p>
