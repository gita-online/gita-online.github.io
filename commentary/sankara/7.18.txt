<p><i>Sarve, ete</i>, all of these three, without
exception; are <i>eva</i>, indeed, <i>udarah</i>, noble, i.e.; they
are verily dear to Me. For, no devotee of Mine can
become disagreeable to Me who am Vasudeva. But
the man of Knowledge becomes very much dear.
This is the difference. Why is this so? In answer the
Lord says:</p>

<p><i>Tu</i> but; <i>jnani</i>, the man of Knowledge; is
<i>atma eva</i>, the very Self, not different from Me. This
is <i>me</i>, My; <i>matam</i>, opinion, conviction. <i>Hi</i>, for;
<i>yuktatma</i>, with a steadfast mind-having his mind
absorbed in the idea, 'I am verily Vasudeva, the
Lord, and none else', that man of Knowledge
<i>asthitah</i>, is set on the path leading to, he is engaged
in ascending to, going to; <i>mam eva</i>, Me alone, to
the supreme Brahman; who am the <i>anuttama
gatim</i>, super-excellent Goal to be reached.</p>
