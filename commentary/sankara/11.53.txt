    <i>Na vedaih</i>, not through the Vedas, not even through the four Vedas - Rk, Yajus, Sama and Atharvan; 
    <i>na tapasa</i>, not by austerity, not by severe austerities like the Candrayana; not <i>danena</i>, by 
    gifts, by gifts of cattle, land, gold, etc.; <i>na ca</i>, nor even; <i>ijyaya</i>, by sacrifices or worship; 
    <i>sakyah aham</i>, can I; <i>drastum</i>, be seen <i>evamvidhah</i>, in this form, in the manner as was 
    shown; <i>yatha</i>, as; <i>drstavan asi</i>, you have seen mam, Me.
