<p><i>Ete</i>, these two; <i>gati</i>, courses; <i>jagatah</i>, of the
world; which are <i>sukla-krsne</i>, white and black - white 
because it is a revealer of Knowledge, and 
black because there is absence of that (revelation); 
are <i>hi</i>, verily; <i>mate</i>, considered;
<i>sasvate</i>, eternal, because the world is eternal.</p>

<p>These two courses are possible for those who are
qualified for Knowledge and for rites and duties;
not for everybody. This being so, <i>ekaya</i>, by the one,
by the white one; <i>yati</i>, a man goes; <i>anavrttim</i>, to
the State of Non-return; <i>anyaya</i>, by the other;
<i>avartate</i>, he returns; <i>punah</i>, again.</p>
