<p><i>Iyam</i>, this; <i>prakrtih</i>, Prakrti, the
divine power called Maya; <i>me</i>, of Mine, as
described; <i>bhinna</i>, is divided; <i>astadha</i>, eight-fold;
<i>iti</i>, thus: <i>bhumih</i>, earth - not the gross earth but the
subtle element called earth, this being understood
from the statement, 'Prakrti (of Mine) is divided
eight-fold'. Similarly, the subtle elements alone are
referred to even by the words water etc. <i>Apah</i>,
water; <i>analah</i>, fire; <i>vayuh</i>, air; <i>kham</i>, space; <i>manah</i>,
mind.</p>

<p>By 'mind' is meant its source, egoism. By
<buddhih</i>, intellect, is meant the principle called
mahat, Mahat means Hiranyagarbha, or Cosmic
Intelligence, which is the source of egoism. By
<i>ahankarah</i>, egoism, is meant the Unmanifest,
associated with (Cosmic) ignorance. As food mixed with poison is
called poison, similarly, the Unmanifest, which is
the primordial Cause, is called egoism since it is
imbued with the impressions resulting from
egoism; and egoism is the impelling force (of all). It
is indeed seen in the world that egoism is the
impelling cause behind all endeavor.</p>
