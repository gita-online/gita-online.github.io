<p><i>Yesam jananam</i>, those persons; <i>tu</i>, on the
other hand; <i>punya-karmanam</i>, who are of virtuous
deeds, in whom exist virtuous deeds that are the
cause of purification of the mind; whose <i>papam</i>,
sin; <i>antagatam</i>, has come to an end, is almost
eradicated, attenuated; <i>te</i>, they; <i>dvandva-mohanirmuktah</i>,
being free from the delusion of duality
as described; and <i>drdhavratah</i>, firm in their
convictions-those who have the firm
knowledge that the supreme Reality is such alone
and not otherwise are called <i>drdhavratah</i>;
<bhajante, adore;</b> <i>mam</i>, Me, the supreme Self. Why
do they worship? This is being answered in the next
verse.</p>
