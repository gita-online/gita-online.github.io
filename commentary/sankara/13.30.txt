    And <i>yah</i>, he who; <i>pasyati</i>, sees, realizes; <i>karmani</i>, actions, those performed through speech, mind and body; 
    as <i>kriyamanani</i>, being done, being accomplished; <i>sarvasah</i>, in various ways; <i>prakrtya</i>, by Nature-Nature is 
    God's Maya consisting of the three qualities, as is said in the Upanisadic text, 'However, know Maya as Nature' (Sv. 4.10); 
    by that Nature; eva, itself-not by the other which transforms itself in the form of cause and effects such as Mahat etc.; 
    <i>tatha</i>, and also; <i>atmanam</i>, the Self, the Knower of the field; as <i>akartaram</i>, the non-agent, devoid of all 
    adjuncts; <i>sah</i>, he; <i>pasyati</i>, sees-he is the one who has realized the supreme Reality.

    This is the idea. What is implied is that there is no valid proof about differences in the Non-agent who is devoid of 
    qualities and is unconditioned like space. The Lord elaborates again in other words that very true knowledge in the next verse.
