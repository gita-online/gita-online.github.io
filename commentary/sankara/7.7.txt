<p>O Dhananjaya, <i>asti</i>, there is; <i>na anyat kincit</i>,
nothing else whatsoever, no other cause;
<i>parataram</i>, higher; <i>mattah</i>, than Me, the supreme
God; i.e. I Myself am the source of the world. Since
this is so, therefore, <i>sarvam</i>, all; <i>idam</i>, this, all
things, the Universe; <i>protam</i>, is strung, woven,
connected, i.e. transfixed; <i>mayi</i>, on Me, the
supreme God; like cloth in the warp, and <i>iva</i>, 
like; <i>maniganah</i>, pearls; <i>sutre</i>, on a string.</p>

<p>What qualities are You endowed with, by virtue of
which all this is strung on You? This is explained
in the next verse.</p>
