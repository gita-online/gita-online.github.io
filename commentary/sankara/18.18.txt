    <i>Jnanam</i>, knowledge (being derived in the sense of 'that through which something is known', jnana means 
    knowledge concerning all things in general): so also <i>jneyam</i>, the object of knowledge (that also is a 
    reference to all objects in general); similarly, <i>parijnata</i>, the knower, the experiencer, a product of 
    ignorance, who partakes of the nature of the limiting adjuncts; thus, this tripartite group formed by these 
    is the <i>trividha</i>, threefold; <i>karma codana</i>, inducement ot action, inducer of all actions in 
    general. For, it is when the three, viz knowledge etc., combine that commencement of all actions meant either 
    for acceptance or rejection are possible. After that, what are initiated by the five, viz locus etc., and are 
    grouped in three ways according to the differences of their being based on speech, mind and body become 
    comprehended under the three, viz instrument etc.

    This is what is being stated: <i>Karma-sangrahah</i>, the comprehension of actions; <i>iti</i>, comes under; 
    <i>trividhah</i>, three heads, three classes; viz karanam, the instrument (derived in the sense of that through 
    which anything is done), i.e. the external (organs) (ear etc.) and the internal (organs) (intellect etc.); 
    <i>karma</i>, the object (derivatively meaning that which is most cherished by the subject and is achieved .
    through an act); and <i>karta</i>, the subject (agent), who employs the instrument etc., who partakes of the 
    nature of the limiting adjuncts. Sangrahah is derived thus: that in which something is comprehended. The 
    comprehension of action (karma) is karma-sangrahah. Indeed, action becomes included in these three. 
    Hence is this 'threefold comprehension of action'. Now then, since action, instrument and result are all 
    constituted by the gunas, it becomes necessary to state the three fold variety in them based on the differences 
    among the gunas, viz sattva, rajas and tamas. Hence, the next verse begins.
