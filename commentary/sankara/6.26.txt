<p>In the beginning, the yogi who is thus engaged
in making the mind established in the Self, <i>etat
vasamnayet</i>, should bring this (mind) under the
subjugation; <i>atmani eva</i>, of the Self Itself; <i>niyamya</i>,
by restraining; <i>etat</i>, it; <i>tatah tatah</i>, from all those
causes whatever, viz sound etc.; <i>yatah yatah</i>, due
to which, due to whatever objects like sound etc.;
the <i>cancalam</i>, restless, very restless; and therefore
<i>asthiram</i>, unsteady; <i>manah</i>, mind; <i>niscarati</i>,
wanders away, goes out due to its inherent defects.
(It should be restrained) by ascertaining through
discrimination those causes to be mere
appearances, and with an attitude of detachment.
Thus, through the power of practice of Yoga, the
mind of the yogi merges in the Self Itself.</p>
