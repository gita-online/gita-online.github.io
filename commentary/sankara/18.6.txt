    <i>Tu</i>, but; <i>api</i>, even; <i>etani</i>, these; <i>karmani</i>, actions, viz sacrifice, 
    charity and austerity, which have been spoken of as purifiers; <i>kartavyani</i>, have to be 
    undertaken; <i>tyaktva</i>, by renouncing; <i>sangam</i>, attachment to them; and by giving up 
    (hankering for) their <i>phalani</i>, results.

    <i>Iti</i>, this; is <i>me</i>, My; <i>niscitam</i>, firm; and <i>uttamam</i>, best; <i>matam</i>, 
    conculsion. Having promised, 'hear from Me the firm conclusion regarding that (tyaga)' (4) and 
    also adduced the reason that they are purifiers, the utterance, 'Even these actions have 
    to be performed. This is the firm and best conclusion', is only by way of concluding the 
    promised subject matter; this sentence does not introduce a fresh topic. For it stands to reason 
    that the phrase 'even these' refers to some immediate topic under discussion. The implication of 
    the word api (even) is: 'Even these acts, which are causes of bondage to one who has attachment 
    and who hankers after their results, have to be undertaken by a seeker of Liberation.' But 
    the phrase 'even these' is not used in relation to other acts.

<p>
    <b>Others explain (thus)</b>: Since the nityakarmas have no results, therefore (in their case) it is 
    illogical to say, 'by giving up attachment and (hankering for their) results'. The meaning of 
    the phrase etani api (even these) is that, 'even these rites and duties, which are undertaken 
    for desired results and are different from the nityakarmas, have to be undertaken. What to speak 
    of the nityakarmas like sacrifice, charity and austerity!'
</p> 

<p>
    <b>Reply</b>: This is wrong since it has been established by the text, 'sacrifice, charity and 
    austerity are verily the purifiers,' that even the nityakarmas have results. For a seeker of 
    Liberation who wants to give up even the nityakarmas from fear of their being causes of bondage, 
    how can there be any association with actions done for desired results? Moreover, the phrase etani 
    api cannot apply to actions done for desired results (kamyakarmas), since they have been denigrated 
    in, '...indeed, actions is quite inferior' (2.49), and in, '...by actions other than that action 
    meant for God' (3.9), and since, on the strength of the texts, 'the Vedas have the three qualities 
    as their object' (2.45), 'Those who are versed in the Vedas, who are drinkers of Soma,...(pray for 
    the heavenly goal by worshipping) Me' (9.20), and 'they enter into the human world on the exhaustion 
    of their merit' (9.21), it has been definitely stated that actions done for desired results are 
    causes of bondage; and also because they are far removed from the context.
