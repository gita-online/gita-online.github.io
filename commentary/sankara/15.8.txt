    <i>Yat</i>, when; <i>isvarah</i>, the master of the aggregate of the body etc., the individual soul; <i>utkramati</i>, leaves the body, then he 
    draws. Thus, the second quarter of the verse is treated first for the sake of consistency. When the soul leaves the body, then it draws the 
    organs (see previous verses) from that body. In this way, the second quarter of the present verse is treated first, because going to another 
    body follows the leaving of the earlier one.

    <i>Ca api</i>, and even; <i>yat</i>, when; it <i>avapnoti</i>, assumes a body other than the earlier one; then, <i>grahitva</i>, taking; <i>etani</i>, 
    these, the organs with the mind as their sixth; <i>samyati</i>, he leaves, goes away totally. Like what? In reply the Lord says: <i>iva</i>, as; 
    <i>vayuh</i>, the wind (carries away); <i>gandhan</i>, odours; <i>asayat</i>, from their receptacles-flowers etc. Which, again, are those (organs)?
