<i>Aste</i>, he continues; <i>sukham</i>, happily; <i>sannyasya</i>, 
having given up; <i>sarva-karmani</i>, all actions - nitya, naimittika, 
kamya and nisiddha (prohibited actions); <i>manasa</i>, mentally, through 
discriminating wisdom i.e. having given up (all actions) by seeing inaction 
in action, etc. Freed from the activities of speech, mind and body, 
effortles, placid in mind, and devoid of all external wants which are 
different from the Self, he continues happily. This is what has been said.<br><br>

Where and how does the <i>vasi</i>, man of self-control, i.e. one who has 
his organs under control, remain?<br><br>

This is being answered: <i>Nava dvare pure</i>, in the town with nine gates, 
of which seven are in the head for one's own experiences, and two are below 
for urination and defecation. As possessed of those gates, it is called the 
'town with nine gates'. Being like a town, the body is called a town with 
the Self as its only master. And it is inhabited by the organs, mind, 
intellect and objects, like citizens, as it were, which serve its needs and 
which are productive of many results and experience. Renouncing all actions, 
the dehi, embodied one, resides in that town with nine gates.<br><br>

<b>Objection</b>: What is the need of this specification? For all embodied 
beings, be they monks or not, reside in bodies to be sure! That being so, 
the specification is needless.

<b>Vedantin</b>: The embodied one, however, who is unenlightened, who 
perceives merely the aggregate of the body and organs as the Self, he, in 
his totality, thinks, 'I am in a house, on the ground, or on the seat.' For 
one who experiences the body alone as the Self, there can certainly be no 
such conviction as, 'I am in the body, like one's being in a house.' But, 
for one who realizes the Self as distinct from the aggregate of body etc. 
it becomes reasonable to have the conviction, 'I am in the bdoy. It is 
reasonable that as a result of knowledge in the form of discriminating 
wisdom, there can be a mental renunciation of the actions of others, 
which have been ignorantly superimposed on the supreme Self. Even in the 
case of one in whom has arisen discriminating wisdom and who has renounced 
actions, there can be, like staying in a house, the continuance in the body 
itself-the town with nine gates-as a consequence of the persistence of the 
remnants of the results of past actions which have started bearing fruit, 
because the awareness of being distinct (from the body) arises while one 
is in the body itself.<br><br>

From the point of view of the difference between the convictions of the 
enlightened and the unenlightened persons, the qualifying words, 'He 
continues in the body itself', do have a purpose to serve. Although it has 
been stated that one continues (in the body) by relinquishing actions of 
the body and organs ignorantly superimposed on the Self, still there may be 
the apprehesion that direct or indirect agentship inheres in the Self.<br><br>

Anticipating this, the Lord says: <i>na eva kurvan</i>, without himself 
doing anything at all; and <i>na karayan</i>, not causing (others) to do, 
(not) inducing the body and organs to activity.<br><br>

<b>Objection</b>: Is it that the direct or indirect agentship of the 
embodied one inheres in the Self and ceases to be after renunciation, 
as the movement of a traveller ceases with the stoppage of his movement? 
Or, is it that they do not exist owing to the very nature of the Self? 

<b>Vedantin</b>: The Self by Its nature has neither direct nor indirect 
agentship. For it was stated, 'It is said that...This (Self) is unchangeable' 
(2.25). 'O son of Kunti, although existing in the body, It does not act, 
nor is It affected' (13.31). And it is also stated in the Upanisad, 
'It seems to meditate, as it were; It seems to move, as it were' 
(Br. 4.3.7).
