    <i>Dhyanena</i>, through meditation: Meditation means contemplation (on the Self) after withdrawing into the mind with 
    concentration the organs of hearing etc. from the objects like sound etc., and then withdrawing the mind into the 
    indwelling conscious Self. Thus, from the citation of such illustrations as, 'the crane meditates, as it were, 'the 
    earth meditates, as it were; the mountains meditate, as it were', it follows that meditation is a constant and 
    uninterrupted current of thought like a line of pouring oil. Through that meditation, <i>kecit</i>, some yogis; <i>pasyanti</i>, 
    realize; the indwelling conscious atmanam, Self; <i>atmani</i>, in (their) intellect; atmana, with the help of the internal 
    organ that has been purified by meditation. <i>Anye</i>, others; <i>sankhyena yogena</i>, through Sankhya-yoga: Sankhya 
    means thinking, 'These qualities, viz sattva, rajas and tamas, are objects of my perception; I am the Self, distinct from 
    them, a witness of their functions, eternal and different from the qualities.' This Sankhya is Yoga. Through that they 
    realize the Self with the help of the internal organ. This is how it is to be construed.

    And <i>anye</i>, others; <i>karma-yogena</i>, through Karma yoga-action itself being the Yoga: Action performed with 
    the idea of dedication to God is figuratively called Yoga since it leads to Yoga. (others realize) with the help of that 
    (action), through purification of the mind and rise of Knowledge.
