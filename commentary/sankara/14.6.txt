<i>Tatra</i>, among them, among sattva etc.;-the characteristics of sattva itself is being stated first sattva, <i>nirmalatvat</i>, being pure 
like a crystal stone;is prakasakam, an illuminator; and <i>anamayam</i>, harmless. <i>Anagha</i>, O sinless one; <i>badhnati</i>, it binds. How? 
<i>Sukhasangena</i>, through attachment to happiness. Bringing about theassociation of happiness, which is the object, with the Self, which 
is the subject, in the form of the idea, 'I am happy', is certainly an unreal contact with happiness. This as such is nescience, for the quality 
of an object cannot belong to a subject. And it has been said by the Lord that all the qualities, from 'desire' to 'fortitude' (see 13.6), 
are, indeed, of the field, which is the object. Therefore, it is certainly through nescience, which is an attribute of the Self and has the 
characteristics of non-discrimination between object and subject, that sattva apparently brings about the association with happiness, 
which is not the Self. It makes (the Self) attached, as it were; makes one not possessed of happiness as though possessed of it! 

Similarly, it binds also jnana sangena, through attachment to knowledge. Because of its concomitance with happiness, knowledge here is an 
attribute of the internal organ, the field, but not of the Self. Were it an attribute of the Self, there could be no contact (between it 
and the Self), and 'bondage' would become illogical. Association with knowledge etc. should be understood in the same sense as with happiness.
