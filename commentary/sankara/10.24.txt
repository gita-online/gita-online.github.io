O son of Prtha, <i>viddhi</i>, know; <i>mam</i>, Me; to be Brahaspati, <i>mukhyam</i>, the 
foremost; <i>purodhasam</i>, among the priests of kings. Being as he is the priest 
of Indra, he should be the foremost. <i>Senaninam</i>, among commaners of armies; 
I am Skanda, the commander of the armies of gods. <i>Sarasam</i>, among large 
expanses of water, among reservoirs dug by gods (i.e. among nature reservoirs); I am 
<p>sagarah</p>, the sea.
