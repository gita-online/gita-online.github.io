<i>Sarva-vrksanam</i>, among all trees, (I am) the <i>Asvatta</i>; and 
<i>Narada devarsinam</i>, among the divine sages - those who were gods and 
became sages by virtue of visualizing Vedic mantras; among them I am Narada. 
<i>Gandharvanam</i>, among the gandharvas, I am the gandharva called Citraratha. 
<i>Siddhanam</i>, among the perfected ones, among those who, from their very 
birth, were endowed with an abundance of the wealth of virtue, knowledge and 
renunciation; (I am) <i>munih</i>, the sage Kapila.
