<p><i>Bharatarsabha</i>, O best of the Bharata dynasty;
vaksyami, I shall speak; <i>tu</i>, now; <i>tam</i>, of that;
<i>kalam</i>, time; <i>prayatah</i>, by departing, by dying,
these words are to be which time; <i>yoginah</i>, the
yogis; <i>yanti</i>, attain; <i>anavrttim</i>, the State of Non-return,
of nonrebirth; <i>ca eva</i>, and also; <i>of the time
by departing at which they attain its opposite,
<i>avrttim</i>, the State of Return. By 'Yogis' are implied
both the yogis (men of meditation) and the men of
acitons (rites and duties). But the men of action are
yogis by courtesy, in accordance with the
description, 'through the Yoga of Action for the
yogis' (3.3). The Lord speaks of that time in the next
verse.</p>
