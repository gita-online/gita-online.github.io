And <i>aham</i>, I, as the Self; <i>san-nivistah</i>, am seated; <i>hrdi</i>, in the hearts, in the intellects; <i>sarvasya</i>, of all creatures. Therefore, 
with regard to all the creatures, <i>mattah</i>, from Me, from the Self; are <i>Smrtih</i>, memory; <i>jnanam</i>, knowledge; and their <i>apohanam</i>, loss. 
The knowledge and memory of these creatures who perform good deeds come from Me in accordance with the good deeds; similarly, the loss, deterioration, of 
memory and knowledge of those who perform evil deeds comes from Me in accordance with the evil deeds. 

<i>Aham eva</i>, I alone, the supreme Self; am the <i>vedyah</i>, object to be known; <i>sarvaih</i>, through all; <i>vedaih</i>, the Vedas. I am also the 
<i>vedanta-krt</i>, the originator of the Vedanta, i.e., the source of the traditional school of the teachings of Vedanta; and <i>aham eva</i>, I Myself; am the 
<i>veda-vit</i>, knower of the Vedas, the knower of the teachings of the Vedas. In the verses beginning with, 'That light in the sun which...' (12), etc. 
have been stated briefly the majesty of God, the Lord called Naravana, which arise from special limiting adjuncts. Now then, the succeeding verses 
are begun with a view to determining the real nature of that very Lord as the Unconditioned and Absolute, by distinguishing Him from the limiting adjuncts, 
(viz) the mutable and the immutable. In that connection, after dividing into three parts all the teachings of the preceding and the immediately succeeding chapters, 
the Lord says in the next verse.
