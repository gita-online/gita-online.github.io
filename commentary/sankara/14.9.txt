    O scion of the Bharata dynasty, <i>sattva</i>, sanjayati, attaches one; <i>sukhe</i>, to happiness; <i>rajas</i> (attaches is understood) 
    <i>karmani</i>, to action; <i>tu</i>, while; tamas, <i>avrtya</i>, covering up, veiling; <i>jnanam</i>, knowledge, the discrimination 
    produced by sattva; <i>sanjayati</i>, leads <i>pramade</i>, to inadvertence; <i>uta</i>, also. Pramada means non-performance of a duty on hand.
