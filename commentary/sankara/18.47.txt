    <i>Svadharmah</i>, one's own duty; though <i>vigunah</i>, defective-the word though has to be supplied; is 
    <i>sreyan</i>, superior to, more praiseworthy than; <i>paradharmat</i>, another's duty; <i>su-anusthitat</i>, 
    well performed. <i>Kurvan</i>, by performing; <i>karma</i>, a duty; <i>svabhavaniyatam</i>, as dictated by one's 
    own nature-this phrase means the same as svabhavajam (born from Nature) which has been stated earlier; 
    <i>na apnoti</i>, one does not incur; <i>kilbisam</i>, sin.

    As poison is not harmful to a worm born it it, so one does not incur sin by performing a duty dictated by one's 
    own nature. It has been siad that, as in the case of a worm born in poison, a person does not incur sin while 
    performing his duties which have been dictated by his own nature; and that someone else's duty is fraught with 
    fear; also that, one who does not have the knoweldge of the Self, (he) surely cannot remain even for a moment 
    without doing work (cf.3.5).
