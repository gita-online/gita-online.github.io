    <i>Asaktih</i>, non-attachment-attachment means merely the kind for things arising from association,
    the absence of that is asaktih; and <i>anabhisvangah</i>, absence of fondness-abhisvangah, is in fact 
    a special kind of attachment consisting of the idea of self-identification; as for instance, thinking 
    'I myself am happy,' or, 'I am sorrowful,' when somebody else is happy or unhappy, and thinking 
    'I live', or, 'I shall die,' when some- body else lives or dies - With regard to what?

    In answer the Lord says: <i>putra-dara-grhadisu</i>, with regard to sons, wives, homes, etc. From the 
    use of 'etc.' (it is understood that this fondness is) even with regard to others who are liked very 
    much-retinue of sevants and so on. And since both these (absence of attachment and fondness) lead to 
    Knowledge, therefore they are called Knowledge. And <i>nityam</i>, constant; <i>sama-cittatvam</i>, 
    equanimity of mind, mental equipoise; With regard to what? 
</p>

<p>
    In answer, the Lord says: <i>ista-anista upapattisu</i>, the attainment of the desirable and the 
    undesirable; mental equipoise with regard to them, always, without exception. One does not become 
    happy on the attainment of the desirable, nor does he become angry on the attainment of the undesirable. 
    And that constant equanimity of mind which is of this kind is Knowledge.
