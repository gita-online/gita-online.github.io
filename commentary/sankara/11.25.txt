<i>Drstva eva</i>, having merely seen; <i>te</i>, Your; <i>mukhani</i>, mouths; <i>damstra-karalani</i>, made 
terrible with (their) teeth; and <i>kala-anala-sannibhani</i>, resembling the fire of Dissolution is kalanala; 
similar to that; <i>na jane</i>, I have lost; the sense of <i>disah</i>, direction - I do not know the 
directions as to which is East or which is West; and hence, <i>na labhe</i>, find no; <i>sarma</i>, comfort. 
Therefore, <i>prasida</i>, be gracious; <i>devesa</i>, O Lord of gods; <i>jagannivasa</i>, O Abode of the 
Universe!
