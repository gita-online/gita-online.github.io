aggregate of creatures; <i>mohitam</i>, deluded as it is,
made to have indiscriminate perception; <i>ebhih</i>, by these;
aforesaid <i>tribhih</i>, three; <i>bhavaih</i>, things, in the
forms of attachment, repulsion, delusion, etc.; and
<i>gunamayaih</i>, made of the gunas, of the
transformations of the gunas; <i>na abhijanati</i>, does
not know; <i>mam</i>, Me; who am <i>param</i>, transcendental to,
distinct, different; <i>ebhyah</i>, from
these gunas as referred to above; and <i>am avyayam</i>,

do they cross over this divine Maya of Visnu,
constituted by the three gunas?</p>
