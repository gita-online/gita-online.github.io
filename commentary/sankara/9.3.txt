    <i>Parantapa</i>, O destroyer of foes; those <i>purusah</i>, persons, again; 
    who are <i>asraddadhanah</i>, regardless of, devoid of faith in; <i>asya dharmasya</i>, 
    this Dharma, this knowledge of the Self-those who are faithless as regards its 
    true nature as well as its result, who are sinful, who have taken recourse 
    to the 'upanisad' (mystical teaching) of demoniacal people, consisting in 
    consideration the body alone as the Self, and who delight in life (sense enjoyments); 
    <i>nivartante</i>, certainly go round and round; Where? <i>mrtyu-samsara-vartmani</i>, 
    along the path (vartma) of transmigration (samsara) fraught with death (mrtyu), the 
    path leading to hell, birth as low creatures, etc., i.e., they go round and round 
    along that very path; <i>aprapya</i>, without reaching; <i>mam</i>, Me, the supreme God.

    Certainly there is no question of their attaining Me. Hence, the implication is 
    that (they go round and round) without even acquiring a little devotion, which is 
    one of the disciplines constituting the path for reaching Me. Having drawn Arjuna's 
    attention through the (above) eulogy, the Lord says the next verse.
