<i>Ajnah</i>, one who is ignorant, who has not known the Self; and <i>asradda-dhanah</i>, who is faithless; and 
<i>samsaya atma</i>, who has a doubting mind; vinasyati, perishes. Although the ignorant and the faithless get ruined, 
yet it is not to the extent that a man with a doubting mind does. As for one with a doubting mind, he is the most 
vicious of them all.<br><br>

How?<br><br>

<i>Na ayam lokah</i>, neither this world which is familiar; <i>na</i>, nor also; <i>parah</i>, the next world; 
<i>na sukham</i>, nor happiness; <i>asti</i>, exist; <i>samsaya atmanah</i>, for one who has a doubting mind. 
For doubt is possible even with regard to them! Therefore one should not entertain doubt. Why? This is
explained in the next verse.
