<p><i>Sahasresu manusyanam</i>, among thousands,
among a multitude of men; <i>kascit</i>, a rare one;
<i>yatati</i>, endeavours; <i>siddhaye</i>, for perfection. <i>Siddhanam</i> 
<i>api</i>, even of the perfected one; <i>yatatam</i>, who are diligent -
they (those diligent ones themselves) being (considered
to be) verily perfect because they are striving for
Liberation; of them; <i>kascit</i>, one perchance, indeed;
<i>vetti</i>, knows; <i>mam</i>, Me; <i>tattvatah</i>, in truth.</p>

<p>Having drawn the attention of the hearer by arousing
interest, the Lord says the next verse.</p>
