    These <i>trividham</i>, threefold-of three kinds; <i>phalam</i>, results; <i>karmanah</i>, of actions 
    characterized as the righteous and the unrigtheous; <i>anistam</i>, the undesirable, consisting in 
    (birth in) hell, (among) animals, etc.; <i>istam</i>, the desirable, consisting in (birth as) 
    gods and others; and <i>misram</i>, the mixed, having a mixture of the desirable and the undesirable, 
    consisting in (birth as) human beings; these results that are of these kinds, <i>bhavati</i>, accrues; 
    <i>pretya</i>, after death, after the fall of the body; <i>atyaginam</i>, to those who do not resort to .
    renunciation, to the unilllumined, the men with rites and duties, who are not men of renunciation in the 
    truest sense.

    The derivative sense of the word phala (pha-la) is this: On accunt of being accomplished through the 
    operation of diverse external accessories, and a result of ignorance, comparable to the charm cast by 
    jugglery, a source of great delusion and appearing as though close to the indwelling Self, it is 
    phalgu (unsubstantial), and as a consequence it undergoes layam (disappearance). (The result that is 
    of this kind accrues to those who do not resort to renunciation).

    <i>Tu</i>, but; <i>na kvacit</i>, never; <i>sannyasinam</i>, to those who resort to monasticism for the 
    sake of the highest Reality, to the class of monks called paramahamsas who remain steadfast in Knowledge 
    alone. For, it cannot be that those who are devoted wholly to steadfastness in complete enlightenment 
    do not dig out the seed of transmigration. This is the meaning. Therefore it is only for those who have 
    realized the supreme Truth that it is possible to become a monk who renounces actions totally, 
    because action, accessories and results are superimmpositions on the Self through ignorance. 
    But the renunciation of all actions is not possible for an unenlightened person who perceives the 
    locus (the body etc.), action, agentship and accessories as the Self. This the Lord shows in the 
    following verses.
