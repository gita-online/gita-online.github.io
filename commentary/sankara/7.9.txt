<p>I am also the <i>punyah</i>, sweet; <i>gandhah</i>,
fragrance; <i>prthivyam</i>, in the earth. The earth is
dependent on Me who am its fragrance. The
natural sweetness of smell in the earth is cited by
way of suggesting sweetness of taste of water etc.
as well. But foulness of smell etc. is due to contact
with particular things, resulting from nescience,
unholiness, etc. of worldly people. <i>Ca</i>, and; <i>asmi</i>, I
am; the <i>tejah</i>, brilliance; <i>vibhavasau</i>, in fire; so also
(I am) the <i>jivanam</i>, life-that by which all creatures
live; <i>sarva-bhutesu</i>, in all beings. And I am the
<i>tapah</i>, austerity; <i>tapasvisu</i>, of ascetics. Ascetics are
established in Me who am that austerity.</p>
