    <i>Mama</i>, My own Maya, i.e. Prakrti consisting of the three qualities, which belongs to Me; is the <i>yonih</i>, womb for all the creatures. 
    ince it (Prakrti) is great (mahat) as compared with all its effects, and it is the sustainer (brahma) of all its own transformations, therefore 
    the womb itself is qualified as mahat brahma. <i>Tasmin</i>, in that, in the womb which is the great-sustainer; <i>aham</i>, I, God, possessed 
    of the power in the form of the two aspects, viz the field and the Knower of the field; <i>dadhami</i>, place, deposit; <i>garbham</i>, the 
    seed-the seed of the birth of Hiranayagarbha, te seed which is the cause of the birth of all things; i.e., I bring the field into association 
    with the Knower of the field who conforms to the nature of the limiting adjuncts, viz ignorance, desire and activity.

    <i>Tatah</i>, from that, from that deposition of the seed; O scion of the Bharata dynasty, <i>bhavati</i>, occurs; <i>sambhavah</i>, the birth, 
    origination; sarva bhutanam, of all things, following the birth of Hiranyagarbha.
