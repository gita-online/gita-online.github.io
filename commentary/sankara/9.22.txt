    On the other hand, <i>ye janah</i>, those persons, the monks, who are desireless 
    and fully illumined; who <i>ananyah</i>, becoming non-different (from Me), having 
    realized the supreme Deity, Narayana, as their own Self; and <i>cintayantah</i>, 
    becoming meditative; <i>paryu-pasate mam</i>, <i>tesam</i>, for them; who have 
    realized the supreme Truth, <i>nitya-abhiyuktanam</i>, who are ever attached (to Me);

    Yoga means making available what one does not have, and ksema means the protection 
    of what one has got. Since 'but the man of Knowledge is the very Self. (This is) 
    My opinion' and 'he too is dear to Me' (7.17,18), therefore they have become My 
    own Self as also dear. Does not the Lord surely arrange for securing what they 
    lack and protecting what they have even in the case of other devotees? This is true. 
    He does arrange for it. But the difference lies in this: Others who are devotees make 
    their own efforts as well for their own sake, to arrange for securing what they 
    lack and protecting what they have. On the contrary, those who have realized non-duality 
    do not make any effrot to arrange for themselves the acquisition of what they do 
    not have and the preservation of what they have. Indeed, they desire nothing for 
    themselves, in life or in death. They have taken refuge only in the Lord. 
    Therefore the Lord Himself arranges to procure what they do not have and protect 
    what they have got.

    'If you Yourself are the other gods even, then do not their devotees too worship You alone?' 
    'Quite so!'
