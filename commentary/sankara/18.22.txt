    But <i>tat</i>, that knowledge; is <i>udahrtam</i>, said to be; <i>tamasam</i>, born of tamas; <i>yat</i>, .
    which is; <i>saktam</i>, confined; <i>ekasmin</i>, to one; <i>karye</i>, from, to one body or to an external 
    image etc., krtsnavat, as though it were all, as though it comprehended everything, thinking, 'The Self, or 
    God, is only this much; there is nothing beyond it,' as the naked Jainas hold that the soul conforms to and 
    has the size of the body, or (as others hold) that God is merely a stone or wood, remaining confined thus to 
    one form; <i>ahaitukam</i>, which is irrational, bereft of logic; a <i>tattvarthavat</i>, not concerned with 
    truth <i>tattvartha</i>, truth, means some-thing just as it is; that (knowledge) which has this (truth) as its 
    object of comprehension is <i>tattvarthavat</i>; that without this is; and which, on account of the very fact 
    of its being irrational, is <i>alpam</i>, trivial, because it is concerned with trifles or is productive of 
    little result.

    This kind of knowledge is indeed found in non-discriminating creatures in whom tamas predominates. Now is 
    being stated the threefold division of action in the next verse.
