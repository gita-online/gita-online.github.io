    <i>Na suryah</i>, niether the sun-though possessed of the power of illumining everything; so also, <i>na sasankah</i>, nor the moon; 
    <i>na pavakah</i>, nor even fire; <i>bhasayate</i>, illumines; tat, That, that Abode which is of the nature of light. That abode, 
    the State of Visnu, <i>gatva</i>, reaching, attaining; <i>yat</i>, which; they <i>na</i>, do not; <i>nivartante</i>, return, and which 
    the sun etc. do not illumine; <i>tat</i>, that; is <i>mama</i>, My, Visnu's; <i>paramam</i>, supreme; <i>dhama</i>, Abode, State

    <b>Objection</b>: It has been said, 'reaching which they do not return'. Is it not well known that all goings end, verily, in returning, 
    and unions are followed by separations? How is it said that there is no return for those who come to that Abode?
