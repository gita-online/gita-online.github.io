<i>Api san ajah</i>, though I am birthless; and 
<i>avyayatma</i>, undecaying by nature, though I am 
naturally possessed of an undiminishing power of 
Knowledge; and so also api san, though; <i>isvarah</i>, 
the Lord, natural Ruler; <i>bhutanam</i>, of beings, from 
Brahma to a clump of grass; (still) <i>adhisthaya</i>, by 
subjugating; <i>svam</i>, My own; <i>prakrtim</i>, Prakrti, the 
Maya of Visnu consisting of the three gunas, under 
whose; spell the whole world exists, and deluded 
by which one does not know one's own Self, 
Vasudeva; by subjugating that Prakrti of Mine, 
<i>sambhavami</i>, I take birth, appear to become 
embodied, as though born; <i>atma-mayaya</i>, by 
means of My own Maya; but not in reality like an 
ordinary man. It is being stated when and why that 
birth occurs in the next verse.
