He, the Self-realized monk, <i>yah</i>, who; <i>asinah</i>, sitting; <i>udasinavat</i>, like one indifferent-as an indifferent man sides with 
nobody, similarly, this one, set on the path leading to the transcendence of the qualities; <i>na</i>, is not; <i>vicalyate</i>, distracted 
from the state of Knowledge arising out of discrimination; <i>gunaih</i>, by the qualities. This point is being clarified as such: <i>Yah</i>, 
he who; thinking <i>iti</i>, that; <i>gunah</i>, the qualities, which have trasnformed into body, organs and objects; <i>vartante</i>, act on one 
another; <i>avatisthati</i>, remains firm-avatisthati (instead of avatisthate) is used in the Parasmaipada to avoid a break in the metre, or 
there is different reading, 'yah anutisthati, who acts' - and an, does not; <i>ingate</i>, move; i.e., becomes <i>eva</i>, surely settled in .
his own nature.
