<p><i>Samyamya</i>, having controlled; <i>sarva-dvarani</i>,
all the passages, the doors of perception;
<i>niruddhya</i>, having confined; the <i>manah</i>, mind;
<i>hrdi</i>, in the heart—not allowing it to spread out; and
after that, with the help of the mind controlled
therein, rising up through the nerve running
upward from the heart, <i>adhaya</i>, having fixed;
<i>atmanah</i>, his own; <i>pranam</i>, vital force; <i>murdhni</i>, in
the lead; (and then) <i>asthitah</i>, continuing in;
<i>yogadharanam</i>, the firmness in yoga—in order to
make it steady.</p>
