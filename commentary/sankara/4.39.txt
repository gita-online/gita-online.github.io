<i>Sraddhavan</i>, the man who has faith; <i>labhate</i>, attains; <i>jnanam</i>, Knowledge. Even when one has faith, he may 
be indolent. Therefore the Lord says, tatparah, who is diligent, steadfast in the service of the teacher, etc., which are 
the means of attaining Knowledge. Even when one has faith and is diligent, one may not have control over the organs. 
Hence the Lord says, <i>samyata-indriyah</i>, who has control over the organs - he whose organs (indriyani) have been 
withdrawn (samyata) from objects. He who is such, who is full of faith, diligent, and has control over the organs, does 
surely attain Knowledge. However, prostrations etc., which are external, are not invariably fruitful, for there is scope 
for dissimulation faith etc. But this is not so in the case of one possessing faith etc.<br><br>

Hence they are the unfailing means of acquiring Knowledge. What, again, will result from gaining Knowledge?<br><br>

This is being answered: <i>Labdhva</i>, achieving; <i>jnanam</i>, Knowledge; <i>adhigacchati</i>, one attains; <i>acirena</i>, 
soon indeed; <i>param</i>, supreme; <i>santim</i>, Peace, supreme detachment called Liberation. That Liberation soon follows 
from full Knowledge is a fact well ascertained from all the scriptures and reasoning. One should not entertain any doubt in 
this matter. For doubt is the most vicious thing. Why? The answer is stated in the next verse.
