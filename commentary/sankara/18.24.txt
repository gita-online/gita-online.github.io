But <i>tat</i>, that; <i>karma</i>, action; <i>udahrtam</i>, is said to be; <i>rajasam</i>, born of rajas; 
<i>yat</i>, which; is <i>kriyate</i>, done; <i>kamepsuna</i> by one desirous of results; <i>va</i>, or; 
<i>saahankarena</i>, by one who is egotistic; and <i>bahulaayasam</i>, which is highly strenuous, accomplished 
by the agent with great effort. 'Egotistic' is not used in contrast to knowledge of Truth. 

What then? It is used in contrast to the absence of egotism in an ordinary person versed in the Vedic path. 
For in the case of the knower of the Self, who is not egotistic in the real sense, there is no question of 
his being desirous of results or of being an agent of actions requiring great effort. Even of actions born of 
sattva, the agent is one who has not realized the Self and is possessed of egoism; what to speak of actions 
born of rajas and tamas! In common parlance, a person versed in the Vedic path, even though not possessing .
knowledge of the Self, is spoken of as being free from egotism thus-'This Brahmana is free from egotism'. 
Therefore, 'sahan-karena va' is said in contrast to him only. Punah (again) is used to complete the meter.
