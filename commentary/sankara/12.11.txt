on doing works for Me'; in that case, <i>mad-yogam-asritah</i>, having resorted to the Yoga for Me - the performance of those works that are

renounce, give up, the results of all works; by becoming <i>yata-atmavan</i>, controlled in mind. Now the Lord praises the renunciation of the 
results of all works in the next verse.
