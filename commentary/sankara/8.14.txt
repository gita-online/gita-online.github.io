<p><i>Partha</i>, O son of Prtha, <i>tasya yoginah</i>, to that
yogi; <i>nitya-yuktasya</i>, of constant concentration,
who is ever absorbed (in God); and <i>ananya-cetah</i>,
of single-minded attention, a yogi whose mind is
not drawn to any other object; <i>yah</i>, who; <i>smarati</i>,
remembers; <i>mam</i>, Me, the supreme God; <i>satatam</i>,
uninterruptedly; and <i>nityasah</i>, for long. By
<i>satatam</i>, uninterruptedly, is meant 'without any
break'.</p>

<p>By <i>niryasah</i>, is meant along duration. Not
six months, nor even a year! What then? The
meaning is: He who remembers Me for his whole
life, continuously. To that yogi <i>aham</i>, I; <i>am
sulabhah</i>, easy of attainment. Since this is so,
therefore one should remain ever absorbed in Me,
with the mind given to nothing else. 'What follows
from Your being easy of attainment?' This is being
answered: 'Hear what follows from My being easy
of attainment.'</p>
