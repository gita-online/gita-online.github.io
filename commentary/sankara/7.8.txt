<p><i>Kaunteya</i>, O son of Kunti, <i>aham</i>, I; am <i>rasah</i>,
the taste, which is the essence of water. The idea is
that water is dependent on Me who am its essence.
This is how it is to be understood in every case.
Just as I am the essence of water, similarly, <i>asmi</i>, I
am; the <i>prabha</i>, effulgence; <i>sasi-suryayoh</i>, of the
moon and the sun; <i>pranavah</i>, (the letter) Om;
<i>sarva-vedesu</i>, in all the Vedas. All the Vedas are
established on Me who am that Om. So also (I am)
<i>sabdah</i>, the sound; <i>khe</i>, in space, as the essence.
Space is established on Me who am that (sound). In
the same way, <i>nrsu</i>, in men; (I am) <i>paurusam</i>,
manhood - the quality of being man, from which
arises the idea of manhood. Men are established on
Me who am such.</p>
