    <i>Na dvesti</i>, he neither dislikes these; <i>prakasam</i>, illumination (knowledge), an effect of sattva; <i>pravrttim</i>, activity, 
    an effect of rajas; and <i>moham</i>, delusion, an effect of tamas; <i>sampravrttani</i>, when they appear, when they fully emerge in the 
    form of objects (of experience), 'In me has arisen a perception which is a result of tamas; thereby I have become deluded'; so also, 
    'In me has risen (the inclination to) action which is painful and is born of rajas. By that rajas I have been actuated, carried away 
    from my own nature. This is a matter of sorrow to me that there has been a deviation from my own nature'; similarly, 'The quality of sattva, 
    in the form of illumination that is knowledge, binds me by attributing discrimination to me and making me attached to happiness'-(by thinking) 
    in these ways one dislikes them because of his being not fully enlightened. The person who has transcended the qualities does not dislike 
    them in this manner.

<p>
    Unlike a person having sattva etc., who longs for the effects of sattva etc. which withdraw themselves after becoming manifest to him, 
    the person who has gone beyond the qualities <i>na kanksati</i>, does not long for them in that way; <i>nivrttani</i>, when they disappear. 
    This is the idea. This is not an indication that can be perceived by others. What then? Since this characteristic is perceivable to oneself, 
    it is merely subjective. For dislike or longing, which is a subjective experience of a person, is not seen by another. Now, then, the Lord 
    gives the reply to the question, 'What is the behaviour of one who has gone beyond the qualities?' in the next verse.
