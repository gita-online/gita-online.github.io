Like a fool, <i>ajanata</i>, without knowing. Not knowing what? In answer he 
says: <i>idam</i>, this; <i>mahimanam</i>, greatness - the Cosmic form; <i>tava</i>, 
of Yours, of God; yat, whatever; uktam, was said; maya, by me (to You); 
<i>prasabham</i>, rashly, slightingly; <i>pramadat</i>, through inadvertence, 
being in a distracted state of mind; <i>va api</i>, or even; <i>pranayena</i>, 
out of intimacy - itimacy is the familiarity arising out of love; whatever I have 
said because of that reason; erroneously <i>matva</i>, thinking (You); <i>sakha iti</i>, 
to be a friend, of the same age; <i>iti</i>, addressing You as, 'O Krsna,' 
'O Yadava,' 'O friend,'. 

In the clause, 'tava idam mahimanam, ajanata, without knowing this greatness of 
Yours,' idam (this) (in the neutor gender) is connected with mahimanam (greatness) 
(in masculine gender) by a change of gender. If the reading be tava imam, then 
both the words would be in the same gender.
