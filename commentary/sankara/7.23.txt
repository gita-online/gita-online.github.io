<p>Since those non-discriminating men with
desires are engaged in disciplines for limited
results, therefore, <i>tat phalam</i>, that result; <i>tesam</i>, of
theirs; <i>alpamedhasam</i>, who are of poor intellect, of
poor wisdom; <i>antavat tu bhavati</i>, is limited,
ephemeral, indeed. <i>Devayajah</i>, the worshippers of
gods; <i>yanti</i>, go; <i>devan</i>, to the gods. <i>Madbhaktah</i>,
My devotees; <i>yanti</i>, to; <i>mam api</i>, to Me alone.</p>

<p>'Thus, though the effort needed is the same, they
do not resort to me alone for the unlimited result.
Alas! they are surely in a pitiable condition.' In this
manner the Lord expresses his compassion. 'Why
do they not take refuge in Me alone?' The answer
is in the next verse.</p>
