    <i>Ye</i>, those who, being devotees; <i>upasate</i>, meditate; mam, on Me, the supreme Lord of all the masters 
    of yoga, the Omniscient One whose vision is free from purblindness caused by such defects as attachment etc.; 
    <i>avesya</i>, by fixing, concentrating; their <i>manah</i>, minds; <i>mayi</i>, on Me, on God in His Cosmic 
    form; <i>nitya-yuktah</i>, with steadfast devotion, by being ever-dedicated in accordance with the idea 
    expressed in the last verse of the preceding chapter; and being <i>upetah</i>, endowed; <i>paraya</i>, with 
    supreme; <i>sraddhaya</i>, faith; <i>te</i>, they; <i>matah</i>, are considered; to be <i>yukta-tamah</i>, 
    most perfect yogis; <i>me</i>, according to Me, for they spend days and nights with their minds constantly 
    fixed on Me.

<p>
    Therefore, it is proper to say with regard to them that they are the best yogis. 'Is it that the others do 
    not become the best yogis?' No, but listen to what has to be said as regards them' (in the next verse).
