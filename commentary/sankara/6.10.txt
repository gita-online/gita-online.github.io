A yogi, a man of meditation; <i>satatam yunjita</i>, should constantly concentrate; <i>atmanam</i>, his mind; <i>sthitah</i>, by staying; <i>rahasi</i>, in a solitary place, in mountain caves, etc.; <i>ekaki</i>, alone, without any companion; <i>yata-citta-atma</i>, with mind and body controlled; <i>nirasih</i>, without expectations, free from hankering; and <i>aparigrahah</i>, free from acquisition. From the use of the qualifying words, 'in a solitary place' and 'alone,' it follows that (he has to undertake all these) after espousing monasticism. And even after renunciation, he should concentrate his mind by desisting from all acquisition. This is the meaning.
