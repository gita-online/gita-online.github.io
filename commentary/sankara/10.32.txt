    O Arjuna <i>sarganam</i>, of creations; I am the <i>adih</i>, beginning; <i>ca</i>, 
    and; <i>he antah</i>, end; <i>ca eva</i>, as also; the <i>madhyam</i>, middle - 
    I am the origin, continuance and dissolution. At the commencement (verse 20) 
    origin, end, etc. only of things possessed of souls were spoken of, but here 
    the mention is of all creations in general. 
</p>

<p>
    This is the difference. <i>Vidyanam</i>, among knowledges; I am the 
    <i>adhyatma-vidya</i>, knowledge of the Self, it being the foremost because 
    of its leading to liberation. <i>Pravadatam</i>, of those who debate; <i>aham</i>, 
    I; am <i>vadah</i>, Vada, which is preeminent since it is a means to determining 
    true purport. Hence I am that. 
</p>

<p>
    By the word pravadatam are here meant the different kinds of debate held by 
    debators, viz Vada, Jalpa, and Vitanda.
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Vada</b>: Discussion with open-mindedness, with a view to determining true purport.</li>

        <li>
            <b>Jalpa</b>: That mode of debate by which both parties establish their own viewpoint 
            through direct and indirect proofs, and refute the view of the opponent through 
            circumvention (Chala) and false generalization (Jati) and by pointing out 
            unfitness (of the opponent) to be argued with (Nigraha-sthana). 
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Vitanda</b>: One party establishes his viewpoint, and the other refutes it through 
            circumvention, false generalization and showing the unfitness of the opponent 
            to be argued with, without establishing his own views, that is termed. 
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Jalpa and Vitanda result only in a trial of strength between the opponents, 
    who are both desirous of victory, But the result of Vada is the ascertainment of 
    truth between the teacher and the disciple or between others, both unbiased.
