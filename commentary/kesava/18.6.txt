It might be submitted by an erudite enquirer that Lord Krishna  Himself  has
stated that <i>karma</i> or reactions to action leads to  the  bondage  of  <i>samsara</i>
the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death  so  can  how  can  actions  be
sanctifying  and  purifying.  To  answer  this  Lord  Krishna  assures  that
absolutely such prescribed Vedic activities such  as  <i>yagna</i>  or  ritualistic
propitiation and worship, <i>tapah</i> or austerities and <i>danam</i> or charity  to  the
Vaisnavas and Brahmins as well as daily obligatory duties must be  performed
with firm conviction and full faith in the  injunctions  and  ordinances  of
the Vedic scriptures; or else demerits, offenses and contamination  will  be
incurred. But although these activities are not to be  abdicated  they  must
be performed without any sense of ego as  the  doer  and  without  even  the
slightest desire for rewards. This can be accomplished either  as  a  matter
of duty or for the exclusive satisfaction of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or
any of His authorised incarnations  and  expansions  as  revealed  in  Vedic
scriptures.
