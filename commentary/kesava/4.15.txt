So Lord Krishna sums up His  conclusion  for  this  theme  by  stating  that
having known that He is completely free from desire and attachment  although
performing such magnificent activities like creation of all  the  worlds  He
is never implicated by it. But great beings like Manu and  Janaka  performed
actions according to the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and being  free
from egoism without desire for rewards also achieved <i>moksa</i> or liberation  as
such actions are never binding. Therefore  Arjuna  and  anyone  else  should
perform such actions following in their footsteps as  they  have  come  down
through the ages in parampara or diciplic succession.
