Now Lord Krishna explains that one digressing from <i>yoga</i> or  the  science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness  who  subsequently  takes  birth  in  a   humble   family   of
enlightened <i>Brahmins</i> may regain their previous spiritual  insight  early  on
in life. This is because by such a birth which they had acquired by dint  of
their spiritual insight from the previous birth,  the  everyday  environment
would be conducive to spiritual development  right  from  the  beginning  of
one's life. How could an aspirant to perfect <i>yoga</i> enhance their  development
which they had acquired being born in the  home  of  the  rich  and  wealthy
where one would be distracted by  abundant  pleasures  or  diverted  due  to
exorbitant  opulence?   The  words  <i>purvabhyasena</i>  means  by  the   prenatal
impressions from the previous life and by this  even  one  born  in  a  rich
family will feel drawn to  the  practice  of  <i>yoga</i>  and  seek  enlightenment
easily transcending the ordinances of the duties laid out in <i>karma  yoga</i>  or
prescribed Vedic activities for fruitive results. The understanding is  that
due to prenatal impressions one will be indifferent  to  performing  actions
and will strive by <i>jnana yoga</i> or cultivation of  Vedic  knowledge  for  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the soul.
