After presenting the  process  such  as  the  sitting  place  and  the  diet
required while practising <i>dhyana yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the  individual
consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness   by
meditation. Lord Krishna reveals the results of  such  endeavours  in  these
verses. He places emphasis on this superior  level  of  consciousness  where
the purified mind fully controlled by <i>yoga</i> becomes completely detached  from
worldly objectives and achieves <i>atma tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  soul.
From this point on the  <i>yogi</i>  becomes  perfected  in  <i>yoga</i>  and  experiences
transcendental bliss independent  of  all  contact  with  the  senses.  This
transcendental bliss is perceived  by  the  spiritual  intelligence  of  the
<i>atma</i> and the <i>yogi</i>  established  in  this  superior  level  of  consciousness
remains fixed in the <i>atma</i> never digressing from it even for a moment.   Lord
Krishna states the words <i>na eva calati</i> meaning one never deviates,  even  in
times  of  great  adversity.  This  is  because  the  transcendental   bliss
experienced emanates from within one's own inner self. How can  one  deviate
from themselves for after having become established  in  this  transcendence
one realises that the immortal <i>atma</i> is the only thing worthy  of  attainment
and that there is  nothing  greater  to  be  gained.  After  explaining  the
condition of steadiness and non-deviation in  general  terms.  Lord  Krishna
presents further in specific terms. That  superior  level  of  consciousness
which brings about a total state of  contentment  and  tranquillity  without
ever having even the slightest contact with sorrow and misery  is  known  as
<i>yoga.</i> The  word  <i>dukhena</i>  means  misery  and  includes  the  consequence  of
suffering which is induced as  a  result  of  the  senses  contacting  sense
objects  and  this  includes  pleasure  as  well.  This  superior  level  of
consciousness  should  be  resolutely  engaged  in  with  firm   faith   and
dedication  by  an  aspirant  seeking  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence. And if there appears to be a  delay  in  its  accomplishment  one
should not become distraught or disappointed as  by  perseverance  the  goal
will assuredly be attained. Disappointment is  the  impotent  propensity  to
doubt and lose faith for the success in one's  efforts  and  should  not  be
harboured.
