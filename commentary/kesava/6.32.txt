Now the question arises. What happens to  a  practitioner  of  <i>yoga</i>  or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness who becomes established  in   <i>yoga</i>  with  firm  faith
experiencing some realisations but later  in  life  due  to  negligence  and
lethargy in their practices fail to achieve perfection in <i>yoga</i>?  This  could
also be due to being unable to  control  the  mind  and  thus  incapable  of
controlling the senses  with  their  passions.  Such  an  aspirant  although
practising and endowed with faith does not have by the potency  to  maintain
the process and therefore the mind is diverted into pursuing the objects  of
the senses and thus deviated from <i>yoga</i> at the crucial time  of  death.  What
will such a persons destination be who like this fails to reach the goal  of
<i>moksa</i> or liberation after commencing the <i>yoga</i> in life. This is the  question
being beseeched for Lord Krishna to answer.
