The point may be brought  up  that  if  this  divine  and  sacred  spiritual
knowledge is so excellent and so easy to perform and is the  best  means  of
attaining the highest good; then why isn't everyone following this path  and
enthusiastically liberating themselves from the entrapment  of  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death?  Lord   Krishna   uses   the   word
<i>asraddadhanah</i> meaning absence of faith.  People  lacking  in  faith  due  to
having a mentality tainted by incessant performance  of  innumerable  sinful
activities are averted to  this  divine  spiritual  knowledge  magnanimously
bequeathed by Lord Krishna. Unable to receive such  divine  wisdom  and  the
inability to comprehend <i>bhakti</i> or pure loving  devotion  such  persons  feel
inferior subconsciously and  so  although  they  strive  for  liberation  by
diverse concocted and speculative methods they have no  success  because  of
lack of faith and aversion to Lord Krishna. Lacking in devotion and full  of
selfish motives and insatiable desires such persons revolve from  one  birth
to another again and again and again perpetually.
