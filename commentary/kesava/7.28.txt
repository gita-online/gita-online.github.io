The question may be raised that if embodied beings have been deluded from
time immemorial since conception in the gross body why is it that some
people are still seen exclusively worshipping the Supreme Lord? To this
Lord Krishna answers with the words punya-karmanam meaning performers of
virtuous deeds. Such persons having association of the Lord Krishna's pure
devotee and under His guidance are able to free themselves from all sins
and thus in the next life are born directly into a spiritual family by such
merits. The accumulated sins of previous lives which veil the light of
consciousness  have been dissolved and all erroneous knowledge along with
it, by performance of meritorious spiritual activities for many lifetimes.
All delusion in the form of reacting in attraction and aversion to the
dualities such happiness and distress, pleasure and pain, success and
failure, etc have been neutralised and hence one qualifies for knowledge of
the ultimate truth with firm resolve to worship the Supreme Lord Krishna,
the supreme controller, omnipotent and omniscient, the cause of all causes,
the ultimate bestower of all benedictions and just rewards for all actions
and who is an ocean of love for His devotees.
