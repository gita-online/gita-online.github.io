One should note that by  the  use  of  tvam  Lord  Krishna  is
asserting that Arjuna should be detached from his actions  and
perform his duty. Action is superior to  inaction  because  by
performing  actions  prescribed  in   the   Vedic   scriptures
according to  oneâs  occupation  and  stage  in  life  because
accumalated sins are destroyed that one has acquired  in  past
lives.  Realistically  not  performing  actions  is  also  not
practical because without actions one  is  not  able  even  to
maintain the physical body. The particle api  means  even  and
refers to what else more should be clarified.
