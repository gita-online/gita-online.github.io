Now Lord Krishna in order to clearly establish that  the  Supreme  state  of
highest devotion is  the  eternal  cause  of  internal  communion  with  the
Supreme Lord explains the process. The Supreme Lord specifically  emphasises
that only by exclusive loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord  is  highest
devotion of the Supreme state achieved.  This  is  the  paramount  goal  and
ultimate attainment  and  it  is  eternally  transcendent  and  infinite  in
nature. In the Bhagavat Purana, Canto 11, chapter  13,  verse  14  beginning
<i>etavan yoga adisto</i> is stated: The  yoga  system  taught  by  Lord  Krishna's
devotees such as the Kumaras is withdrawing the mind from  external  objects
and focusing it on the Supreme Lord. In the Visnu Purana the Prince  Prahlad
exclaims  to  the  <i>avatar</i>  or  incarnation  of   Lord   Krishna   known   as
Narasinghadeva that: Just as the beloved has ardent love for the lover  such
is the depth of love that he wishes to have in his  heart  for  the  Supreme
Lord.
