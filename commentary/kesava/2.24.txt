In this verse Lord Krishna  states the reasons why the  soul  can  never  be
destroyed  and  these  three  descriptions   are   because   the   soul   is
incombustible, insoluble and unwitherable. Why is this so? Because the  soul
is nitya or eternal. Only  the  transitory  physical  body  can  be  burned,
moistened or withered. The soul is extremely  subtle,  subatomic  in  nature
and sarva-gatah meaning all pervading.  Being  all  pervasive  the  soul  is
extremely supra-subtle, more so than air  or  even  than  atoms.  Being  the
subtlest of the subtlest it is sthanuh or unchangeable as  it  is  incapable
of being modified in any way. As it is acalah or permanent it is  devoid  of
any nature of change and constant and as it is constant it is  sananatah  or
everlasting and eternally existing.
