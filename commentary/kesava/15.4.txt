<p><div align=justify>Anticipating that a spiritually intelligent  aspirant  would  wish  to  know
what type of <i>jivas</i> or  embodied  beings  are  able  to  attain  the  eternal
spiritual worlds, Lord Krishna reveals that one who is free from  pride  and
infatuation, who is undeluded  by  material  nature  due  to  discriminative
knowledge of the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul and the physical body,  understanding
that they are distinctly different. Who have conquered  the  tenacious  vice
of attachment. Who have overcome feelings of  passion  and  repugnance.  Who
are free from false ego imagining they are the physical body. Whose  mundane
cravings and worldy desires have altogether ceased to  exist  and  who  have
surpassed the dualities of material existence such  as  pleasure  and  pain,
happiness and unhappines, cold and hot  attraction  and  aversion.  Who  are
situated in <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the  soul  and  are  in  perpetual
communion with the <i>atma.</i> Those possessing all these attributes  achieve  the
imperishable Supreme state for they perceive the the actual  nature  of  the
<i>atma</i> and receiving unveiled knowledge direct from within they  are  able  to
attain the Supreme Lord Krishna eternally.
