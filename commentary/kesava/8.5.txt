<p><div align=justify>Now Lord Krishna answers the seventh  question  with  the  words  <i>anta  kale</i>
meaning at the time of death, one who  leaves  their  body  <i>mam  eva  smaran</i>
meaning remembering Him exclusively, He who is the presiding diety over  all
dieties, the granter of all wishes and the fulfiller of all desires  attains
his state of <i>sat-chi-ananda</i> or eternal existence,  transcendental  knowledge
and unending bliss. This verse confirms and  explains  in  what  manner  the
Supreme Lord Krishna is to be known at the moment of death.
