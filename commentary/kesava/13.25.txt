Thus by irrefutably establishing the fact of the <i>atma</i> or  immortal  soul  as
existing equally within the etheric heart of each and  every  living  entity
and the reality that <i>paramatma</i> or  the  Supreme  Soul  is  residing  equally
within the  etheric  heart  of  all  living  entities  simultaneously;  Lord
Krishna categorically refuted any and all conceptions that different  shapes
and forms of the physical body was relevant to this. Now  He  confirms  that
<i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum  pervading  physical  existence  is  the
source of all  variegated species and forms of the physical  bodies  of  the
<i>jivas</i> or embodied beings. When one can see and understand that all <i>jivas</i>  in
material existence are in possession of the <i>atma</i> whether they are  demigods,
human or animal, etc. and are all rooted in the same  absolute  reality  and
appear  only  as  different  manifestations  of  the  same  absolute  nature
expanded at the commencement of creation. At that very moment  one  achieves
infinite  knowledge  and  realisation  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  the   spiritual
substratum pervading all existence.
