As the Kaurava army  became  fearful,  to  the  contrary  the  Pandava  army
remained fearless and their boldness increased. This is shown by  mentioning
Arjunas flag which displays as its emblem that  fearless  hero  Hanuman  who
diminishes the courage of the enemy.  At the moment, at the  very  brink  of
battle when the clash of weapons was almost about to start, Arjuna  held  up
his invincible bow named  Gandiva  which was  given  to  him  by  Agni,  the
demigod  of fire and calmly  looked  upon  the  well  arrayed  army  of  the
Kauravas before him  and  spoke  to  the  Lord  Krishna  addressing  Him  as
<i>Hrsikesa</i> the master of the senses. The use of  the  vocative  epithet  <i>mahi-</i>
<i>pati</i> meaning O lord of the earth in reference to  Dhritarastra  is  sardonic
indicating that his very ruler ship of the earth will be terminated  due  to
a lack of righteousness.
