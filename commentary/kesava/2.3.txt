By addressing Arjuna as the son of Prtha it refers to his mother  Kunti  who
by worshipping Indra, the ruler of the demi-gods received Arjuna as her  son
endowed with extraordinary might and valor like Indra. Lord Krishna  reminds
Arjuna of this to instruct him not to yield to this impotence  for  it  does
not befit him and that he should discard this weakness of  heart.  By  using
the  vocative  parantapa  meaning  chastiser  of  enemies  Lord  Krishna  is
reminding Arjuna that at the time of his birth a heavenly  voice  proclaimed
that he would conquer all enemies.
