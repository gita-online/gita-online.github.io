Having described the three types of  action  dependent  upon  the  knowledge
possessed by the performer in each of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes  of  material
nature.  Lord  Krishna  now  presents  the  actions  of   prescribed   Vedic
activities beginning with <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of  goodness.  Those  actions
that are ordained by the Vedic scriptures as obligatory, that are  performed
as a matter of duty without attachment, that are executed  without an  egoic
sense of being the doer, that are performed without desire  for  rewards  in
the form of name, fame, wealth, honor, adoration, etc.
Such actions are deemed by the wise as being situated in <i>sattva guna.</i>
