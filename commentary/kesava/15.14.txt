The Supreme Lord  Krishna  affirmed  that  sun,  the  moon  and  fire  which
accomplish universal well being are His divine <i>vibhutis</i> or  opulences  .  He
previously revealed that the entire creation comprised of the  sentient  and
non-sentient  are  fully  dependent  upon  Him;   yet   He   is   completely
independent. He inspires cosmic intelligence, He is  worth  knowing  through
the Vedas and is the precceptor of all as He is situated equally within  the
etheric heart of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings from Brahma the  most  evolved
sentient being to the least evolved  sentient being. He is the witness,  the
monitor and inner controller of every <i>jiva.</i>  Memory  of  things  experienced
and true knowledge arising from accurate  perception  of  contact  with  the
senses comes from Him as well  as  the  rationalisation  faculty  of  faulty
knowledge and loss of memory and knowledges also flow from Him. The  Supreme
Lord Krihsna is  paramount  to  all  and  thus  essential  to  know  because
everything manifests from Him and because He manifests  Himself  within  all
etheric hearts as the immortal part of  every  <i>jiva.</i>   All  the  33  million
demigods who  supervise  universal  management  in  trillions  of  unlimited
universes throughout all material creation are expansions  of  His  <i>vibhutis</i>
and dependent solely upon Him such as Vayu the wind god,  Agni  the  god  of
fire, Surya the sun god, etc. The  Mahabharata  confirms  some  worship  the
Supreme Lord as the sun, the moon, the wind,  fire,  the  life  breath,  the
infinite,  the  absolute.  All  the  luminaries  of  the  worlds,  all   the
sovereigns  of  creation,  the  three  sacrificial  fires,  the  five  daily
austerities, all are verily the Supreme  Lord  Krishna.  But  this  material
creation comprises only one fourth or 25 percent of His  unlimited  potency.
The remaining three quarters or 75 percent compries  the  eternal  unlimited
spiritual worlds. We offer praises to Him, the  eternal  repository  of  all
praises. The Vedas glorify Lord Krishna. Propitiations of  ghee  and  grains
are offerred by the Vaisnavas and Brahmins to  Him  sanctifying  the  sacred
fire. Throughout the Vedas, the Puranas, the Ramayana and  the  Mahabharata;
Lord Krishna is glorified in the beginning, the  middle  and  the  end.  The
Katha Upanisad  I.II.XV beginning <i>sarve veda yat padamamanvati</i>  states:  The
Supreme Lord is whom all the Vedas declare and for whom all austerities  are
performed. His personal sound vibration is OM, the  all  encompassing  sound
frequency of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

The Supreme Lord Krishna  is  the  absolute  authority  on  the  Vedas,  the
deciding authority on the contrary statements of the Vedas when they  appear
contradictory  to  each  other  due  to  varying  angles  of  vision   while
expounding on various, diverse topics. He is  the  eternal,  universal  guru
and the propounder of  the  philosophy  of  the  Vedic  scriptures.  As  the
originator of the Vedic scriptures He has  imbued  them  with  the  ultimate
import and no one can  fathom  this  and  know  the  meaning  of  the  Vedic
scriptures without His grace. One becomes a knower of the  Vedic  scriptures
when through the grace of Lord Krishna one realises  the  reality  that  the
Vedic scriptures originated from Him to guide and protect those in  material
creation to return to Him. Those who who are not graced by the Supreme  Lord
can never fathom and discover the import of the  Vedic  scriptures  even  if
they are  reknowned  scholars  and  erudite  professors  who  give  detailed
discourses on them. This is because they are not  devotees  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna.  Lord  Krishna  is  the  absolute,  original  establisher  and
ultimate authority on the Vedas and there  are  none  qualified  to  expound
upon any aspect of the Vedic scriptures contrary  to  that  which  has  been
directly  revealed, declared and instructed by Him, His authorised  <i>avataras</i>
or incarnations and expansions as confirmed in Vedic scriptures and  by  His
devotees in authorised disciplic succession who have received His grace.  An
example of this is the devotee Prahlad receiving the grace of  Lord  Krishna
through His <i>avatara</i> known as Narasinghadeva who  rescued  His  devotee  from
death nine times.
