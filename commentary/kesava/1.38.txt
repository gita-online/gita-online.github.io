It may be put forth that although Arjuna disregarding ksatriya ethics  might
refrain from battle out of deluded compassion for friends and  kinsman;  but
as far as the enemy is concerned  they  will  not  refrain  themselves  from
battle; but are determined to fight  for  dominion  of  the  kingdom.  Being
fully intent on victory the sons of Dhritarastra may slay you  even  if  you
do not fight. Then what is the use  of  not  fighting?  In  answer  to  this
Arjuna states that even if the sons of Dhritarastra being devoid  of  wisdom
and obsessed by greed would slay him unarmed  and  unresisting,  this  would
still be more preferable  than  perpetuating  sin  by  slaying  friends  and
kinsman  and  permanently  going  to  hell  as  a  result.  What  Arjuna  is
practically saying is that if he refrains from fighting then at  the  deaths
of his physical body there would be no feelings of guilt or repentance  from
committing such a sin.
