It has been established that <i>bhakti</i>  or  loving  devotion  to  Lord  Krishna
exclusively purifies a devotee of the  blemish  of  heinous  and  abominable
practices due to unrighteous character and habits and that <i>bhakti</i>  alone  is
capable of leading such a one directly to the  supreme  destination  of  the
spiritual worlds and  into  Supreme  Lords  eternal  association.  Now  Lord
Krishna enumerates on this supreme  destination  even  being  accessible  to
those who are unworthy due to circumstances of birth.  This  includes  those
of vile birth such as  untouchables,  <i>mleechas</i>  or  meateaters,  those  born
illegitimately, those without education, <i>vaisyas</i>  or  the  mercantile  class
which is situated below women and above <i>sudras</i> which is  the  menial  class.
All these lack the qualification for Vedic knowledge and thus  destitute  of
righteous conduct  are  only  eligible  to  exist  on  the  lowest  path  of
existence; but if they somehow or other receive the mercy of  a  devotee  of
Lord Krishna. By this mercy taking sole refuge  in  the  Supreme  Lord  then
they also will verily reach the Supreme destination as well.
