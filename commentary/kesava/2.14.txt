Although  the  delusion  of  death  is   not   appropriate   regarding   the
misconception of the souls destruction  when  it  is  in  fact  eternal  and
immortal; still it could be submitted that loss of  life   would  result  in
great unhappiness when  preceptors,  friends  and  relatives  are  slain  in
battle departing their physical bodies and from this the delusion that  they
are dead may arise. To dispel this doubt Lord Krishna replies: that  sensory
perception or the contact between the senses and their objects give rise  to
feelings of heat and cold, pleasure and pain. If they  are  soft  and  sweet
they are pleasing but if they are bitter  and  harsh  they  are  unpleasant.
These things are all temporary, they are not eternal like the soul;  but  of
a fleeting impermanent nature which comes and  goes.  Therefore  one  should
just tolerate them with discrimination,  patience  and  fortitude  for  they
will  disappear  in  due  course  of   time.   By   addressing   Arjuna   as
Bharata signifies the great heritage in his ancestry on  his  fathers  side.
To address him as Kaunteya  signifies the great heritage in his ancestry  on
his mothers side. This suggests that such delusion  is  quite  improper  for
Arjuna.
