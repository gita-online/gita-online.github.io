O' <i>Purusottama</i> meaning the Supreme personality  is  being  used  to  address
Lord Krishna in the vocative case and is being elaborated  further  by  four
additional epithets describing His ultimate position as  progenitor  of  all
beings, Lord of all beings, Lord of lords  and  Lord  of  the  universe.  In

power of His Self and none else.
