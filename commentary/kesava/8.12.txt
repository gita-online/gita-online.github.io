Lord Krishna describes the method  in  brief  with  details  with  the  word
<i>samyamya</i>  meaning  restrained.  Having  restrained   all   the   senses   by
withdrawing them from their respective objects, all the doors  of  the  body
such as the eyes, ears, etc.,  along  with  the  cessation  of  all  worldly
considerations, fixing the mind in the heart and directing the  life  breath
to the <i>ajna cakra</i> between the eyebrows one so becomes  established  in  <i>yoga</i>
or the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion with  the
ultimate consciousness.
