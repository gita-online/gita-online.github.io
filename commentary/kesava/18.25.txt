Of the three objects worth knowing Lord Krishna speaks of the  performer  of
actions in the three <i>gunas</i> or  modes  of  material  nature  commencing  with
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness. One  who  is  free  from  the  desire  for
rewards of actions is free from  attachment  to  actions.  Such  a  one  has
dissolved  their  ego  involving  the  performance  of   actions.   Although
possessing  enthusiasm  and  determination  they  are  equipoised  and   not
agitated by the infamy of failure or ecstatic by the adulation  of  success.
Those possessing such attributes are invariably situated in <i>sattva guna.</i>
