If one were to enquire further that after achieving indifference to  worldly
topics by performing selfless activities free from desire for  reward,  will
equanimity manifest. Lord Krishna states that when our minds caught  between
the dichotomy of dualities due to hearing throughout our  lives  conflicting
conclusions and adhering to false conceptions, with little or  no  knowledge
of the ultimate truth and becomes steadfast. Then unshakeable and  fixed  in
the flow of all mental aspirations culminating in an unending focus  of  the
soul, perceiving no other goal.  One will immediately be  in  the  state  of
equanimity as the fruit of equanimity is the gradual experience of the  soul
itself.
