The  righteous  and  virtuous  worship  the  Supreme  Lord  with  faith  and
devotion. What Lord Krishna is saying is that four types of virtuous  humans
who have accumulated merit from righteous deeds from previous lives  worship
Him according to the gradation of the merits.
<p>
<i>1) artto</i> are those afflicted by problems such as disease or enemies. If  one
has enough accumulated merit then  they  will  have  the  opportunity  to
worship the Supreme Lord to alleviate their distress.  Examples  of  this
from Vedic scriptures were the  many  pious  kings   imprisoned  by  King
Jarasandha who prayed to the  Supreme  Lord  to  be  delivered  and  Lord
Krishna rescued them. Also Queen Draupadi  prayed  to  Lord  Krishna  for
succour when she was being disrobed at the Kaurava  assembly  hall  under
the insistence of Duryodhana and Lord Krishna protected  her  honor.  The
elephant king Gajendra was seized by a terrible crocodile and just before
succumbing he prayed to the Supreme Lord for aid and was saved  and  last
but not least when Shiva gave the head exploding benediction to the demon
Vkra who immediately began pursuing  him  to  test  it  then  Shiva  took
shelter of Lord Krishna who terminated the demons  life.  All  these  are
examples of those whose previous merit qualified  them  to  pray  to  the
Supreme Lord. Otherwise not having sufficient merit they  would  only  be
able to pray to Rudra or Ganesh or Kali or even some impersonal  phantasm
god.
<i>2) jijnasur</i> or liberation seekers like Videha, Mucukunda and King Yadu  also
had enough acquired merit from prvious lives to qualify  for  worship  of
the Supreme Lord.
<i>3) artharthi</i> or the seekers of wealth who desire to  regain  the  rulership,
position of power and enjoyments from which they had  before  and  became
deprived. Examples of these from Vedic scriptures are Dhruva, Sugriva and
Vibhisana. The worship of these three is tinged with selfish  motivations
but as soon as  their  wishes  were  fulfilled  they  achieved  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberatiion from material existence and overcame the cycle of  birth  and
death.
<i>4) jnani's</i> or those of spiritual wisdom who  have  no  selfish  motives  are
endowed with discriminative intelligence from ascertaining the reality of
the <i>atma</i> or soul and its  relationship  as  an  eternal  portion  of  the
Supreme Lord. They also achieve <i>moksa</i> but they continue on to worship the
Supreme Lord joining Him in His eternal pastimes. Great  beings  of  this
calibre are the Kumaras, Narada Muni, Sukadeva, Bhishma and Uddhava.
