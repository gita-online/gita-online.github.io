Lord Krishna extolling the virtues of the  process  of  spiritual  knowledge
concludes chapter  two  with  this  verse  enunciating  the  performance  of
actions by being unattached to their rewards. This  state  of  consciousness
leads to self-realisation and brahmi the  ultimate  truth.  Having  achieved
this  one  never  again  deluded  by  the  material  energy.  Nor  does  one
experience the feeling of I or mine in relationship with the physical  body.
Even if one becomes established in this state at the last moment when  death
has  come  still  one  will  achieve  the  eternal   spiritual   attainment.
Liberation from the material existence in the form of ecstatic  bliss  which
is completely devoid of all unhappiness because it is derived  as  a  result
of the cessation of all desires for reward  for  ones  actions.  In  essence
this means that having relinquished both the physical body  and  the  subtle
body one becomes qualified to realise their spiritual  body  and  experience
the sublime bliss of uninterrupted devotion to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
What more to say to one who began this process and experienced bliss in  the
early stages of their life, they will attain the eternal spiritual realm  at
their lifes end.  So the following eternal truths must be stated.
<p>
1) The root cause of attaining God realisation is  certainly  pure  devotion
unto God, whereas self-realisation or soul-cognition  although  extremely
exalted is secondary, devotion to GOD is primary being  the means as well
as the goal to be attained.
<p>
2)  Through  the  process  of  devotion  one  becomes  relieved   from   all
unhappiness due to being free from attachment  and  possessing  spiritual
intelligence  is  completely   equipoised  in   transcendent   meditation
attaining the bliss of supreme peace.
<p>
3) This commentary of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita: chapter two has been  delineated
to accomplish the highest good for the devotees and the  benefit  of  the
spiritually intelligent by the mercy and grace of Lord Krishna.
<p>
Thus ends the Kumara Vaisnava Sampradaya commentary entitled Tattva-
Prakasika to Srimad Bhagavad-Gita: chapter 2 by Keshava Kashmiri.
