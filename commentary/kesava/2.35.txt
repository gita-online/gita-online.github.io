Lord Krishna speaks this verse in the event that Arjuna might  still  insist
in giving the reason for not fighting as compassion  for  relatives  and  as
such he would rationalise that there is no  censure  or  infamy.  If  Arjuna
were to refrain from fighting  the  Kauravas,  who  everyone  present  knows
tried to kill the five Pandavas in various ways like by poison and  by  fire
and then unsuccessful in their attempts tried to  steal  their  kingdom  and
put them in exile to the forest for 13 years, the same Arjuna  who  went  to
the  heavenly  planets  and  exhibited  extraordinary  prowess  and   valour
pleasing his father Indra, king of  the  celestials.  The  same  Arjuna  who
Arjuna who pleasing Mahadeva Shiva received his mercy and a boon  from  him.
The same Arjuna whose weapons are more powerful  than  Bhishmas  which  were
invincible against avatar Parasurama. The same Arjuna who arriving  on  this
present battlefield made  the oath "I will defeat all my enemies!" The  same
Arjuna who so famous for his innumerable exploits, various weapons,  valour,
spirit and excellence, whom all the mighty warriors  on  the  opposing  side
are extremely joyous and eager to fight with. The same warriors  who  Arjuna
has instructed Lord Krishna to place his mighty chariot in front of  between
the two armies and now is stationed by Lord  Krishna  for  all  to  witness.
Arjuna would  belittle himself in front of all the  mighty  warriors  headed
by Bhishma, Drona and Karna if with his weapons dropped  and  eyes  full  of
tears he was to leave the battlefield exhibiting grief and all the  warriors
on both sides would think he left the war out of fear.  Where  there  is  no
fear a ksatriya never refuses to engage in battle.
