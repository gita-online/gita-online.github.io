In  this  manner  Lord  Krishna  describes  the   characteristics   of   one
established  in  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the  individual   consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness. Now He gives  a  simile
comparing an unwavering flame in a windless place with the mind  of  a  <i>yogi</i>
rapt in concentrated mediatation on the <i>atma</i> or soul. The purport  is  as  a
candle flame is sheltered from the wind, the mind of a  <i>yogi</i>  shines  bright
by the unflickering effulgence of the <i>atma.</i>
