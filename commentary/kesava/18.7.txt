The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  delineates  the  three  types  of  renunciation
associated with prescribed Vedic activities. Prohibited actions and acts  of
<i>adharma</i> or unrighteousness as well as any activity  motivated  by  a  desire
other then the satisfaction of  the  Supreme  Lord  are  undoubtedly  to  be
abandoned.  But renunciation of prescribed Vedic activities results in  evil
and inauspiciousness acts  that  propel  one  to  hellish  destinations.  An
example is not following <i>ekadasi</i> or fasting from all grains on the 11th  day
of the waxing and waning new moon and  full  moon.  If  one  renounces  this
injunction one will certainly have to  suffer  in  a  hellish  condition  of
life. So  to  disregard  and  ignore  prescribed  Vedic  activities  is  not
appropriate or advisable because these activities help to purify  the  mind.
To relinquish  what  is  benefical  due  to  indifference,  indiscretion  or
indiscrimination has been declared as situated  in  <i>tama  guna</i>  or  mode  of
ignorance because such renunciation reveals  the  presence  of  inertia  and
nescience.
