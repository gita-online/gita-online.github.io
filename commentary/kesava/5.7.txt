If it is postulated that the <i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all
existence is omnipresent and transcendental to <i>prakriti</i> or  material  nature
then how is it that a person engaged in actions  within  <i>prakriti</i>  possesses
the same  attributes?  To  answer  this  Lord  Krishna  affirms  that  those
practising <i>yoga</i> or the science of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion with the ultimate consciousness while  being  engaged  in  actions
with a pure mind, controlled senses and body and realising that the <i>atma</i>  or
soul exists equally within all beings is the  well  wisher  of  all  beings,
such a <i>yogi</i> having overcome the duality  of  activity  and  inertia  is  not
bound by actions. The word <i>yoga</i> specifically establishes that such a  person
is a <i>yogi</i> and achieving purity treats all beings equally  and  thus  becomes
transcendental to <i>prakriti</i>  and equal to  the  <i>Brahman</i>  in  its  attributes.
Having attained the <i>Brahman,</i> fully peaceful in  mind,  neither  grieving  or
desiring equiposed in all situations and to all beings such  a  one  obtains
devotion to the Supreme.  Thus the explanation given is quite appropriate.
