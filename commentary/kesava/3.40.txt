By revealing the locations where kama or lust covertly resides
Lord Krishna indicates that there is a method  of  controlling
it. The senses infatuate the mind,  the  mind  infatuates  the
intellect and  the  intellect  enveloped  by  kama  loses  all
discriminatory  powers  and  succumbs  to  the  pursuance   of
gratifying oneâs senses in sensual pleasures. This infatuation
reverses the delight in cultivation  of  Vedic  knowledge  and
causes a person to chase the delights  of  sense  objects  and
strives mightily to satisfy every one of them.
