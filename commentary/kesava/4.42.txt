The sword of spiritual knowledge is the eternal  <i>atma</i>  or  soul.  All  doubt
should be completely uprooted from one's heart and mind and follow the  path
that Lord Krishna has so concisely explained which is first and foremost  to
do one's duty in life according to qualification. Following  this  path  one
will acquire the spiritual knowledge to cross  over  <i>samsara</i>  the  cycle  of
birth and death and attain <i>moksa</i> liberation from material existence..
