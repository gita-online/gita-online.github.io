<p><div align=justify>The question may  arise  that  since  the  votaries  of  the  demigods  fall
continuously back into <i>samsara</i> the cycle of birth and  death  then  why  did
Lord Krishna advocate the worship of the demigods as He did  in  earlier  in
chapter 3, verses 10 and 11. In this regard  it  should  be  clarified  that
Lord Krishna did not state that worship of the demigods has no value at  all
but that worship of the demigods has no  permanent  value  as  the  demigods
themselves are not eternal. But it should be understood  that  one  receives
the merit and reward in accordance  to  what  their  object  of  worship  is
qualified to bestow. The adorers and worshippers of the Supreme Lord have  a
preponderance of <i>sattva guna</i> the  mode  of  goodness.  The  propitiators  of
ceremonies for the ancestors have a preponderance of <i>raja guna</i> or  the  mode
of passion and the ritualistic panderers of the demons, ghosts  and  spirits
have a preponderance of <i>tama guna</i> or  the  mode  of  ignorance.  All  these
worshippers if successful in their  propitiation  are  bequeathed  with  the
rewards sought after by their respective object of worship  achieving  their
realm, in close proximity and association sharing all the  delights  offered
there until one  has  exhausted  their  merit  where  they  fall  back  into
<i>samsara.</i> But the devotees of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  having  an  extreme
preponderance of <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion are endowed  with  pious  virtues
possessing all good qualities and as  such  they  attain  the  Supreme  Lord
Himself, Lord of lords, God of gods who is beyond birth and death.  Full  of
innumerable transcendental qualities and attributes like eternal  existence,
infinite  knowledge  and  immeasurable  bliss.  The  purport  is  that  Lord
Krishna's devotees  knowing  Him  to  be  the  are  endowed  with  a  nature
exclusively  devoted  to  Him  are  untouched  by  actions  of  duality  and
ignorance and are totally different from the devotees of other gods.
