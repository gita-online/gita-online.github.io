As to questions of how the soul is neither the instigator of any actions  or
the recepient of any actions, Lord Krishna  explains  that  the  soul  being
eternal is not subject to the six modifications of material existence  which
are: birth, being, growth, transformation, dimunition and  death.  The  soul
is never born and never dies at any time. How can this be? It  is  not  that
the soul did not exist before and will not exist in  the  future.  The  soul
exists eternally but  opting  the  experiences  of  the  material  existence
accepts a physical body. What did not exist in the past  but  is  manifested
only in the present is called conceived and that which exists now  but  will
cease to exist eventually is called dead. But the soul is not  conceived  as
it eternally exists and it will never die because it is immortal.  With  the
2 words ajah meaning unborn and nityah meaning eternal,  it  is  made  clear
that the 2 modifications of birth and death are not  applicable  in  regards
to the soul. In order to also negate the idea  of  the  soul  posessing  any
modifications by  even  being,  Lord  Krishna  explains  that  the  soul  is
everlasting which means it is free from being or unbeing.  The  modification
of any growth of  the  soul  is  neutralisd  by  the  word  puranah  meaning
ancient, that it always existed as it is. One posessing a body grows by  the
increase of the bodily parts; but the soul being bodiless does not  increase
it is the same eternally. The remaining 2  modifications  of  transformation
and dimunition are rendered inapplicable by inference in understanding  that
the soul being eternal without any need to increase remains as it is and  is
changeless. Hence the soul being bereft of any of the six  modifications  of
the physical body can never be destroyed even  when  the  physical  body  is
destroyed.
