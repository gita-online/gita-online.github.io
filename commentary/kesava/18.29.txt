Now Lord Krishna speaks about the  three  types  of  intellect  due  to  the
influence of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature.  He  begins  first
by  describing  one  situated  in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of  goodness  by
explaining that <i>buddhi</i> or intellect that correctly determines the  righteous
paths  of  action  which  accomplish  three  of  the  four  goals  of  human
existence: <i>kama</i> or enjoyment, <i>artha</i>  or  wealth,   <i>dharma</i>  or  righteousness
excluding <i>moksa</i> or liberation which is strived for when  one  in  the  final
stage of life has achieved renunciation from actions. Fear  is  not  knowing
what is to be done and fearless is knowing what is to be done  according  to
time, place and circumstances. S<i>amsara</i> is bondage to the perpetual cycle  of
birth and death. The cause of bondage is  attachment  to  the  pleasures  of
sense gratification. The cause of <i>moksa</i> is detachment from the pleasures  of
sense gratification. The word <i>buddhi</i>  meaning  intellect  denotes  the  word
<i>vetti</i>  meaning  understanding  by  which  ther  is  comprehension   and   is
universally known to that effect. So there is  no  contradiction  about  the
two in this light. It is like stating the sword severed the demons head  but
it means that someone wielding the sword severed the demons head.
