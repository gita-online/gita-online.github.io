How Lord Krishna performing actions helps the  maintenance  of
the  world  is  explained  here.  Whatever  actions  a   great
personality performs is accepted by the common people  as  the
path to follow due to their looking up to people in  positions
of leadership, royalty and fame etc.  Why  should  they  think
this way when it is a known fact that the Vedic scriptures are
the authority on all aspects of  life?  They  think  this  way
because they do not rely on the scriptures  they  depend  upon
the actions ot the visibly prominent in society to base  their
judhements.  So  whatever  a  prominent  member   of   society
postualtes whether it is Vedic or concocted the  ignorant  not
being knowlegeable will undoubtedly follow correct or not.
