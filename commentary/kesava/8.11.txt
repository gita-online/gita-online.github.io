After presenting the normal practice of meditation Lord  Krishna  introduces
the topmost method designated  by  the  word  <i>aksaram</i>  meaning  imperishable
which He promises to reveal in summary  how  to  attain  this  imperishable,
ultimate goal and  that  once  it  is  attained  the  Supreme  Lord  who  is
<i>saccidananda</i> or the embodiment of eternal truth, knowledge and  bliss  which
the Vaisnavas and Brahmins who are knowers of the Vedic scriptures  describe
as imperishable and indestructible. The Brhadaranyaka III.IX.VIII  states:To
this state the Brahmins attribute the term indestructible to that  which  is
not material and that  which  is  not  subtle,  etc.  This  state  is  where
determined ascetics free from passion and desire for  sense  objects  strive
to enter. This is the state where  the  enlightened  ascetics  perceive  the
experience of  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul  as  omnipresent  and  omniscient.  Their
consciousness resides in the highest  substratum  and  they  become  totally
detached from  contact  with  three  dimensional  material  nature  and  are
incapable as such of performing any action that is in  separation  from  the
Supreme Lord. They becoming His own, remain in this state adhering  to  Him,
taking  full  shelter  in  Him,  desiring  to  know  that  for   which   the
<i>brahmacarya's</i> or voluntary celibates remain firm in their vow.
