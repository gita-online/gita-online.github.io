Perfection in the form of  absolute  knowledge  is  performing  propitiation
unto the Supreme Lord Krishna or any  of  His  authorised  incarnations  and
expansions as ordained in Vedic  scriptures  in  accordance  to  ones's  own
natural propensity. Now He presents the resultant rewards  with  the  words:
One whose mind is unfettered and free from  attachment  to  anything,  whose
senses are totally subdued and completely under control, whose  desires  and
cravings have  all evaporated and cease to exist; such a one can  reach  the
Supreme state of perfection. This Supreme state is the highest devotion  and
is flowing and constant like the  purifying  flow  of  the  celestial  river
Ganges, in the form of constant meditation  and  continuous  remembrance  of
the divine form, divine qualities, divine sweetness and divine  pastimes  of
the effulgent Supreme Lord.
