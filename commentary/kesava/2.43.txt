Those addicted to material pleasures and earthly  delights  are  excessively
attracted by the flowery promises of the Vedic scriptures to  the  point  of
bewilderment. Their intelligence  being  unqualified  to  conceptualise  and
meditate upon the ultimate reality of devotion  to  Lord  Krishna  they  are
unfit and thus unable to perceive and realise the Supreme Lord. As they  are
of insufficient intelligence they are unable to  become  resolute  and  one-
pointed in consciousness because they perform no actions in devotion to  the
Supreme Lord.
