Among weapons Lord Krishna's <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental  opulence  is
the <i>vajram</i> or thunderbolt the  weapon  of  Indra,  chief  of  the  celestial
demigods. Among all cows His <i>vibhuti</i> is the <i>Kamadhenu</i> or Surabhi cows  which
fulfill all desires. His <i>vibhuti</i>  is  <i>kandarpah</i>  or  the  passionate  desire
which results in procreation of progeny. His <i>vibhuti</i>  is  not  connected  in
any way to the desire for sense gratification and bodily enjoyments.
