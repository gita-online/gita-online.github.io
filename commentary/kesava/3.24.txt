It is proper that  people  who  follow  the  example  of  Lord
Krishna are correct in their actions as He is  omniscient  and
the creator of all. But because He is the  Lord  of  all  what
would be wrong if He was not to  engage  Himself  in  actions.
Explaining  this  Lord  Krishna  uses  the  words  ime   lokah
utsideyuh meaning the inhabitants of all the  worlds  will  be
destroyed. If Lord Krishna, the Supreme Lord and  foremost  on
the path in knowledge of yoga or the uniting of the individual
consciousness with the ultimate  consciousness;  if  He  would
refrain from performing prescribed  Vedic  activities,  people
would follow His example  and  refrain  from  performing  such
actions also and  they  would  deviate  from  their  duty  and
deviate from dharma or righteousness. Then Lord Krishna  would
be to blame as by the example of  renouncing  actions  is  not
inspiring and beneficial for the worlds. When  the  duties  of
society are ommitted there is confusion in  society  and  such
confusion leads to a lax in moral standards resulting  in  the
mixture of different castes and unwanted children. The purport
is that great harm would be caused to the people  and  socitey
if Lord Krishna were to refrain from actions and so He  always
performs responsible actions for the welfare  and  benefit  of
the world.
