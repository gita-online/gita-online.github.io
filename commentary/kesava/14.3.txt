Lord Krishna reveals that all <i>jivas</i> or  embodied  beings  originate  by  the
combination of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence and the <i>purusa</i> or the supreme,  eternal  consciousness.  But  this
combination is determined by the will of the Supreme  Lord  and  is  not  an
accidental or random event as the impersonalists  of  the  Sankhya  doctrine
propound. The Supreme Lord is the cause of origin for all <i>jivas</i> or  embodied
beings and fully controls <i>prakriti</i> with its <i>gunas</i> or three modes  of  <i>sattva</i>
or goodness, <i>rajas</i> or  passion  and  <i>tamas</i>  or  ignorance.  This  primordial
matter known as <i>prakriti</i> is greater then all its  products  and  beyond  the
sway of space and time and is infinite because it is the  <i>ksetra</i>  or  sphere
of activity where the expansion  and  evolution  of  the  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied
beings is able to manifest. The all pervading, omniscient Supreme  Lord  the
source of both the animate and the inanimate  reflected  as  stated  in  the
Chandogya Upanisad VI.II.III beginning <i>tad-aikshata vahu svam</i>  meaning:  The
Supreme Lord glanced upon <i>prakriti</i> and impregnated it for the  evolution  of
innumerable <i>jivas</i> in totality. The manifestation of all  <i>jivas</i>  from  Brahma
to a one-celled  amoeba  is  a  combination  of  the  sentient  <i>purusa</i>t  and
insentient <i>prakriti</i>. When the Supreme Lord perceives that  the  <i>jiva</i>  having
an absence of <i>sattva</i> is oblivious to the <i>ksetrajna</i> or knower of  the  sphere
of activity and is in possession  of   the  latencies  of  <i>tamas</i>  and  <i>rajas</i>
desiring to reap the rewards of their past actions they are  bonded  to  the
lower potency known as the <i>ksetra</i> or sphere of activity in the  form  of  an
appropriate physical body.<i>.</i>

Now Lord Krishna explains in brief the true nature of the <i>ksetra</i>  the  field
of activity and the <i>ksetra-jna</i> the knower of  the  field.  The  relationship
the  <i>ksetra</i>  has  with  the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>  and  the  consciousness  which   is
established in Him. Knowledge of  the  <i>ksetra</i>  means  what  type  entity  is
embodied and the qualities are what modifications restricts it and  what  is
its means of evolving itself  through the interrelationship  of  matter  and
spirit. And of the <i>ksetra-jna</i> exactly what is the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul,  who
is the knower of the <i>ksetra</i> and what is its powers and potencies.
