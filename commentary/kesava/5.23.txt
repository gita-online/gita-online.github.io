After instructing about withstanding  the  impulses  of  <i>kama</i>  or  lust  and
<i>krodha</i> or anger Lord Krishna reveals the  confidential  means  of  achieving
<i>atma tattva</i> or  realisation  of  the  soul  and  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material  existence  by  the  compound   word   <i>antah-jyotih</i>   which   means
illuminated  within.  One  who  finds  delight  internally  within  and  not
externally in the fleeting pleasures of  material  existence  which  are  so
difficult to acquire and  sustain.  Such  a  person  engaged  in  performing
meditation on the <i>atma</i> or soul without  any  vestige  of  <i>maya</i>  or  illusion
experiences bliss identifying exclusively with the <i>Brahman</i> or the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence which is of the pure nature of the  <i>atma</i>.
