A question  may  be  raised  that  the  spiritually  wise  may
sometimes perform actions  that  are  also  performed  by  the
ignorant then what is the difference? Lord  Krishna  clarifies
this point with the word prakriteh meaning the material nature
which is impelling actions through the  medium  of  the  three
gunas  being  the  modes  of  prakriti   known  as  sattva  or
goodness, rajas or passion and tamas or nescience. One who  is
perplexed by false ego believes that  they  are  the  physical
body and that the physical body  is  the  doer  of  all  their
actions.

On the scriptural authority of the Vedas the atma or  soul  is
the doer but this is fully  experienced  only  when  moksa  or
liberation  from   material   existence   is   attained.   The
impressions of the atma  filter  through  the  medium  of  the
physical body in proportion to the  purity  of  the  mind.  In
Brahma Sutra  II.III.XXXIII we see in the verse that the  atma
is the  doer.  Yet  because  the  knowledge  of  a  person  in
ignorance is limited the filtering process is  negligible  and
they perceive their physical body as the  doer  of  all  their
actions when in actuality all actions  are  performed  by  the
interaction of material nature, the three gunas and the  false
ego. Because of this the ignorant whose minds  are  completely
bewildered by false ego believe falsely that  they  are  their
bodies and that they are the doer of their actions.
