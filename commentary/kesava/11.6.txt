Lord Krishna states <i>pasya</i> or behold enumerating a few of His  <i>vibhutis</i>  that
have been described previously such as the Adityas,  Rudras,  etc.  and  all
the demigods also which are able to be perceived  within  His  <i>visvarupa</i>  or
divine universal form. Besides these there  are  other  unlimited  forms  of
marvel and wonder that have never before been seen by anyone.
