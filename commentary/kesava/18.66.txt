Now Lord Krishna declares that whoever studies  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  under
the tutelage of the spiritual preceptor and learns its purport from him;  by
this act Lord Krishna accepts it as propitiation  to  Him  if  the  form  of
wisdom as He previously affirmed in chapter  4,  verse  28  with  the  words
<i>svadhyaya-jnana-yajnah ca</i> or propitiation by study of the Vedic  scriptures.
So worship of the Supreme Lord is accomplished by study  and  discussion  of
the purports, yet His devotee who simply chants or sings  only  the  verses,
because they are faithfully eulogising Him they are  pleasing  Him  and  are
dearmost due to aurally hearing from themselves of His gloriesl. Just  as  a
common  person  may  sing  a  song  extolling  the  virtues  of  some  great
personality; such a  great personality hearing it will be come most  pleased
and that common person will become  dear  to  them.  So  in  this  way  Lord
Krishna is affirming that just by reciting the verses  of  Srimad  Bhagavad-
Gita one will become dear to Him as one will be glorifying Him by doing  so.
