There is still another group of human beings who experience an  even  higher
level of experience. They are the <i>yatis</i> or <i>sannyasis</i> those  who  have  given
up wife, children, occupation, all they have and give  everything  to  serve
the lotus feet of the servant of the servant of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
For such enlightened renunciates <i>moksa</i> or liberation is present every  where
they go in everything they do.
