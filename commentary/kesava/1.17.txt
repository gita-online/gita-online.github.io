Another source of fear for Duryodhana is indicated  by  the  description  of
how the tumultuous blasts  of  the  mighty  warriors  of  the  Pandava  army
sounding their conchshells shattered the hearts  of  Duryodhana's  army  the
Kauravas. Shattering the heart means the  sound  created  excruciating  pain
within their hearts due to its volatile nature.  How was this  accomplished?
By the violent  force  contained  within  the  blasts  which  reverberating,
filled the earth and the sky with echoes.
