The  ignorant  who  indifferently  disregard  the  Vedic  scriptures   while
performing their own religious rituals  with  faith  will  find  such  faith
divided into one of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of  material  nature  as  well.
The <i>gunas</i> known as <i>sattva guna, raja guna</i> and <i>tama guna</i>  correspond  to  the
modes of goodness, passion and  ignorance  respectively.  But  because  they
disrespect the ordinances and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures they  must
be excluded from those who are endowed with the divine nature and  are  thus
unqualified for all four goals of human development  which  are    <i>artha</i>  or
wealth, <i>kama</i> or pleasure, <i>dharma</i>  or  spiritual  development  and  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence. They are only qualified  for  two  <i>artha</i>
and <i>kama; y</i>et due to having some faith and piety they cannot be  categorised
as those possessing demoniac qualities; but neither can they  be  considered
as endowed with divine qualities.
<p>
To clarify this discrepancy  Lord  Krishna  will  now  answer  what  is  the
position of those such as these with misplaced faith  due  to  ignorance  of
the absolute authority of the Vedic scriptures. Those who  practice  extreme
vows  of  self  deprecation  such   as   emaciating   fasting,   masochistic
flagellation, sadistic tormenting of the physical body, etc.  all  of  which
are not enjoined and sanctioned by the Vedic scriptures; simply  enact  them
out of ostentation and egoism out of delusion in  an  attempt  for  perverse
material gains.  Abusing and torturing  the  physical  body  containing  the
<i>atma</i> or immortal soul, they disrespect themselves and the  Supreme  Lord  as
well who abides therein  and  cause  the  <i>atma</i>  to  enter  lower  and  lower
degraded species of existence where misery and suffering are unending.  Know
that such  living  entities  possess  the  demoniac  nature  and  should  be
vigilantly  avoided  by  all  means  because  they  flagrantly  disobey  the
commands of the Supreme Lord by disregarding the Vedic  scriptures.  Because
the demoniac transgress the Vedic scriptures wilfully  and  even  spitefully
they never can obtain lasting happiness because they  constantly  engage  in
activities antagonistic to the Supreme Lord.  Instead  they  fall  into  the
foulest and excruciating of hells to suffer interminably.
