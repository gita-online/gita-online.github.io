Lord Krishna appeared as the son of  King  Vasudeva  from  the
Vrishni dynasty,  the  foremost  of  the  righteous.  If  Lord
Krishna was to fail to  perform  prescribed  Vedic  activities
then  so  many  lesser  personalities  would  follow  in   His
footsteps thinking that  is  the  standard.  Lord  Krishna  is
stating that He would be at fault for leading them falsely  in
the wrong way.
