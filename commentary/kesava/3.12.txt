Evaluating the previous verse  Lord  Krishna  points  out  the
offense in not performing yagna or worship and first  offering
of the fruits of yagna.before enjoying them.  One  who  enjoys
before first offering worship and appeasement and  prayers  is
undoubtedly a thief and will be punished like a thief  at  the
end of their life by Yamaraja the minister of death.
