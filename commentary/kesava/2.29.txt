It may be postulated that in regard to the physical body which  is  actually
the transformation of insentient primordial matter that it will merge  again
into its origins at the end. But such is not the case  here.   The  soul  is
always referred to as being eternal. This is  because  it  is  immutable  by
nature. The soul is  extremely  difficult  to  realise  due  to  its  supra-
subtlety but it does not become perceptible simply because it  is  different
from the physical body. So the soul is referred to in this  verse  as  being
amazing.  It is those beings out of millions of beings who  by  devotion  to
Lord Krishna have received the mercy to be  free  from  physical  attachment
and purify their hearts in order to perceive their soul, they see  the  soul
as amazing. In what way is the soul amazing? The soul is more  amazing  than
anything experienced previously because it  is  transcendent  to  everything
experienced in the material existence. It is not only  amazing  to  the  one
who perceives the soul as amazing but also to the  preceptor  who  describes
the soul as amazing and to the disciple who learns from the  preceptor  that
the soul is amazing as well. There is nothing  in  material  existence  that
the soul can be compared with.  So some others although  hearing  about  the
soul are still unable to  comprehend  it.  The  understanding  is  that  the
perceiver of the  soul,  the  preceptor  who  describes  the  soul  and  the
disciple who learns about the soul are all  exceedingly  difficult  to  gain
association with in life.
