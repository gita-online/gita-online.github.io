Preparing to bestow His Grace, Lord Krishna extols the teachings  of  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita that have been imparted and concluded the instructions with  a
summary of what He has revealed thus far regarding  renunciation,  devotion,
action and knowledge. Now  He  gives  the  instruction  to  contemplate  and
reflect upon the three paths of <i>karma yoga</i> or  facilitating  communion  with
the Supreme Lord by action, <i>bhakti yoga</i> or facilitating communion  with  the
Supreme Lord by exclusive loving devotion and  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  or  facilitating
communion with the Supreme Lord by knowledge. After examining the  teachings
thoroughly and considereing carefully  resolve  accordingly  the  manner  in
which they are to be implemented into reality.
