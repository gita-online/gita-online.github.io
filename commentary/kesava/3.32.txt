Here Lord Krishna points out that those persons who disrespect
and ignore and refuse to follow the edicts and injunctions  of
the Bhagavad-Gita that are for the benefit of all mankind  are
fools, bereft of spiritual knowledge and in such  a  state  of
ignorance  all  their  activities  are  fruitless   and   they
hopelessly revolve in the cycle of birth and death, birth  and
death, birth and death, ad infinitum.
