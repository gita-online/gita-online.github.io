Therefore a person sincerely seeking their eternal well  being  should  rely
on <i>yoga</i> more than any other means for accomplishing the fundamental  purpose
of  human  existence.  The  <i>yogi</i>  or  one  perfecting  the  science  of  the
individual consciousness with the ultimate consciousness is superior to  the
ascetics who practice ritualistic austerities like the  fasting  vows  which
follow the cycle of the moon. The <i>yogi</i> is regarded to be superior  to  those
who are well versed and knowledgeable of the Vedic scriptures and a <i>yogi</i>  is
also superior to those who perform prescribed Vedic activities for  fruitive
results like an <i>Agnihotra</i> or  fire  sacrifice.  Therefore  Lord  Krishna  is
encouraging Arjuna to be a <i>yogi.</i>
