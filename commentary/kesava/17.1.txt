In the preceding chapter the Supreme Lord Krishna spoke  of  the  difference
between those endowed with  the  divine  nature  and  those  possessing  the
demoniac nature. He described the qualities of each and emphasised that  the
divine endowments should be cultivated and embellished  while  the  demoniac
nature should be rejected and  avoided  by  all  means.  This  confirms  the
reality that to become qualified for spiritual knowledge  an  aspirant  must
be exclusively situated in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  or  the  mode  of  goodness  which
empowers one to perform only actions that are  in  harmony  with  the  Vedic
scriptures. Furthermore Lord Krishna established the fact that the  absolute
authority of the Vedic scriptures is the exclusive reference  to  understand
what is proper and  what  is  improper,  what  is  acceptable  and  what  is
unacceptable and no  other  source  is  warranted.  One  should  accept  the
impeccable authority of the  Vedic  scriptures  wholeheartedly  and  act  in
accordance with the  Vedic  ordinances  and  injunctions  which  bestow  the
highest benefit for all creation while avoiding  the  prohibitions  as  they
lead only to degradation and sin. Acting contradictory to any aspect of  the
Vedic scriptures are activities of <i>raja  guna</i>  the  mode  of  passion  while
indifference to them is <i>tama guna</i> the  mode  of  ignorance.  Both  of  these
modes definitely insures that  one  will  incarnate  into  lower  and  lower
species of life such as  dogs,  pigs  and  reptiles.  Those  who  spitefully
disregard the Vedic scriptures and  insidiously  disrespect  the  authorised
promulgators of the Vedic scriptures are certainly of  the  demoniac  nature
and as such they degenerate into the most degraded existences.

Lord Krishna begins the seventeenth chapter explaining the  three  types  of
faith found in those possessing characteristics of each <i>guna</i>  regarding  the
types of food one eats, the type  of  rituals  one  performs,  the  kind  of
austerities one undertakes etc. Any  action  executed  with  faith  that  is
dominated by evil intentions resides in <i>tama guna</i> and  is  characterised  by
demoniac  conceptions  and  activities  hence  enslavement  and  bondage  in
material existence. But there  are  some  who  out  of  ignorance,  lack  of
exposure or unawareness do not adhere to the ordinances and  injunctions  of
the  Vedic  scriptures.  Yet  they  also  avoid  indulgence  in   prohibited
activities due to desiring respect in society. What will be the position  of
such a one? Occasionally they will sincerely perform some ritual  or  follow
some austerity with faith and even though they are not  engaging  in  sinful
prohibitions because they ignore  the  ordinances  and  injunctions  of  the
Vedic scriptures they  still  possess  demoniacal  characteristics.  So  the
query is how are they categorised?
<p>
Although they are indifferent to the Vedic scriptures  such  beings  worship
lesser gods and are following inferior  conceptions.  Some  adhere  to  such
conceptions due to fear of going to  hell,  some  due  to  tradition,  still
others due to acceptance in society. They have  no  interest  in  the  Vedic
scriptures and have never even considered the meaning  of  existence  having
no desire to understand why they were born and in  knowing  the  purpose  of
life. If they have heard about the Vedic scriptures they regard them as  not
applying to them or consider them  to  be  below  the  level  of  their  own
scriptures which they have never adequately  studied  or  comprehended.  The
irrefutable evidence is  that there is extremely limited  information  about
the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul in any  of  the  religious  conceptions  on  Earth
except in the Vedic scriptures and any credible reference to  the  <i>atma</i>  can
only be taken from the Vedic scriptures as the source.  The  most  important
ingredient of  human  existence  is  immortality  of  the  soul  and  it  is
completely missing in the consciousness of  humanity  except  in  the  Vedic
culture where it is fully comprehended.  The  word  <i>sraddhaya-anvitah</i>  means
faithfully. Such faith arises from traditional belief in god  and  religious
scriptures. One who is ignorant of the Vedic scriptures  is  different  from
one who is opposed to the Vedic scriptures. So what is the  truth  regarding
those who are not opposed to the Vedic scriptures but only  indifferent  due
to following their own traditions and what is there position?  This  is  the
question Lord Krishna will begin to fully explain in the next verse.
