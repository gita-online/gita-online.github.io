One might speculate that if one can achieve  purity  of  heart  through  the
practice of <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed  Vedic  activities  and  hence  acquire
knowledge by this effort then  what  is  the  necessity  for  approaching  a
spiritual master as spoken of in verse thirty four? To  lay  this  doubt  to
rest Lord Krishna specifically states who is qualified to receive  spiritual
knowledge. A person  may  acquire  knowledge  by  themselves  but  here  are
presented all the  qualities  that  are  essential  for  such  a  person  to
succeed. The word <i>sraddhavan</i> means a person who has faith. Faith  is  firmly
believing. Believing is something that must have  a  source  from  where  it
believed in.  Verily that source is the words of the  spiritual  master  who
reveals the inner meaning of the Vedic scriptures by explaining them  in  an
way that is easy to understand. But this is not enough there  must  also  be
sincere devoted service to the spiritual master  while  studying  the  Vedic
scriptures under his tutelage. But there is more one  must  also  avoid  the
association of  those  who  are  not  following  the  Vedic  injunctions  as
association with them may cause one to deviate from the  path  of  knowledge
in spite of having faith and be captivated once again by  <i>maya</i>  or  illusion
neglecting  to  study  the  Vedic  scriptures  and  omitting  to  serve  the
spiritual master. So only  one  who  is  self-controlled  attains  spiritual
knowledge and  acquiring  such  knowledge  one  neutralises  all  extraneous
activities and perceives the <i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence and from there achieves <i>atma tattva</i> or  soul  realisation  and
from that platform attains <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence.   So
a person of faith must follow the age old process in the proper sequence  to
attain the coveted goal.
