Exactly in what manner do the <i>mahatmanas</i> or  the  great  souls  worship  the
Supreme Lord?
The word <i>satatam</i> means always. Lord Krishna by  the  use  of  this  word  is
emphasising that the <i>mahatmanas</i>  are  incessantly  worshipping  Him  in  all
ways. Such devotees of Lord Krishna with choked up voices  and  tear  filled
eyes from ecstatic feelings of joy and love due to meditating upon His  form
and attributes within their hearts. Because Lord Krishna is  extremely  dear
they always chant  His  holy  names  such  as  Keshava,  Madhava,  Vasudeva,
Mukunda, Hari which are synonymous  with  Him  specifically  expressing  His
attributes and glories. These attributes and glories are described in  Vedic
literatures and devotional hymns and the Supreme Lord is worshipped  through
the chanting and singing of His glories, in  propitiation  and  salutations,
by offering humble obeisance's and worship,  enlightening  one  another  and
enacting His <i>lilas</i> or divine pastimes which are all factually  the cause  of
His grace.
<p>
The purpose of life for the <i>mahatmanas</i> is to  attain  the  Supreme  Lord  as
their only goal and they bow down to Him always again  and  again  upon  the
ground in temples and in courtyards, falling down outstretched  like  sticks
with the eight parts of their body being the head, the two  hands,  the  two
feet, their heart, their intellect and their ego. Such  great  devotees  are
of firm resolve and so full of <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion  for  Lord  Krishna
that they are unable to bear even  the  slightest  separation  from  Him  in
their minds and action. It is also not possible for  them  to  tolerate  any
kind of diversion or deviation in their devotional service  to  the  Supreme
Lord, rejecting even relatives and family members if they  cause  hindrances
and disturbances.
