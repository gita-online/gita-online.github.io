The question may be  raised  when  does  true  knowledge  of  the  spiritual
reality reveal itself? Lord Krishna describes this beginning with the  words
<i>tad buddhayas</i> meaning when one's intelligence is focused in  Him  and  whose
sinful reactions have been eradicated by spiritual  knowledge.  The  purport
is just as one shrouded in ignorance suffers <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual  cycle
of birth and death. One who by the strength of mind has perceived  the  <i>atma</i>
or soul within is no longer affected by this transmigratory  existence  full
of all types of evil and is untouched by the characteristics of <i>samsara.</i>
