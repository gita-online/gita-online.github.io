This verse gives the keys to  being  free  from  reactions  which  leads  to
bondage in the material existence. If one performs all  activities  in  this
manner they will neutralise reactions  to  bodily  actions  but  will  still
remain bound if there is still any affection for previous actions  that  are
presently being renounced. To this Lord  Krishna  emphasises  being  content
with whatever comes, unsought, by its own accord. Being satisfied  in  one's
mind with material things coming unexpected  without  the  least  desire  or
motivation for more and no effort to receive them. If one gets or  does  not
get their mind remains  equipoise  in  tranquility  and  never  agitated  by
dualities such as success and failure, jubilation and sadness,  triumph  and
disaster, elation and despondency, achievement and non-achievement.  Such  a
spiritually enlightened being never performs an action that is devoid  of  a
connection to the Supreme Being of all.  Thus  such  a  person  situated  in
Vedic knowledge can never  have  a  selfish  motive  or  perform  a  selfish
action; on the contrary even if such a person is requested to perform  <i>yagna</i>
or worship to the Supreme Lord on behalf of someone else and that person  is
blemished or tainted by material desires then even still  one  will  not  be
affected by any reactions for performing such an  activity  to  the  Supreme
Lord due to they are in knowledge.

Some explain in  this  verse  that  a  <i>yogi</i>  or  one  who  developing  their
individual consciousness to be in communion with the ultimate  consciousness
after renouncing all desires  and  enjoyments,  including  even  begging  to
sustain their physical sustenance should maintain  themselves  by  accepting
what comes unsought by its own accord and this insures  that  their  actions
become inaction and not subject to reactions.  In the normal  sense  such  a
person appears to be begging to worldly people but in actual fact  according
to the injunctions of the  Vedic  scriptures  this  not  the  case  and  the
actions of such a <i>yogi</i>  are factually inaction. In this manner such  a  <i>yogi</i>
performs activity for the maintenance of their body by only  accepting  what
comes unsought by its own accord even though for society it  appears  as  if
one is begging. Also such a <i>yogi</i> incurs no negative results in the  form  of
reactions by behaving so  because  all  reactions  leading  to  bondage  are
destroyed by the fire of knowledge. But this explanation  does  not  fit  in
the context of this verse because of the  flaw  of  being  repetitive.  This
point was already  established  in  the  previous  verse  and  actions  like
begging to maintain physical sustenance  are  factually  no  different  from
natural bodily management. So then the  speaking  of  this  verse  would  be
superfluous and that is not the case. Also it is clear  that  if  one  takes
this verse to refer to a <i>yogi</i> then there would be  a  contradiction  in  the
succeeding two verses as well because in these verses the  action  of  <i>yagna</i>
or worship of the Supreme Lord is presented and a <i>yogi</i> is  not  entitled  to
perform any  sacrificial  rituals.  Only  the  Vaisnavas  and  the  Brahmins
following the Vedic injunctions have the  authority  and  are  empowered  to
perform Vedic rituals. So  it  is  not  possible  to  properly  explain  the
context of this verse in reference to a <i>yogi</i> because of impropriety and  the
correct understanding of this  verse  is  in  reference  to  a  Vaisnava  or
Brahmin devotee of the  Supreme Lord  Krishna  who  is  without  desire  and
attachment and who is situated in <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation.  This
also applies to a Vaisnava or Brahmin  devotee  of  any  of  Lord  Krishna's
authorised incarnations and expansions.
