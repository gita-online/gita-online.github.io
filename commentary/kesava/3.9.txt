As is revealed in many passages in the Vedic scriptures  that:
One who has realised the effulgent Supreme Lord  becomes  free
from  all  bondage.  The  smrti  scriptures  also  state  that
jivas, living entities are bound by actions and  declare  that
all actions are ropes of bondage. So  Arjuna  might  postulate
why he is being motivated  to  execute  actions.  Anticipating
this Lord Krishna states in this verse:  yagna-arthat  meaning
acts of sacrifice. Everyone is bound by their actions but  the
actions that are prescribed in  the  Vedic  scriptures  as  an
offerring to the  Supreme  Lord  cause  no  bondage.   Actions
performed according to the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures
is declared as sacrifice and verily is non-different from  the
Supreme Lord Himself. So with firm faith and proper  procedure
one should do their duty for the sake of the Supreme and  make
it an offerring without  attachment  as  propitiation  to  the
Supreme Lord.
