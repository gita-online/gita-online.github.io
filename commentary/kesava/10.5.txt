Nevertheless the seven great sages being Marici,  Atri,  Angiras,  Pulastya,
Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha followed later by Bhrgu  and  others  sages.  The
four elder seers being the Kumaras:  Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanat  and  Sanatana
were  born  even  earlier  to  these  sages  and  the  14  Manus  headed  by
Svayambhuva and also before Shivas 11 Rudras were  manifested.  All  of  the
aforementioned fully consider the Supreme Lord Krishna to  be  the  ultimate
creator, preserver and destroyer of the complete material manifestation  and
all  are  completely  devoted  to  the  Supreme  Lord  without   reservation
following His direction in all situations and  circumstances.  Sometimes  it
may externally appear as  if  they  are  bewildered  or  belligerent  as  it
sometimes appears in the case of Shiva; but  these  mirages  are  merely  to
enhance the <i>lila</i> or divine pastimes of Lord Krishna.  His devotees  to  whom
He grants <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material  existence  were  originally
created from His will, not from the womb of any female and  from  the  seven
great sages along with the four Kumaras, the 14 Manus  and  11  Rudras  have
descended the entire  human  population  producing  sons,  grandsons,  great
grandsons etc. all within the  scope  of  the  four  orders  being  Brahmin,
Ksatriya, Vaisya and sudra in  accordance  with  their  previous  respective
actions.
<p>
It should be understood that Brahma being empowered  by  the  will  of  Lord
Krishna manifested the four Kumara's and the Rudra's from  his  mind.  While
Svayambhuva Manu and his  wife  Satarupa  were  manifestations  of  the  two
halves of the golden egg from whence sprang creation in one  age  as  willed
by the Supreme Lord. The 13 subsequent Manus were born from a mothers  womb.
The four Kumara's created earlier  had  no  interest  in  producing  progeny
being indifferent to material  nature.  Thus  the  seven  great  sages  were
empowered with the task of procreation the population  of  humans  and  they
also   become   world   preceptors   establishing   and   propagating    the
<i>Vedic</i> religion through the medium of  actions. The Manu's are empowered  for
universal protection. The Rudra's are empowered for  universal  destruction.
The four Kumara's being themselves great liberated beings are  empowered  to
liberate others from the cycle of birth and death  throughout  creation  and
to establish and propagate the path of detachment and renunciation from  the
material. In the Moksa Dharma it is stated after the  origin  of  the  seven
great sages that they are knowers of  the  Vedas  and  are  known  as  world
preceptors appointed for begetting progeny. Similarly after the  account  of
the Kumara's it states that after attaining <i>atma tattva</i> or soul  realisation
they resorted to the path of renunciation and being experts in <i>yoga</i>  or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate  consciousness,  they  are  universally  known  as  liberated  holy
preceptors.
<p>
Manu's protect and Rudra's destroy.  In  the  Visnu  Purana  is  stated:  O'
brahmins, Visnu, Manu, Rudra and others as well as all beings exemplify  the
glory of the Supreme Lord Krishna. In the Bhagavat Purana,  II.VII.V  Brahma
states: O' ascetics I performed  penance  to  create  all  the  various  and
diverse beings. First arising  from  my  penance  <i>Sana</i>  was  produced  which
became Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanat and Sanantana known as  the  four  Kumara's.
To them I gave instructions about the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul in  all  sentient
beings and which became  dormant  at  the  end  of  the  previous  cycle  of
existence. Also in the Bhagavat Purana  XI.XIII.XIV  beginning  <i>etavan  yoga</i>
<i>adisto</i> Lord Krishna states: The actual system of yoga taught by My  devotees
headed by Sanaka  Kumara  is  to  completely  withdraw  the  mind  from  the
external senses directly concentrating it on the Supreme Lord.
<p>
It should never mistakenly be considered that the seven great sages  existed
previously before the Manu's and the Kumara's as this  would  be  erroneous.
The Kumara's are absolutely elder even to the Manu's  and  their  names  and
number equalling four  does  not  include  any  of  the  14  Manus  who  are
enumerated in  the  Puranas  as  follows:  Svayambhuva,  Svarocisa,  Uttama,
Tamasa,  Raivata,  Caksusa,  Vaivasvata,  Savarni,  Daksa  Sarvani,   Brahma
Sarvani, Dharma Sarvani, Rudra Sarvani, Deva Sarvani and Indra Sarvani.  Out
of these 14 Manus the first six have  already  served  out  there  appointed
time and passed. We are presently protected by the  seventh  Manu  known  as
Vaivasvata and the Markandaya Purana, Saptasati XIII.XXI confirms  that  the
eighth Manu will be called Sarvani. So in conclusion it  should  be  crystal
clear that the Manu's are elder to the seven great sages and that  the  four
Kumara's are even senior to the Manu's.
