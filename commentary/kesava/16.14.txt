After describing the activities and characteristics of  those  possessing  a
demoniac nature; Lord Krishna explains  in  this  verse  and  the  next  the
consequence of such. The demoniac are the vilest among created beings.  They
are evil, diabolical,  devilish,  cruel,   sinful  and  spiteful;  executing
abominable activities that are always opposed to Lord  Krishna  and  <i>sanatan</i>
<i>dharma</i> the path of eternal righteousness. The  Supreme  Lord  who  is  fully
cognizant of every aspect of His creation, continuously awards the  demoniac
the opportunity to oppose Him by assuring that the demoniac are hurled  into
demoniac wombs birth after birth after birth in order  that  their  venomous
nature can increase against Him which is their innate compulsive obsession.
