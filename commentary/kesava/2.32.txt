Normally one achieves well being after great effort whereas Arjuna  is  able
to achieve it without any effort. This is indicated by the words  yadrcchaya
upapannam arrived at on its own accord. It is only the most fortunate  among
ksatriyas who get such  unsolicited  opportunities  without  effort.  For  a
ksatriya who fights bravely war brings fame and opulence in  this  life  and
the  next.  By  engaging  in  battle  for  a  righteous   cause   exhibiting
outstanding valour one's glory is guaranteed. But what happens to those  who
are slain? Here Lord Krishna confirms that for  the  valorous  who  fall  in
battle there is an open door directly to the heavenly planets  the  same  as
for the yogis who fall short of achieving liberation.
