It is considered by Arjuna that this <i>yoga</i> or the science of  the  individual
consciousness  attaining   communion   with   the   ultimate   consciousness
instructed by Lord Krishna and the beholding of  all  living  entities  with
the same equal vision is next to  impossible.  Such  <i>yoga</i>  characterised  by
fixed mental discipline he could not comprehend as being steady  and  stable
due to the nature of the mind.
