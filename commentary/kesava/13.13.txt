Lord Krishna is pointing out that His devotees  are  particularly  qualified
and reveals what they achieve by being devoted to Him.  Beginning  with  the
words <i>iti ksetram tatha jnanam</i> meaning knowledge of the  field  of  activity
He is referring to the <i>ksetra</i> of five fundamental elements, the senses,  ego
and mind, etc. described in verses 6 and 7. The words  <i>tatha  jnanam</i>  refers
to the 20 super excellent spiritual endowments  given  in  verses  8  to  12
beginning <i>amanitvam</i> or reverence where concluding  this  theme  He  confirms
that factual knowledge of <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation  and  the  <i>ksetra-</i>
<i>jna</i> or knower  of  the  field  of  activity  is  actual  knowledge  and  all
knowledge that does not  facilitate  this  realisation  is  nescience.  From
their to verse 18 is described in a nutshell how imbibing the  20  spiritual
endowments lead to this realisation  and  concludes  by  revealing  that  He
resides in the etheric heart of all living beings and that invariably it  is
His devotees by virtue of  their possessing these spiritual endowments  that
are able to attain Him. This is denoted by  the  word  <i>vijnaya</i>  or  knowing.
Knowing the true nature of the <i>ksetra</i> or field of activity by virtue of  the
20 spiritual endowments is the  means  to  realise  the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>  or  the
knower of the field of activity which is the  <i>atma</i>  the  immortal  soul  and
transcends <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and  death.  The  conclusion
is that Lord  Krishna's  devotees  knowing  the  true  nature  of  spiritual
eternity and what is the ultimate reality qualify themselves faithfully  and
enthusiastically in His exclusive loving devotion.
