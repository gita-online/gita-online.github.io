Thus after presenting the characteristics and conduct of one who  transcends
the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of materual nature; now Lord  Krishna  reveals  the
unfailing  method  to  insure  success  in  a  comprehensive  manner.   Mere
discrimination and contemplation of the <i>gunas</i> is not  sufficient  enough  to
overcome them. This is because the  removal  of  their  effects  which  have
germinating for unlimited lifetimes  needs  an  equally  powerful  means  to
remove their emeshed fettering in the senses and  the  subtle  consciousness
that have been prevalent since  time  immemorial.  Now  the  omnipotent  and
omniscient Supreme Lord Krishna the bestower of  fearlessness  through  <i>yoga</i>
or the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion with  the
ultimate consciousness through <i>bhakti yoga</i> or exclusive loving  devotion  to
Him. Being most benevolent, merciful and compassionate  to  His  surrendered
devotees who have no other shelter but Him; He explains  that  although  the
three <i>gunas</i> are practically insurmountable one can transcend them by  <i>bhakti</i>
<i>yoga</i> and reaching the  absolute  state  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence one will  be  elligible  to  attain  Him.
Thus by qualification all ones sins  will  be  dissolved,  one  will  become
omniscient, one will be bestowed an imperishable spiritual body  and  relish
association with the Supreme Lord that  is  consistent  with  one's  eternal
nature.
The particle <i>ca</i> is used to emphasize and express ascertainment of this.  The
word <i>anyabhicarena</i> meaning unadulterated denotes  devotion  to  the  Supreme
Lord exclusively. For the worship of other, lesser  gods  is  equivalent  to
lack of faith in the Supreme Lord Krishna and His teachings of the Bhagavad-
Gita which are paramount and superior to all of the teachings of  all  other
gods combined. Such faithlessness in the Supreme Lords  teaching  which  are
for the benefit of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings  is  the  most  heinious  of
sins and such a one becomes their own worst enemy blocking  all  opportunity
for spiritual advancement. As is stated in the  Brahmanda  Purana:  One  who
worships anything other then the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or  His  authorised
incarnations revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures  will  never  attain  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence and <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of  birth
and death. The Narada Pancaratra states; That one who out  of  ignorance  or
infatuation considers the Supreme Lord krishna as equal to any other god  is
indeed a <i>jiva</i> of the lowest order even if not born in the lowest  order  and
the Kurma Purana states: That one who thinks of the Supreme  Lord  as  equal
to lesser gods is considered a heinious offender and such  a  most  wretched
<i>jiva</i>  is elligible for the fiery hellish realms.
