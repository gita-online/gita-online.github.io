The third chapter established that one desiring  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
the cycle of birth and death, whose desires for sense gratification had  not
been extinguished should engage themselves in <i>karma yoga</i> or  performance  of
prescribed Vedic activities assisted by some  Vedic  knowledge  and  feeling
completely free from the fear of falling from one's  position.  Everyone  is
not qualified for <i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of  Vedic  wisdom  and  even
those who  are  qualified  should  still  follow  the  path  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>
performing prescribed Vedic activities as a matter of duty as an example  to
the common man for the maintenance of world order.
<p>
Now in the fourth chapter Lord Krishna explains <i>karma yoga</i> in the  light  of
historical tradition and that by instructing the knowledge of  <i>yoga</i>  or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness, He Himself performed  <i>karma  yoga</i>  in  giving  these
instructions in the past to Visvavan the demigod of the sun and now  to  His
friend Arjuna because he is His  surrendered  disciple.  It  should  not  be
thought that Lord Krishna is speaking it just to motivate Arjuna  to  battle
or that the science of this eternal <i>yoga</i> is recent  because  it  was  spoken
before 120 million years previously at the commencement of this time  period
of Manu in order to  protect  all  the  worlds.  Lord  Krishna  taught  this
imperishable <i>yoga</i> for the highest benefit of the human species and  for  the
preservation  of  universal  order.  Visvavan  after  gave  it  to  his  son
Satyavrata who was the Manu of that time period and he later gave it to  his
eldest son Iksvaku.
