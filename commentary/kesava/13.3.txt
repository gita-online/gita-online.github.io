Now Lord Krishna explains in brief the true nature of the <i>ksetra</i>  the  field
of activity and the <i>ksetra-jna</i> the knower of  the  field.  The  relationship
the  <i>ksetra</i>  has  with  the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>  and  the  consciousness  which   is
established in Him. Knowledge of  the  <i>ksetra</i>  means  what  type  entity  is
embodied and the qualities are what modifications restricts it and  what  is
its means of evolving itself  through the interrelationship  of  matter  and
spirit. And of the <i>ksetra-jna</i> exactly what is the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul,  who
is the knower of the <i>ksetra</i> and what is its powers and potencies.
