Here Lord Krishna speaks of the merits  one  acquires  who  knows  the  true
nature of His divine appearances as <i>sac-cid-ananda</i>  or  eternity,  knowledge
and bliss and also knows the divine  nature  of  his  <i>lila's</i>  or  phenomenal
pastimes which he accomplishes by his internal potency without any touch  of
material nature. One who has realised the truth  of  His  reality  does  not
take rebirth again being freed from their gross physical  body  as  well  as
their subtle body which is the cause of having to accept a  gross  body  and
having qualified themselves for liberation  are  eligible  to  come  to  the
eternal spiritual realms of Lord Krishna which is the ultimate  reality  and
revels in bliss with Him.
