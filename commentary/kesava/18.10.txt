Lord Krishna explains that the aspirant who is  imbued  and  saturated  with
<i>sattva guna</i> the  mode  of  goodness  has  achieved  spiritual  knowledge  by
renunciation and possess discrimination regarding  spirit  and  matter.  The
word <i>medhavi</i> means superior intelligence,  which  bequeathes  upon  one  the
faculty of retentive  focus  which  gives  the  ability  to  comprehend  the
ultimate truth through any experience. Such a one neither abhors that  which
is undesirable nor seeks that which is desirable. Such a one does not  avoid
prescribed Vedic activities because  they  may  cause  discomfort  such  as:
predawn bath daily in the cold of winter or  following  <i>ekadasi</i>  by  fasting
from all grains on the 11th day of the waxing and waning moons  and  staying
up all night chanting sacred incantations and meditating, etc.  Such  a  one
never gets attached to that which gives comfort and a sense  of  well  being
such  as  eating  rich  vegetarian  foods,  enjoying  the  pleasantness   of
beautiful environments, etc. The purport is that such a one is  prepared  to
undergo comfort or  discomfort  in  executing  prescribed  Vedic  activities
without attachment.
