It could possibly be accepted what Arjuna has  stated  regarding  others  on
the battlefield; but for the wicked sons of Dhritarastra led  by  Duryodhana
who have tried to  harm  the  Pandavas  in  various  ways  should  be  slain
immediately. In Vedic scriptures six aggressors may be rightfully  slain  at
anytime. One who administers poison, one who commits arson, one who  attacks
with deadly weapons, one who steals wealth, one who usurps property and  one
who kidnaps a wife. The sons of Dhritarastra have  committed  these  heinous
acts of  aggression  against  the  Pandavas.  The  word  <i>atatayinah</i>  meaning
aggressors can also be applied as criminals and  such  criminals  committing
any of the  six  aggressions  can  be  rightfully  slain.  So  the  sons  of
Dhritarastra  should be slain without any hesitation or compunction; but  in
rebuttal Arjuna is saying that sin would be accrued and hell  would  be  the
punishment as a result of slaying one's relatives.  Their is  no  reward  in
this world or the next for such an action; therefore it  would  be  improper
to execute this.  The  word  <i>hi</i>  means  certainly  and  this  augments  this
assertion. By addressing Lord Krishna with the vocative <i>Madhava</i> meaning  the
husband of the goddess of fortune indicates that as the husband  He  is  the
progenitor of the family not the destroyer of the  family  and  that  Arjuna
should also not act contrarily to this.
