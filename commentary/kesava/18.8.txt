Here Lord Krishna speaks of the renunciation characterised by <i>raja  guna</i>  or
mode of passion. The phrase <i>dukham eva</i> can  mean  troublesome.  One  who  is
unhappy about executing their obligations and forsakes their duties  due  to
discomfort or else performs  them  reluctantly  with  minimal  exertion  and
effort will acquire no benefit or reap any reward for their endeavors.  They
are known to be situated in <i>raga guna</i>  and  such  renunciation  will  bestow
neither spirirtual knowledge nor advancement in spiritual life.
