At the conclusion of  chapter  seven  Lord  Krishna  introduced  terms  like
<i>adhibhuta</i> identifying with the material  substratum,  <i>adhiyatma</i>  identifying
with embodied beings and <i>adhidaivas</i> identifying  with  the  demigods.  These
subjects are essential and must be well  comprehended  by  an  aspirant  who
seeks to become a qualified devotee  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  They  will  be
further elucidated in  detail  in  this  chapter.  Since  Lord  Krishna  had
introduced these terms only briefly, Arjuna was curious to learn more  about
theses terms and how they relate to the Supreme Lord as well as  to  himself
and so he raises seven queries in the first two verses. He  wanted  to  know
such things like if the term <i>adhidaivam</i> referred specifically to  <i>Indra</i>  the
celestial chief or did it applied equally to all the demigods and also  what
exactly is included in <i>adhibhutas.</i>
