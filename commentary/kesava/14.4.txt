It is not that the origins of all <i>jivas</i> or  embodied  beings  manifest  only
after the cyclic dissolution of creation; but also all subsequent  creations
they are all completely dependent upon the Supreme Lord  Krishna  for  their
existence. This is what is denoted by the words <i>sarva yonisu</i>    meaning  all
species of life  that  <i>jivas</i>  inhabit  be  they  demigods,  human,  animals,
demons, birds, fish, ghosts, spirits, etc. The  original  conceiving  mother
is <i>prakriti</i> or the  material  substratum  pervading  physical  existence  in
combination with the Supreme Lord Krishna  as  the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul
generating father which is like unto a seed in every  respect.  The  purport
is  that  insentient  <i>prakriti</i>  can  never  act   independently   but   only
subordinate and in conjunction with the Supreme Lord and the <i>jivas</i> are  then
manifested according to their <i>karma</i> or reactions to past actions.
