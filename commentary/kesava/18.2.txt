Lord  Krishna  explains  that  some  learned  men  of   knowledge   propound
renunciation  as  <i>sannyasa</i>  or  abandoning  all  activities  prescribed   or
otherwise motivated by  desire  for  rewards.  While  other  men  of  wisdom
maintain that renunciation is <i>tyaja</i> or abandoning  the  desire  for  rewards
and not relinquishing the prescribed Vedic activitiy.
