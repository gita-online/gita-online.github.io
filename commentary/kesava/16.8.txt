Lord Krishna further  clarifies  that  the  demoniac  harbouring  insatiable
lusts and desires  invent  false  doctrines  to  corroborate  their  heinous
activities fostered by vile and diabolical vows of  deranged  depravity.  At
inauspicious  times  such  as  midnight   and   during   thunderstorms,   on
inauspicious days such as new moon and eclipses and at  inauspicious  places
such as crematoriums and cemeteries; the demoniac exuding evil and  full  of
impurity,    hypocrisy,    deviousness,    belligerence,    arrogance    and
pretentiousness offer blood of animals and even humans in  their  diabolical
worship of disincarnate ghosts, spirits, hobgoblins and demons.
