Among the four Vedas,  Lord  Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine,  transcendental
opulence is found in the Sama Veda which excels the others by the  sweetness
of its melody. Among the demigods His <i>vibhuti</i> is Indra, the celestial  chief
of all the demigods. Among the 11 organs of perception His <i>vibhuti</i> the  mind
is master of them all and He is the <i>cetana</i> or consciousness  in  all  living
beings.
