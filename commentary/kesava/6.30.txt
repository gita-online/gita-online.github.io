Then Lord Krishna responding to Arjuna's  queries  concurs  that  without  a
doubt the mind is extremely difficult to control and similar to confining  a
cyclone in a pot; but Arjuna should shake off his trepidation and  make  the
effort, for the mind can be brought under control by the  repeated  practice
of meditation. One should first withdraw the  mind  from  the  influence  of
sense objects and then focus the mind in  concentration  internally  on  the
<i>atma</i> or soul. By practising indifference towards sense  objects,  dispassion
will arise in the senses and the mind will show no  interest  and  will  not
gravitate to anything else other than the  <i>atma.</i>  This  is  accomplished  by
reflecting on the transient nature of  anything  other  than  the  <i>atma</i>  and
contemplating on the inherent defects  in  such  transient  objectives.  The
vocative words <i>maha-bahu</i> meaning mighty armed one  indicates  in  a  general
sense that only a superior person trained in such practice  will  meet  with
success whereas a normal person will not be able to. In the  specific  sense
<i>maha-bahu</i> means one whose arms are mighty enough to control an enemy  should
be mighty enough to control the enemy  knows  as  the  turbulent  mind.  The
particle <i>tu</i> meaning but denotes there should be no lethargy in effort.
