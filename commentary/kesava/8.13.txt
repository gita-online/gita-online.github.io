One who chants the sacred syllable <i>OM</i> which is the personal sound  vibration
of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  which  expresses  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  the
spiritual substratum pervading all existence, constantly meditating on  Lord
Krishna who is the full  absolute  aspect  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  and  who  while
vacating their physical body at the moment  of  death  departs  through  the
<i>sushanna</i> channel situated in the crown of  the  head  reaches  according  to
qualification and gradation of one's lifetime practice, attains the  eternal
spiritual plane described in the Vedic scriptures known as the Upanisads.
