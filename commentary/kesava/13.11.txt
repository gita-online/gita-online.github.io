Although appearing to be <i>vibhaktam</i> or divided  it  is  factually  <i>avibhaktam</i>
undivided but very difficult to discern and be recognised. It  is  the  sole
object worthy of knowing and appears  as  unlimited  forms  as  if  it  were
divided. Yet for those who are spiritually  enlightened  and  have  realised
<i>atma-tattva</i> knowledge of the immortal soul they can comprehend this  mystery
of Lord Krishna known as <i>Parabrahma</i> who is the  source  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or
spiritual substratum pervading all existence and which is the sustainer  and
nourisher of all living beings and is known as the <i>ksetra-jna</i> the knower  of
all fields of activity. The Chandogya Upanisad VII.XXVI.II  beginning  <i>tasta</i>
<i>ha va  etasyaivam  pashyata</i>  states:  One  who  perceives,  comprehends  and
realises the ontology of the Supreme Lord Krishna knows very well the  <i>atma.</i>
