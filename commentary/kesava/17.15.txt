Lord Krishna now describes austerities characterised by <i>raja guna</i>  the  mode
of  passion.  Austerities  that  are  enacted  for  the  sake   of   gaining
recognition and garnering praise and respect from others, that  are  enacted
to receive adulation and adoration and whose enactment is  ostentatious  and
pretentious are situated in <i>raja  guna</i>  and  whatever  results  derived  are
uncertain, unstable and temporary.
