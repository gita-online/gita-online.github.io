The question may be asked that if the path of <i>karma yoga</i> or prescibed  Vedic
activities  without  desiring  rewards  is  anyway  realised   through   the
renunciation of action then why not start with  renunciation  of  action  in
the beginning. To alleviate this doubt Lord  Krishna  replies  that  without
<i>karma yoga</i> it is impossible to achieve purity of mind and in the absence  of
a pure mind it is  very  difficult  and  even  perilous  as  the  chance  of
disturbance and agitation are prevalent. Whereas the purified  mind  of  the
<i>munir</i> or elevated sage endowed with  equanimity  who  practices  <i>karma  yoga</i>
very soon perceives  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence and achieves <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul as well.
