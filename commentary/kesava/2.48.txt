One performing actions with  the  thought  of  receiving  rewards  gets  the
desired resultant. This appears positive but  it  is  repeatedly  denounced.
Why? Because actions performed  due  to  selfish  motives  are  inferior  to
actions performed due to selfless motives. Selfless motives are balanced  in
equanimity. Equanimity possesses a  determinate  consciousness.  Because  of
this reality one should seek the shelter of evenness of mind in  equanimity.
Arjuna had acquired so many riches before naturally following  his  duty  so
why should he try to avoid his  duty  worrying  about  success  or  failure.
Those motivated to perform activities craving  only  to  get  a  reward  for
their actions are inferior and wretched.
