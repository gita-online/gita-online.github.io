The essence of  this  instruction  by  Lord  Krishna  is  to  surrender  all
prescribed Vedic actions and duties to Him  without  considering  merits  or
demerits. Actual devotion is full faith and loving devotion in  the  Supreme
Lord. Dedicating oneself completely and all that one has  unto  the  Supreme
Lord in a continuous flow like the perpetual and powerful flow of the  river
Ganga fully satisfies and please the Supreme Lord. This is the most  natural
and effacious duty for all living entities  to  simply  surrender  all  that
they are, all that they have to their creator,  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
All actions  that  follow  the  injunctions  and  ordinances  of  the  Vedic
scriptures are propitiation and worship of the Supreme Lord; but  to  follow
His direct instruction which is the conclusion of all the  Vedic  scriptures
is the highest and most exalted form of devotion. As is confirmed  in  Katha
Upanisad I.II.XXII beginning  <i>nayam  atma  pravacanena</i>  meaning:   Communion
with the Supreme Lord is obtained  only  by  those  who  the   Supreme  Lord
Himself chooses out of His own perogative. It is without question that  such
an exalted one can only be a devotee of the  Supreme  Lord  for  none  other
then His devotees are dearer to  Him  in  the  worlds  as  given  in  Skanda
Purana,  Reva-khanda.   So  it  is  adequately  established  with   evidence
thoughout Srimad Bhagavad-Gita from a multitude  of  Vedic  scriptures  that
<i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion unto the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  the
highest attainment and prime goal for all living entities.
