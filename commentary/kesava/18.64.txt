One who establishes a forum for Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  giving  the  text  as
well  as  elaborate  explanations  of  the  meaning  doing  this   for   the
enlightenment of the devotees and not to  receive  honor  or  prestige;  but
only to please the Supreme Lord.  Such  a  devotee  who  does  this  service
disseminating this knowledge to the devotees is  serving  the  interests  of
Lord Krishna fully and will surely attain His communion. The  mentioning  of
the word <i>bhaktesu</i> means  Lord  Krishna's  devotees  denoting  that  only  by
exclusive devotional service is one chosen to reside in  the  Supreme  Lords
eternal <i>dhama</i> or abode. The Katha  Upanisad  II.XXII  beginning  <i>nayam  atma</i>
<i>pravachanena</i> meaning: That devotee whom the Supreme Lord chooses by His  own
sweet will is the one who will  attain  Him.   So  it  is  established  that
loving devotion is what is essential to recive the Supreme Lords grace  even
with the absence of austerities and such a devotee is qualified to  approach
the Supreme Lord based on <i>bhakti</i> alone. So devotion is  established  as  the
only essential ingredient to attract the attention of the Supreme Lord.  The
understanding  is  that  although  determination   and   ritualistic   Vedic
knowledge are noteworthy and exemplary they only  bestow  residence  in  the
transitory heavenly planets and never the eternal spirirtual realms  because
they do not have the potency to attract the Supreme Lord whose devotees  are
not subjected to results of a temporary nature but to results of an  eternal
nature. That is the difference in devotion and empirical knowledge.
