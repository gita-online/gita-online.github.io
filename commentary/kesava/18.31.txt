Now the influence on <i>buddhi</i> or intellect of one situated  in  <i>tama  guna</i>  or
mode of ignorance is described by Lord  Krishna.  That  intellect  which  is
enveloped in  ignorance  and  warped  by  distortion.  Which  considers  the
highest reality as an insignificant  entity.  Who  understands  the  Supreme
absolute truth to be lower than an  abstract,  impersonal  conception.  That
considers the conditioned <i>jiva</i> to be erqual to the Supreme Lord. To  imagine
the Supreme Lord who ioverflowing with all divine qualities, attributes  and
potencies to be on the same platform as  all  other  gods.  Who  negate  the
eternal and imperishable Vedic scriptures  for  some  impermanent,  temporal
religious texts applicable for limited time. Who cannot tell  what  is  real
in this world and who thinks what  is  unreal  is  real.Who  are  unable  to
fathom that the Supreme Lord in one with and  different  from  His  creation
simulataneously. Such a one is unavoidably situated in <i>tama guna.</i>
