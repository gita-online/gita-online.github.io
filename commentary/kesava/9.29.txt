The doubt may arise that if  the  Supreme  Lord  only  guides  His  devotees
towards <i>atma-tattva</i> or soul realisation and shuns  those  who  are  not  His
devotee then He is influenced by attraction and repulsion  also  and  cannot
be justified to be the impartial Supreme  Lord  of  all.  To  mitigate  this
doubt Lord Krishna states <i>samo'ham sarva-bhutesu</i> meaning He is equal to  all
beings, due to the fact that He is <i>paramatma</i> or the  Supreme  Soul  residing
within all beings which includes divine beings, humans, animal, plant,  bird
and fish each characterised with  the  innate  qualities  of  their  species
graded by best, normal and mediocre none being  more  disagreeable  or  more
agreeable to Him. Whenever <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion is offered to Him  from
whatever level of society He accepts. He is not degraded  if  worshipped  by
one  from  the  lowest  position  of  society  neither  is  He  upgraded  if
worshipped by one from  the  highest  position  in  society.  Such  external
considerations are not of importance. Whoever worships Him with <i>bhakti</i>  from
any class be it high or low He reciprocates in communion with them and  they
are never seperated from  Him.  Just  like  Gajendra  who  was  an  only  an
elephant prayed to the Supreme Lord and was rescued by Him. The  Sabari  who
were simple forest women who seeing His footprints  in  the  forest  smeared
the dust from them on their bodies and experienced bliss.  Guha  the  tribal
king who rendered service to Rama and became His friend.  The  hero  Hanuman
who although a monkey was able to  aid  Rama  in  finding  Sita  and  became
endeared to Him eternally.  All  these  were  lowly  class  yet  they  still
received the Supreme Lords sublime  mercy.  Contrarily  Bhishma,  Srutadeva,
Bahulasva,  the  Pandavas  being  Yudhisthira,  Bhima,  Arjuna,  Nakula  and
Sahadeva all belonged to the highest class and being devoted to the  Supreme
Lord received His sublime mercy.

The Supreme Lord Krishna blesses His devotees equally  regardless  of  class
or position but to the envious like Duryodhana  and  the  non-believers  who
are not His devotees He is neutral and they do not  receive  His  blessings.
So there is no partiality and contingency of inequality on the part  of  the
Supreme Lord. As fire gives heat and light to whoever comes near to  it,  as
wish fulfilling trees fulfil the desires of whoever sits  beneath  them  and
neither are liable to partiality or inequality to those who do not  approach
them. In the same  way  the  Supreme  Lord's  extending  His  grace  to  His
devotees who have approached Him does not exemplify  partiality.  In  Srimad
Bhagavatam X.LXXII.VI it is declared by Emperor Yudhisthira  that:  As  Lord
Krishna is the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all existence,  the
absolute truth, <i>paramatma</i> the supreme soul within all sentient  beings,  who
experiences self bliss and beholds all with an equal eye; with Him there  is
no difference of feeling  between  one  form  and  another.  Just  like  the
heavenly desire trees, He blesses all  who  properly  worship  Him  granting
their desired rewards according to the service they render unto  Him.  There
is no contradiction in doing this.
