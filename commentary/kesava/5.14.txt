Lord Krishna begins stating <i>nadatte kasyacit papam</i>  meaning  that  He  never
accepts the sins of any being. He also never accepts the piety of any  being
either. So He is not connected to any merit or demerit  they  may  incur  by
their actions. But as the energising principle  of  all  creation  naturally
all beings are impelled according to  their  own  natures  by  Him.  If  the
Supreme Lord, the impeller of all beings is not  involved  in  the  doership
and activities of the embodied beings and He is not a recipient  of  any  of
their merits and demerits then  why  is  it  that  embodied  beings  perform
actions that bind them to material existence. The word <i>jnanam</i>  or  knowledge
denoting cognisance is used here. One's  natural  cognisance  and  spiritual
discrimination is enveloped in ignorance since time immemorial  and  so  the
embodied  being  is  infatuated  by  delusion.  Hence  they  perform  sinful
activities  believing  them  to  be  good  and  when  they  receive   severe
repercussions as  reactions  for  such  sinful  activities  they  blame  the
Supreme Lord for injustice or for being partial and by making offences  they
sink further into nescience.
