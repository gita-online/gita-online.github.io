Those of demoniac nature includes devils and demons. What  is  <i>privritti</i>  or
right actions such <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings cannot comprehend. Hence out  of
the four goals of life they are only able to  achieve  two:  <i>kama</i>  which  is
lust for sense gratification  and  <i>artha</i>  which  is  greed  for  wealth  and
positions of great power. But they are unable to  achieve  <i>dharma</i>  which  is
righteous propriety and without <i>dharma</i> it is impossible to attain  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence. This is because the demoniac are  unable
to understand <i>nivritti</i> which is the cessation  of  material  activities  for
the benefit of spiritual  activities  and  such  renunciation  is  the  path
leading to <i>moksa.</i> As the  demoniac  do  not  possess  purity  internally  or
externally they are never qualified to perform spiritual activities  and  so
the demoniac resort to diabolically,  degraded  activities  with  discarnate
ghosts, spirits and demons involving blood  sacrifices,  torture  and  death
which do not depend upon inner and outer purity to  receive  their  decadent
results. Contrarily those of the divine nature have no desire to  enjoy  the
results of worship because it is offered for  the  sublime  satisfaction  of
the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorised incarnations  as  revealed
in Vedic scriptures and is a pure offering  of  devotion  to  Him.  But  the
demoniac  conduct  their  depraved,  diabolical   rituals   explicitly   for
physical, personal and material gain for themselves and the resultant  <i>karma</i>
or the corresponding reactions to previous actions  sinks  them  deeper  and
deeper into lower and lower  degraded  forms  of  material  existence  birth
after birth.
<p>
The demoniac are completely oblivious to the  knowledge  which  would  frees
them from the enslavement of <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and  death
due to ignorance of  spiritual knowledge that lead to  <i>moksa.</i>  The  demoniac
are vile, impure, perverse, cruel,  diabolical,  untruthful,  untrustworthy,
bereft of all righteousness and evil. Those <i>jivas</i> possessing such  qualities
are to be known irrefutably as demons.
