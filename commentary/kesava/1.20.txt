It could be asked of Arjuna, doesn't  he  already  know  the  worth  of  his
opponents on the battlefield? Certainly Arjuna is  fully  cognizant  of  the
worthiness of Bhishma and Drona as case in point as well as so many  others.
But in this verse this objection would be clarified by Arjuna's  reply  that
he wishes to see all those who are favouring  the  evil  minded  Duryodhana,
the son of Dhritarastra.
