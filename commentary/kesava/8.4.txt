In this verse  Lord  Krishna  answers  three  questions.  He  confirms  that
<i>adhibhuta</i> is all perishable objects existing  of  the  material  substratum,
specific transformations like ether,  the  manifestations  of  sound,  light
etc. as well as every other element<i>.</i>  He  further  reveals  that  the  total
aggregate of all embodied <i>atmas</i> or souls as  well  as  the  presiding  deity
over all <i>atmas</i> who is Brahma the  first  embodied  being  and  the  foremost
creator of embodied beings are all <i>adhidaiva</i>. This includes the demigods  in
charge of universal management such as Surya in charge of the sun,  Vayu  in
charge of wind, Varuna in charge of water, etc.   Referring  to  the  person
who performs the <i>yagna</i> or propitiation and worship,  Lord  Krishna   is  the
<i>adhiyagna</i> the propagator of all action and the  ultimate  recipient  of  all
offerings. Any offerings performed in the  world  are  accomplished  by  the
help of one's body wherein resides the Supreme Lord as the eternal <i>atma</i>  and
indwelling monitor. Thus the Supreme Lord is presiding  over  the  performer
of <i>yagna</i> because being dependent they are supported  and  sustained  by  Him
and thus <i>yagna</i> should always be  performed  in  propitiation  to  Him.  Lord
Krishna is the presiding deity of all <i>yagna.</i> He is the bestower  of  rewards
for all actions and the enjoyer of the rewards  of  all  sacrifices.  He  is
residing in the bodies as the inner witness of all  the  demigods  as  well,
who are  the  individual  deities  presiding  over  general  and  occasional
<i>yagnas.</i> In this  way  Lord  Krishna  has  delineated  the  terms  <i>adhibhuta,</i>
<i>adhidaiva</i> and <i>adhiyagna,</i> explaing  them  comprehensively  for  the  sake  of
imparting knowledge so those who earnestly aspire can achieve  the  ultimate
destination.
