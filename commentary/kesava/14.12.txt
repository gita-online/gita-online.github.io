Now Lord Krishna speaks of the indications of the qualities of <i>raja guna</i>  or
the mode of passion. Underlying the preponderance of passion  is  <i>lobhah</i>  or
greed wwhich is the desire to always acquire more even if  not  needed.  The
motivating force is activity for increasing self interests.   The  mentality
is after I acquire this, I will acquire that and so forth and so  on.  There
is an incessant impulse to do  and an obsession to enjoy  every  object.  So
by <i>lobhah</i> it can be understood that one is controlled by <i>raja guna.</i>
