Lord Krishna refutes the impersonalistic <i>sankhya</i>  philosophy  which  negates
the existence of  the  Supreme  Lord  by  propounding  the  combination  and
essential dependence of the <i>ksetra</i> or field of activity with the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>
or the knower of the field of activity. He delineates all  aspects  such  as
what the qualities are. How they can be recognised. How they keep the  <i>jivas</i>
or embodied beings in bondage and how this is established  and  enforced  by
contact and attraction to sense objects and material nature. He states  that
the three <i>gunas</i> or  qualities  of  <i>sattva,  rajas</i>  and  <i>tamas</i>  or  goodness,
passion and ignorance respectively are  not  the  actual  forms  of  objects
seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched but are the status of  the  inherent
attributes contained as. Thus <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum  pervading
physical existence is defined as the resting place  where  the  three  <i>gunas</i>
are equipoise and arise from.  This  same  <i>prakriti</i>  when  agitated  by  the
Supreme  Lord's  onslaught  of  time  transforms  into   <i>mahat</i>   or   cosmic
intelligence and firmly becomes bonded with the dualities such  as  pleasure
and pain, happiness and distress, etc. But then one may question why  it  is
stated in chapter 2, verse 30 that the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul  can  never  be
destroyed. Anticipating such a query Lord Krishna states the  words  <i>dehinam</i>
<i>avyayam</i> meaning the immutable spirit soul denoting that  although  the  <i>atma</i>
resides in the physical body it is immutable and never  changes  it  quality
of eternality. So the <i>gunas</i> cause the <i>atma</i> to be imprisoned by the  physical
body due to its attachment to the body and its attraction to the senses  and
its desire for sense objects. The Visnu  Purana  states:  The  Supreme  Lord
enters by His own will with equipoise  into  mutable  matter  and  immutable
spirit, activating both at the time of creation.  O  sage  He  is  both  the
activator and the activated. By way of contraction and expansion  He  abides
equipoise within <i>prakriti</i> as the  <i>ksetrajna</i>  from  whence  the  three  <i>gunas</i>
arise  which  control  the  <i>ksetra.</i>  This  irrevocably  manifests   at   the
commencement of creation. So in conclusion the three <i>gunas</i> are the  modified
essence of <i>prakriti</i> which is  generated  by  the  <i>mahat</i>  unto  all  material
beings and planets such as Earth and others.
