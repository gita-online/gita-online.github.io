Up until this verse Lord Krishna presented the point  of  view
that prescribed Vedic activities will not incur any  fault  if
performed in yagna or worship in  dedication  to  the  Supreme
Lord. This is because the doership of all souls are  dependant
solely on the Supreme Being as is  confirmed  in  hundreds  of
scriptural verses from the Vedic scriptures such as: He is the
soul of all. He the controller of all has entered inside  each
of them. He verily causes those to perform great works whom He
intends to liberate from this world. Such passages  are  found
in the Brhandaranyaka Upanisad and others.  Now  Lord  Krishna
points out the  virtues  in  those  who  follow  the  pristine
teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita accepting them as perfect  with
full faith without finding fault in performing actions without
desires  and  attachment  or  blaspheming   the   speaker   by
critcising the idea  of   performing  actions  free  from  ego
consciousness or speculating how can it be  possible  that  by
performing these instructions one becomes free from bondage of
all actions and the cycle of birth and  death.  The  teachings
and instructions of Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita are  the
essence and conclusion of all Vedic Scriptures and  are  given
for the highest benefit of all mankind.
