It may be wondered that  if  the  great  sages,  liberated  beings  and  the
demigods are unable to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine
universal form. How will it be possible for Arjuna to see such a form.  This
is why Arjuna states the words <i>manyase yada</i> which means if you consider.  If
Lord Krishna considers  that  Arjuna  who  is  His  surrendered  devotee  is
capable  of  beholding  His  universal  form  which  encompasses  the  total
creation then by the Supreme Lord's grace He can reveal it. Lord Krishna  is
addressed by him as <i>Yogesvara</i> or the lord of yogis perfected in the  science
of the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the  ultimate
consciousness. By the Supreme Lord's grace one can achieve the path  leading
to spiritual perfection which is one's highest good and without the  Supreme
Lord's grace no path is capable of yielding spiritual perfection. Arjuna  is
inferring that due to being fully devoted to Lord  Krishna  he  can  witness
this supreme form.
