In order to  conclusively  establish  the  evidence  and  justification  for
abandoning all demoniac vices and evils by permanently avoiding lust,  greed
and anger which so forcefully takes  one  directly  to  hell;  Lord  Krishna
irrevocably reveals the reason. Any <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  in  a  physical
body or subtle body, who whimsically ignores the  ordinances  of  the  Vedic
scriptures  or  who  foolishly  disregards  the  injunctions  of  the  Vedic
scriptures and instead  transgresses  the  prohibitions  prescribed  therein
that are for the welfare and benefit of all creation; can never achieve  any
good for  themselves  or  any  good  for  others.  Such  foolish  miscreants
obstruct all possibilities for their own best interests  and  ostracize  all
their opportunities for spiritual  advancement.  Those  who  transgress  the
Vedic scriptures and are slaves to their  senses,  controlled  by  the  base
urges of the physical body, and who indiscriminately follow every desire  of
the mind; will never achieve perfection, happiness or the ultimate  goal  of
existence even if one strives for that for millions of  lifetimes.  The  use
of the relative pronoun <i>yah</i> meaning he who symbolises the <i>jivas</i>  in  general
who are qualifed enough for this  to  apply  to.  The  word  <i>sastra</i>  applies
exclusively to the Vedic  scriptures  and  is  explained  etymologically  as
eternal and universal instructions for the benefit  of  all  creation.  This
includes the four Vedas, Vedanta Sutra, Srimad Bhagavatam, the Puranas,  the
Upanisads, the Itithasas  along  with  their  auxiliaries  and  Mahabharata,
Ramayana, Sri Caitanya Caritamrita, etc. which are all  under  the  pantheon
of the Vedic scriptures
<p>
The injunctions of the Vedic scriptures are  in  the  form  of:  One  should
perform this. The prohibitions of the Vedic scriptures is in  the  form  of:
One should not perform that. An  example  of  an  injunction  is  that:  One
should perform <i>ahimsa</i> which is not causing  harm  to  any  living  being  by
thought, word or action. An example of a prohibition  is  that:  One  should
not eat grains on <i>Ekadasi</i> the 11th day of the waxing  and  waning  moon.  An
example of an injunction and a prohibition is that: Cows are inviolable  and
should never be killed. The inference of the word  should  is  derived  from
the usage of the verb in the potential mood.
