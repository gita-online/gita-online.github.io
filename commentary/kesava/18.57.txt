Before Lord Krishna spoke of doership as dependent upon material nature  and
the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature that one is endowed  with.  This
was in line with the <i>samkhya</i> philosophy  of  analytical  reasoning.  Now  He
confirms that all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings are under the  total  control  of
the Supreme Lord based upon the Vedic scriptures.  The  Taittiriya  Upanisad
III.IX.II beginning <i>sa yascayam purushe</i> states: The  Supreme  Lord  residing
on that plane ot  transcendent  eternity  is  the  same  Supreme  Lord  that
resides within the core of the  etheric  heart  of  all  <i>jivas</i>  o  embiodied
beings.  The  Brihadaranyaka  Upanisad  III.VIII.IX  beginning   <i>etasya   va</i>
<i>aksharasya</i> states: Verily by the Supreme Lords  command  the  sun  and  moon
maintain their fixed positions, the heavens and Earth keep  ther  respective
position, the seconds, minutes,  hours,  days,  nights,  weeks,  months  and
years all maintain their relative posions. The Supreme Lord is the  ultimate
controller of everything  animate and inanimate which are acting  under  His
external  energy  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum   pervading   physical
existence from whence arise three <i>gunas</i> or modes of  material  nature  which
determines all actions based upon the <i>karma</i> or reactions  to  previous  good
and evil actions enacted in  a  physical  body  and  five  senses  which  is
likened unto a machine.  The  purport  is  that  just  as  a  puppet  master
controls his puppets so does the Supreme Lord control the <i>jivas.</i>
