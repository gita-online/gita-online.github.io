It may be questioned how can Arjuna abandon his duty to fight as a  ksatriya
which is prescribed in the Vedic scriptures and believe that  begging  which
is one of the duties of a brahmana is better?  To  counter  this  Arjuna  is
stating that he does not know which one is better or if its even  better  to
be victorious or be vanquished as victory itself could seem like defeat  for
by being forced into the situation of having to slay his  relatives  in  the
Kaurava army he would not wish to live any longer.
