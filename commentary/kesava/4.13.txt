If not everyone worships Lord Krishna and so many  more  are  worshipers  of
other religions  and denominations then why is this unbalance  so  prevalent
in  society.  This  verse  refers  to  the  four  orders  of  Vedic  culture
exclusively being the <i>brahmins</i> or priestly  class,  the  <i>ksatriya's</i>  or  the
royal and warrior class, the <i>vaisya's</i> or farming and trading class  and  the
<i>sudra</i> or the servant classs. These were created  according  to  the  natural
qualities of their prenatal disposition and classified accordingly to  their
corresponding birth. The Brahmins have the prenatal  quality  of  <i>sattva</i>  or
goodness, the <i>ksatriya's</i> have the prenatal  quality  of   <i>rajas</i>  or  passion
being dominant and <i>sattva</i> being subordinate, the <i>vaisya's</i> have the  prenatal
quality of <i>tama guna</i> or ignorance  with  <i>rajas</i>  being  subordinate  and  the
<i>sudras</i> have the prenatal quality  of  ignorance.  Any  other  classification
outside of these four cannot be claimed to be originated  by  Lord  Krishna.
Although Lord Krishna is the originator of these four orders He  is  not  to
be held accountable to the unbalance in  society  as  this  is  due  to  the
prenatal disposition of all beings based on their activities and  subsequent
reactions each life.
