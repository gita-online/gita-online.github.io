One might wonder that just as crossing the ocean by boat  does  not  destroy
the ocean how is it that the boat of spiritual  knowledge  can  destroy  all
one's sins. Lord Krishna states here that the boat  of  spiritual  knowledge
will destroy all reactions to actions both those leading to merit and  those
leading to demerit.
