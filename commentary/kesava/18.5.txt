Lord Krishna reveals His absolute conclusion  by  declaring  that  under  no
circumstances should prescribed Vedic activities be  terminated.  Activities
such as <i>yagna</i> or  ritualistic  propitiation  and  worship,  <i>tapah</i>  or  Vedic
austerities and penance as  well  as  <i>danam</i>  or  charity  to  Vaisnavas  and
Brahmins are sanctifying and purifying. They have been  established  at  the
beginning of creation  to benefit all living entities and they  elevate  the
minds of those aspirants who contemplate and meditate on the Supreme Lord.
