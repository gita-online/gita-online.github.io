The transcendental evocation OM TAT SAT denotes  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
through His abstract auxiliary potency the <i>brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence and is all auspiciousness. Due to  this  interaction
the recitation of OM TAT SAT by duly initiated Vaisnavas  and  brahmanas  at
the commencement of all Vedic rites insures success and  is  ascertained  as
the cause of accomplishing  all  Vedic  rituals  successfully  causing  well
being and attainment to the Vaisnavas and  brahmanas  who  are  the  topmost
members of creation. Now in order to delineate the proper  actions  involved
with each for achieving the  desired  goal,  Lord  Krishna  begins  with  OM
explaining that it is a name for  the  <i>brahman</i>  and  is  a  potency  of  the
Supreme Lord as it is connected  to  the  prime  source  of  all  the  Vedic
scriptures. Therefore by vibrating the  transcendental  <i>pranava</i>  OM  at  the
commencement  of  any  prescribed  Vedic  activity  without  any  pause   or
digression stabilises the  continuity  and  connection  insuring  successful
accomplishment of  <i>yagna</i>  or  propitiation  and  worship  by  Vaisnavas  and
brahmanas, <i>tapah</i> or austerities by the <i>ksatriyas</i> or royal warrior class  and
<i>danam</i> or charity by the <i>vaisyas</i> or merchant class.
