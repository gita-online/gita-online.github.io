Everyone can understand that the mind is restless and fickle  by  the  proof
of observing one's own mind. The  mind  is  turbulent  in  its  actions  and
tenacious in its selections. It is extremely difficult  to  control  because
it is strongly bound to desire for habituated  sense  gratification.  It  is
also powerful and hard to withdraw once it is  out  in  pursuit  of  desired
sense objects.  Considering  all  these  things  Arjuna  expresses  to  Lord
Krishna that trying to control the mind is like trying to control the  wind.
It is like trying to confine a violently blowing cyclone in a pot. By  using
the vocative case O' Lord Krishna denotes that Lord Krishna who removes  the
illusion  of  His  devotees  should  also  remove  all  delusions  regarding
controlling the mind.
