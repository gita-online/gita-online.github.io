In this way after presenting the distictions between  one  who
is spiritually wise in  Vedic  knowledge  and  those  who  are
acting in ignorance; Lord Krishna gives the sober caution  not
to  unsettle  the  minds  of  the  ignorant,  for  they  being
completely infatuated  by  prakriti  or  material  nature  are
totally attached to all their  actions  thinking  always  that
they are  performing  a  particular  action  for  the  express
purpose of being able to enjoy a particular delight.  They are
unable to perform actions as a matter of duty without desiring
rewards. So  the  spiritually  wise  should  not  deviate  the
ignorant from their duties even if these duties are completely
fruitive without any spiritual benefit because at  least  they
are performing actions and administering superior knowledge to
them may cause them to refrain from their  duties  altogether.
Eventually in the course of their lifetime  there  will  be  a
glimmer of comprehension of the utter futility for  attachment
for such actions.
