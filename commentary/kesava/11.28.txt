Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal  form  was  very  agreeable  to
devour all the warriors lapping them up  completely  like  a  lion  laps  up
water and swallowing these  warriors  with  His  innumerable  fiery  mouths.
Kings like Duryodhana were rushing into these  mouths  from  all  directions
and the <i>visvarupa's</i> fierce and terrible splendour is torture to  the  entire
creation who is being seared and scorched by its blazing effulgence.
