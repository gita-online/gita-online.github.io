In the normal course of events actions and merits have a finish at  the  end
of ones lifetime. The actions have  a  conclusion  in  this  world  and  the
merits have a conclusion in the next world. It is likened  as  to  a  farmer
tilling his crops, by industrious action the merits of an  abundant  harvest
are assured. But if he is to omit any of  the  steps  such  as  watering  or
pruning within the process the harvest is put into jeopardy.  Similarly  the
demerit of non-comittance by Arjuna is also possible if any  action  of  his
duty is not performed. In this regard then by only acting  without  fruitive
desires does not guarantee freedom from  the  shackles  of  bondage  in  the
material existence. But here Lord Krishna explains in bhakti-yoga  which  is
His exclusive loving  devotional  service  there  is  an  exemption  to  the
aforementioned rule and that there is never any loss or dimunition to  those
who are fortunate enough to perform bhakti-yoga  in  this  lifetime  or  any
lifetime. Unlike the  cultivation  of  farming  which  is  always  beset  by
problems of weather, drought, blight and numerous  unexpected  difficulties.
In bhakti-yoga there is no chance of contrary results or  fear  of  demerits
in committance or non-committance when carrying out devotional  service  for
the ultimate satisfaction of the Supreme  Lord.  Hence  even  the  slightest
effort in the cultivation of bhakti-yoga which is without  fruitive  desires
and  which  is  also  known  as  acting  selflessly  assures  one   complete
protection and inevitably saves one  from  transmigration  and  the  endless
cycle of birth and death in the material existence.
