In this way after establishing the immortality of  the  soul,  Lord  Krishna
informs Arjuna that for anyone to believe that it is possible for  the  soul
to be slain or anyone  believing  that  they  can  be  responsible  for  the
slaying of the soul, are both in  complete  ignorance.  Not  being  able  to
fathom the intrinsic nature of the soul they cannot realize  that  the  soul
is never the instigator of any action nor is the soul ever the recepient  of
any action.
