Thus Lord Krishna described the final departure of  the  body  by  a  normal
aspirant at the time of  death.  Now  He  will  discourse  about  the  final
departure of the <i>yogi</i> or one perfected in  the  science  of  the  individual
consciousness attaining communion with the ultimate  consciousness,  who  is
His exclusive devotee. He asserts this with the words <i>ananya-cetasa</i>  meaning
with fixed consciousness. What does this mean? It means undivided  attention
to the <i>rupa</i> or form, <i>guna</i>  or  qualities,  <i>lilas</i>  or  divine  pastimes  etc.
Although these attributes are beyond the reach and  scope  of  non-devotees;
for His surrendered devotees He, Himself is not able to behold His  devotees
pangs of separation from Him and thus Lord Krishna  is  incapable  of  being
separated from them due to the fact that He is  totally  attached  to  their
feelings of deep love for  Him  in  <i>vatsalya  rasa</i>  or  parental  affection,
<i>sakhya rasa</i> or affectionate friendship, etc. So the <i>yogi</i>  who  has  achieved
such an exalted state internally who  is  always  thinking  of  Him  who  is
always expressing devotion to Him with consciousness  unwavering  from  Him.
Such a person is equally as dear to Him and thus  very  easily  is  able  to
have regular communion with the Supreme Lord.

This verse also infers that He is not easily accessible  to  those  who  are
not His devotee even  if  thy  have  dedicated  their  lives  to  performing
different <i>yoga</i> practices.  The reason for this being is that Lord  Krishna's
transcendental nature is such that He can  only  be  accessed  by  exclusive
devotion and by no other way. Various Vedic scriptures confirm that only  by
by <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion can the Supreme Lord  by  revealed.  The  Katha
Upanisad I.II.VII states: The Supreme Lord is He whom, even  when  heard  is
not known without loving devotion. The  Katha  Upanisad  I.II.XXIII  states:
The Supreme Lord is not to be attained by  instruction,  nor  by  intellect,
nor by instruction. He is attained only by one whom He has chosen  and  only
to such a one  does  He  reveals  Himself.  So  it  is  absolute  that  only
<i>bhakti</i> can attract Him and only <i>bhakti</i> can reveal  Him.  So  <i>bhakti</i>  is  the
best.
