It may also be questioned how is it that  <i>paramatma</i>  or  the  all  pervading
Supreme Soul and the localised <i>atma</i> or  individual  immortal  soul  are  not
contaminated and infected by the  material  qualities  associated  with  the
physical body such as pleasure and pain,  joy  and  distress.  Lord  Krishna
replies to such with the analogy  of  ether  which  atomically  is  existing
everywhere all through <i>prakriti</i> the material substratum  pervading  physical
existence and as such is not contaminated or modified by any object. In  the
same way <i>paramatma</i> and the <i>atma</i> although abiding within the physical  bodies
of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings is  not  contaminated  or  modified  by  the
merits or demerits associated with the actions of the physical body.
