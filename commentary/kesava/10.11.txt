Listening attentively to the Supreme Lord Krishna's unequivocal  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
transcendental opulence, and unlimited supremacy in brief,  Arjuna  appetite
for hearing more increased and he became  enthusiastic  to  learn  more  and
more about the infinite, divine glories of Lord  Krishna  and  in  order  to
assure the Lord that he was fully convinced of everything that was  told  to
him, Arjuna first confirms Lord Krishna is the Supreme Absolute  Truth  with
the words <i>param brahma</i> and  then  he  confirms  that  Lord  Krihsna  is  the
shelter of all creation with the words <i>param  dhama</i>  and  then  he  verifies
these statements as being in total agreement with the  <i>mahatmanas</i>  or  great
liberated sages such as Narada and  Vyasa  who  are  able  to  perceive  all
truths and who can see the subtlest reality speak of  Lord  Krishna  as  the
purest of the purest, the auspicious of the auspicious, self-manifest, self-
effulgent, eternal, immutable, of unchangeable, divine  form,  the  ultimate
goal, residing in the highest, paramount spiritual abode  as  a  personality
with transcendental qualities, features and attributes. The prime  cause  of
all  causes,  the  source  and  origin  of  all  that  exists.   omniscient,
omnipotent, omnipresent and all  pervading.  The  Vedic  scriptures  declare
this to be the absolute truth,  the  <i>mahatmanas</i>  proclaim  this  to  be  the
absolute truth and Lord Krishna Himself  also  verifies  that  this  is  the
absolute truth.
<p>
In Bhisma Parva of Mahabharata there is a hymn  by  Brahma  that  states:  O
king by brahmins, sages and demigods it was told in ancient times  that  the
Supreme Lord Krishna is the God above all other  gods  such  as  myself  and
Shiva. The celestial sage Narada declared Lord Krishna as knowing the  minds
and hearts of all beings. The venerated  sage   Markandeya  Rishi  expressed
Lord Krishna as embodying past, present and future.  Venerable  Bhrgu  named
Lord  Krishna  as  the  austerity  of  all  austerities  and  the  <i>yagna</i>  or
worshipful propitiation of all <i>yagna.</i> Vyasa proclaimed  that Lord  Krishna's
form is sac-cid-ananda unlimited knowledge, eternal existence  and  unending
bliss. Lord Krishna is the bestower of <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence and He appoints Indra the ruler of the demigods on his  throne  in
the heavenly worlds. Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord of all lords and  gods
and every other conception of divinity.
<p>
The sage Angiras at the time of creation declared  Lord  Krishna  as  <i>Daksa-</i>
<i>Prajapati</i> the creator of all lords,  gods  and  demigods.  The  sage  Devala
proclaimed Lord Krishna was unmanifest in  the  body  but  manifest  in  the
heart and mind of all beings. The  sage  Asita  expressed  Lord  Krishna  as
pervading the sky with His head and the  Earth  with  His  chest  while  His
stomach represents the three  worlds.  The  four  Kumaras  headed  by  Sanat
eulogise Lord Krishna as <i>param  brahma</i>  the  supreme,  eternal  personality,
<i>parama dhama</i> the supreme shelter, the ultimate goal  for those endowed  with
the fruits  of  austerities,  those   who  are  self-satisfied  and  content
through  self-realisation  and  for  those  great,  royal  kings   who   are
irrevocably committed to  war  and  battle  for  the  sake  of  establishing
righteousness. So in all these various ways  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is
worshipped and glorified by realised beings.
<p>
Also in the Bhishma Parva there is a dialogue between the Brahma and  Narada
and the <i>Gandharvas</i> who are celestial singers,  musicians  and  dancers  were
extremely astonished to see Brahma exhibit great reverence  and  were  eager
to know who it was that he praised so wonderfully with such eloquent  hymns.
Being pleased Brahma stated: O best of beings I spoke with the Supreme  Lord
with joy who is <i>neti neti or</i> transcendental to  this  and  that  and  beyond
becoming and coming into being. The Supreme Lord  Krishna  is  the  <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul of all beings and the Supreme Goal  of  all  beings.  I  humbly
prayed to Him to bless this world and evoked Him to come with the prayer:  O
Supreme Lord Krishna, I beseech you to bestow your causeless mercy and  come
to this world of mortals and appear on this Earth  for  the  destruction  of
the demoniac. The demons such as the sons of Diti and Danu and the hosts  of
demoniac beings that were terminated by You in  previous  epochs,  have  now
taken birth on Earth with terrible  forms  and  great  might.  In  order  to
eradicate the demoniac  presence  on  Earth  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  in
association with  Nara  will  manifest  in  His  <i>avatar</i>  or  incarnation  as
Narayana  and  appearing  in  a  human  form  will  move  about  the   Earth
establishing righteousness. Those  same  two  ancient  and  great  sages  of
infallible lustre known as  Nara-Narayana  who  were  invincible  in  battle
against all the demoniac hosts  have  appeared  upon  Earth  again  as  Lord
Krishna in His original form along with His friend  and  devotee  Arjuna  to
destroy all the demoniac forces once more. The infatuated  and  deluded  are
unable to understand and perceive Him who is my eternal liege and Lord.
<p>
The Supreme Lord Krishna,  the  Paramount  Lord  of  all  creation  and  the
ultimate goal of all beings should be the sole object of all endeavours  and
worship. The  Supreme  absolute  ruler  of  all  creation  should  never  be
forgotten or neglected. He is the highest reality, the  Supreme  glory,  the
ultimate destination, imperishable, eternal, the cause  and  the  source  of
all that exists. Whose <i>nama</i> or name, <i>rupa</i> or transcendental  form,  <i>lila</i>  or
divine  pastimes  and  <i>dhama</i>  or  eternal  abode  are  sung  and   glorified
throughout the Vedic scriptures. But who at the  same  time  is  beyond  the
scope of worldly knowledge. So all the  demigods,  humans  and  gods  should
never disregard Lord Krishna's words which precisely presents  the  ultimate
truth and  one  should  never  disrespect  His  activities  which  concisely
represents the ultimate reality. Yet  because  His  eternal,  transcendental
body appears in human form the foolish and deluded  of  wretched  conception
look at the infallible Supreme Lord as a mere human being and fallible  like
themselves.
<p>
In the Harivamsa there is a  passage  where  Shiva  instructs  some  brahmin
sages stating: O' devotees of the Supreme Lord  Krishna  who  have  realised
the truth. He is the ultimate reality  and  propitiation  unto  Him  is  the
ultimate austerity. As there is  nothing  higher  or  superior  to  Him  one
should always meditate upon Him with a controlled mind because He  the  best
well wisher and the prime duty of human  life  to  worship.  He  is  eternal
piety, the reward of all penance, the abode of all merit  and  the  goal  as
well as the bestower of <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the material existence.  It
is to He alone that the knowers of  the  <i>brahman</i>  the  spiritual  substratum
pervading  all  existence  and  those  who  have  achieved  <i>atma-tattva</i>   or
realisation of the soul, pay homage too and  eulogise  proficiently.  He  is
the sole destination prescribed in the Vedic scriptures so sought  after  by
those even after attaining <i>moksa.</i> It is he whom the the scholars of  <i>Samkhya</i>
and <i>Astanga</i> glorify. The Vaisnavas declare him as the path and the goal  for
the knowers of the <i>brahman.</i> But there is no need O' devotees to  ponder  and
deliberate further the purpose of existence is to realise  Him  only.  Being
amply endowed with the qualities of <i>sattva guna</i> the  mode  of  goodness  one
should always meditate upon the Supreme Lord Krishna  and  His  incarnations
and expansions as authorised by Vedic scriptures as there is no  higher  god
and no worthier goal.
<p>
In closing Arjuna reaffirms Lord Krishna glories by stating that He  Himself
also previously expressed the same in X:VIII, X.II  and  VII.VII  confirming
respectively that He is the cause of all creation, the prime source  of  all
gods and sages and that nothing exists without Him,
