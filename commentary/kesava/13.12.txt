The Supreme Lord Krishna known as <i>Parabrahma</i> is the source  of  the  <i>brahman</i>
or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence.   It  is  solely   His
effulgence that illuminates all luminaries  such  as  the  sun,  the  stars,
lightning, jewels,  etc.  with  light.  These  luminaries  only  dispel  the
darkness hindering the vision between the eyes  and  their  objects  whereas
the knowledge of a mere  spark  of  the  Supreme  Lord  being  the  <i>atma</i>  or
immortal  soul  illuminates  all  physical  lights  and  without  the   <i>atma</i>
knowledge of illumination is not possible. That is why the <i>atma</i> is  said  to
be totally beyond the darkness of <i>maya</i> which  is   the  deluding,  external,
illusory potency of the Supreme Lord. The illusory nature of  <i>maya</i>  is  ever
changing by nature whereas the <i>atma</i> is eternal and unchanging. The  <i>atma</i>  is
itself  knowledge as well as the goal of all knowledge and  is  most  worthy
of attaining by the acquisition of knowledge. The qualifications  to  obtain
this knowledge is found in the 20 excellent  virtues  expounded  earlier  in
verse 8 to 12 beginning with reverence,  humility  etc.  which  are  in  the
hearts  of  all  human  beings  albeit  dormant   or   active.   The   words
<i>hrdi</i> <i>sarvasya  dhisthitam</i>  emphasises  that  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is
specially situated in the etheric heart of all living entities.
