Now Lord Krishna is clarifying that He is not only giving this
instruction but that He follows the performance of  prescribed
Vedic activities  as  well  for  the  welfare  of  the  world.
Although He is the Supreme Lord of all with no need to  attain
what He already possesses still Lord  Krishna  performs  Vedic
activities in His form or the form of any  of  His  authorised
incarnations to set the example and so  that  all  the  worlds
will beneftit.
