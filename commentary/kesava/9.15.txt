The most excellent <i>mahatmanas</i> or great noble souls worship the Supreme  Lord
Krishna by <i>jnana yagnena</i> or  propitiation  by  knowledge.  Other  <i>mahatmanas</i>
chant His names and glories and also by propitiation of  knowledge  offering
worship to Him in His universal cosmic form facing  all  directions  in  all
locations as the all pervasive <i>paramatma</i> or supreme soul within  all  living
entities. In the Chandogya Upanisad III.XIV.I it states:  Verily  the  whole
creation is <i>brahman</i> or the Supreme  Lord's  spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence. Tranquilly one should worship it as the  source  from  whence
one came forth, as that source to where one will go hence  and  as  that  in
which one breathes. All creation is verily  the  <i>paramatma</i>  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna. Everything is Lord Krishna, He  is  omnipresent,  the  highest
person, the one and only Supreme Lord.  He  is  realised  as  the  universal
cosmic form of all existence comprised of phenomenally unlimited  variations
of all animate and inanimate beings. The Katha Upanisad V.XIII  states:  The
Supreme Lord  who  is  constant  among  the  inconstant,  intelligent  among
intelligences,  the  one  among  the  many,  who  grants  desires.  In   the
Brhadaranyaka Upanisad III.VII.II states: That he who dwells  in  the  earth
does not know whose body the Earth is or who controls the Earth from  within
is the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul, the inner monitor and  controller.  The  Katha
Upanisad V.X.XI states: As one  wind  has  entered  the  world  and  becomes
corresponding in form to every form, so the one inner <i>atma</i> of all things  is
corresponding in form to every form and yet is separate from  them.  As  the
sun which is the  eye  of  the  universe  shining  upon  everything  is  not
compromised by the external  faults  of  the  eyes;  in  the  same  way  the
immortal soul of all beings is not compromised by the  evil  manifesting  in
the world, being external  to  it.  Thus  the  most  excellent  great  souls
worship the Supreme Lord Krishna as totally  different  from  this  universe
comprised of animate and inanimate beings because although He is within  all
various  diverse  and  variegated  forms  as  <i>paramatma</i>  He  is   completely
unaffected by them.
