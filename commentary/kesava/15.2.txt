Describing  the  roots  and  branches  of  the  <i>asvattha</i>  or   banyan   tree
allegorically  to  symbolise  material  existence.  Lord   Krishna   further
explains that the branches that rise  upwards  symbolise  the  higher  level
<i>jivas</i> or embodied beings such as the  demigods  and  humans.  The   branches
that turn downwards are lower level <i>jivas</i> such as animals, birds,  fish  and
plants. The roots extend upwards to Satya loka the highest  material  planet
of Brahma and extends  downwards  also  into  the  worlds  of  humans  where
innumerable new sub-roots manifest which  are  the  <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  to
actions performed by every  human.  The  twigs  are  impressions  from  past
desires and the sprouts are the desired sense objects.  All  parts  of  this
tree  are  within  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum  pervading   physical
existence and are nourished by the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of  material  nature
which are <i>sattva</i> or goodness, <i>rajas</i>  or  passion  and  <i>tamas</i>  or  nescience.
Those lower level <i>jivas</i> who have degenerated into various forms of  demoniac
entities due to performing evil activities to others  as  well  as  degraded
activities unto themselves inevitably sink into  the  fiery  hellish  worlds
for aeons and aeons of atonement. Contrarily  the  higher  level  <i>jivas</i>  who
adhered to the injunctions and prohibitions of the Veidc scriptures  receive
meritorious births in the heavenly worlds of the  demigods.  Possessing  the
nature of good or evil each <i>jivas karma</i> binds them in <i>samsara</i> the  perpetual
cycle of birth and death and is manifested in <i>manusya</i> the worlds of  humans.

The purport is that after exhaustion of all <i>karma</i> and  its  residue  of  the
<i>jiva</i> enjoying ecstatically in the heavenly worlds or suffering in misery  in
the hellish worlds due to either following or ignoring the  injunctions  and
prohibitions of the  Vedic  scriptures.  One  is  rewarded  after  death  by
performing meritorious  deeds  or  punished  by  performing  degraded  deeds
during each human lifetime in pursuit of pleasure and  sense  gratification.
After hundreds of thousands of such lifetimes  these  desires  for  pleasure
become  deep  rooted  tendencies  that  causes   subtle  impressions  to  be
imprinted upon the subtle body of the <i>jiva</i> who takes birth in the worlds  of
humans. These impressions are  so  resolute  that  subconsciously  the  <i>jiva</i>
craves and seeks the  same  pleasures  enjoyed  in  the  previous  life  and
performs the  same  and  similar  activities  in  which  they  had  achieved
fulfillment before.
