In regard to the result of undesirable progeny. The intermixture  of  castes
that  follow the family customs and honor the age-old Vedic traditions  with
those that do not causes a degradation in society and leads the family to  a
hellish existence. Not only this but the anscestors of such  a  family  also
suffer as well because there is  no  descendant  qualified  to  perform  the
propitiatory rites prescribed in  Vedic  scriptures  such  as  <i>sraddha</i>   and
<i>tarpana.</i> .  Being  deprived  of  these  oblations  due  to  the  absence  of
qualified progeny as a result of destruction of  the  family  structure  the
ancestors fall down from heaven and go directly to the hellish planets.
