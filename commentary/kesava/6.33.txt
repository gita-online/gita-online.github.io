Now before Lord Krishna  answers  him.  Arjuna  also  wishes  to  know  what
becomes of the person  who  is  performing  actions  for  the  Supreme  Lord
without any  consideration  of  personal  gains  and  does  not  succeed  in
perfecting <i>yoga</i> or the science of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion with the ultimate consciousness. Because such  a  person  was  not
performing any  actions  for  entering  heaven  they  will  subsequently  be
unqualified for access to heaven and hence not connected anywhere.  This  is
what Arjuna is meaning in his analogy of a cloud split off  from  a  greater
cloud but unable to join an even greater cloud.  The  purport  is  that  the
<i>yogi</i>  abandoned  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  prescribed  Vedic  activities  to   become
established in the highest  path  of  <i>yoga</i>  by  <i>dhyana</i>  or  meditation;  but
subsequently failed to perfect it in their life. So missing  the  chance  to
enter <i>svarga loka</i> or the heavenly worlds and also  failing  to  attain  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the soul do they perish?
