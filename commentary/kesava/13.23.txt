Lord Krishna now presents the results of the afore stated realisations  that
of perceiving the Supreme Lord present within  all  bodies  demigod,  human,
animal, etc. and His imperishable nature present everywhere. Such a <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being <i>na hinasti</i> never degrades  <i>atmanam</i>  their  immortal  soul  by
being attached to material  desire  and  prolonging  their  imprisonment  in
material existence. The essence is one  who  sees  created  beings  separate
from the Supreme Lord and separate from  themselves  will  be  compelled  to
revolve in <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death  in  the  material
existence and continue to perform sinful and degraded activities that  keeps
them shackled permanently in the  prison  of  material  existence.  This  is
corroborated by Sakuntala's statement in Moksa Dharma that: Such a  one  who
has not realised the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul inherent within all beings;  what
sinful activity did such a cheater of themselves deign not  to  commit?  The
Isa Upanisad, verse  III  reveals  the  resultant  consequence  due  to  the
greatest ignorance for those that degrade their own <i>atma</i>  and  the  soul  of
others living entities by engaging in  evil  activities  of  unrighteousness
beginning: <i>asurya nama te loka andhena</i> meaning such sinful demons  oblivious
of their inherent divine nature enter the dark, gloomy hellish planets  when
their life has ended.
