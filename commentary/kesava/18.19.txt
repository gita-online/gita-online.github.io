Lord Krishna speaks of three types of  knowledge  determined  by  the  three
<i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature beginning with  <i>sattva  guna</i>  or  mode  of
goodness. One who while performing activities perceives the  one  undivided,
immutable and imperishable nature in the form of the <i>atma</i> or  immortal  soul
residing  within  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  simultaneously  such  as
demigods,  humans,  animals,  spirits,  etc.  which  are  merely  exhibiting
unlimited varieagated forms according to species and genre  is  one  who  is
firmly situated in <i>sattva guna.</i>
