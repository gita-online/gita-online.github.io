Although it is not possible to describe all Lord Krishna's vibhuti or
divine, transcendental opulence, still in order to please His devotees,
Lord Krishna concisely reveals that whatever being or object that possesses
brilliance, majesty and beauty and is excellently endowed with wisdom,
power and might should be known surely to be but a spark of effulgence from
Lord Krishna's vibhuti.
