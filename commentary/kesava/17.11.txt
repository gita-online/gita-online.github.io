Now in order to  introduce  the  threefold  divisions  of  austerities  Lord
Krishna commences with austerities which can be performed  by  the  physical
body, verbal speech as well as the mind. The worship  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna the origin of all creation and any of  His  authorised  incarnations
and expansions as revealed in Vedic scriptures who  each  far  excels  every
other god imaginable such as Brahma and Shiva, as well as far excelling  all
other gods  of  other  conceptions  collectively  combined  are  pre-eminent
austerities in <i>sattva</i> guna the mode of goodness. Worship  of  the  Vaisnavas
and brahmanas, worship of the <i>diksa guru</i>  the  initiating  spiritual  master
and the  <i>siksa  guru</i>  the  instructing  spiritual  master,  who  dispel  the
darkness of ignorance by revealing the eternal, spiritual truths  applicable
to all existences in all times and external  and  internal  cleanliness  are
all in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of  goodness.  <i>Arjavam</i>  is  acting  without
duplicity in thought, word  or  deed.  <i>Brahmacaryam</i>  is  celibacy  which  is
abstinence  from  all  sexual  activities.  The  Agni  Purana:  CCCLXX.IX.XI
specifically refers to the eightfold forms of celibacy which  is  abstinence
from all sexual activity and includes: thinking about it, talking about  it,
suggestively insinuating it,  watching  others  engaging  in  it,  affirming
desire for it, wooing another for it, meeting in private for it and  finally
engaging oneself in it. <i>Ahimsa</i> is non-violence to any creature  by  thought,
word and deed. The particle <i>ca</i>  stands  to  include  non-cheating  and  non-
stealing. etc. All these activities are situated in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode  of
goodness.
