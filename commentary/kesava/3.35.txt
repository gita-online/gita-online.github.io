It should not be presumed that  a  person  abstaining  from  a
negative  direction  to  pursue  the  ascetic  life  of   non-
violence, meditation, virtuousness and self-satisfaction seems
superior for worshipping the Supreme Lord. What  is  therefore
the purpose of a warriorâs duty to perform  cruel  deeds  upon
the battlefield in pursuit of victory  and  self-preservation.
Anticipating such a doubt Lord Krishna states it is better  to
follow oneâs own duties according to station and rank in  life
as enjoined  by  the  Vedic  scriptures.  Because  to  perform
anotherâs duty is not authorised in the Vedic  scriptures  and
being prohibited is fraught  with  dangers.  According  to  te
scriptural injunction: One who exempts themselves  from  their
prescribed actions as enjoined in  the  Vedic  scriptures,  is
never qualified to perform the prescribed actions of a  higher
station. Such actions is prohibited.
