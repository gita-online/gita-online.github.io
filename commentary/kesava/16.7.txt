Lord Krishna confirms that the demoniac embracing the  doctrine  of  atheism
negate their own <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  because  of  illusion  and  their
inability to accept anything other than the direct perception of  what  they
experience with their mind and  senses.  Hence  life  after  life  they  are
oblivious to the eternal spiritual position inherent within  them  and  they
become deluded lost souls. The conceptions they  adhere  to  are  fallacious
and  their  activities  are  despicable  because  they  lack  discriminative
knowledge of the difference between the <i>atma</i> and the physical body. What  is
eternal and what is not eternal. What should be accepted and what should  be
rejected. Thus they are evilly disposed, enemies of all, full  of  violence,
devoted to  diabolical  actions  and  the  root  of  chaos  and  destruction
throughout creation.
