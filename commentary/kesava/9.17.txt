Lord Krishna confirms that He is the  sustainer  of  all  creation  and  the
actual impeller of all beings to create distinct from the seminal  birth  of
parents. In this way He is the father, the mother and grandsire of  all.  He
is the ultimate to be known and He the  purifying  sacred  syllable  OM  His
personal sound vibration and He is the sacred Rig, Sama and the  Yajur  Veda
from where the Atharva Veda was extracted.
