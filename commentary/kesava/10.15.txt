The  necessity  of  accurately  and  distinctly  knowing  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna's <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental opulence is expressed by  Arjuna
with the word <i>katham vidyam aham</i> meaning how to  know.  The  word  <i>yogim</i>  is
expressing that Lord Krishna is the master of <i>yoga</i> or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness. Being inferior to the Supreme Lord  it  is  not  possible  to
fathom His glories, powers and paramount supremacy without His mercy  so  he
is requesting Lord Krishna to explain  His  unimaginable  glories  that  are
beyond even elevated and advanced conceptions so he can get an idea  how  to
correctly meditate upon the Supreme Lord and not  imagine  or  concoct  some
ideas that have no validity to reality. Because only the Supreme Lord  knows
Himself and it is not possible to understand and meditate upon Him in full.
