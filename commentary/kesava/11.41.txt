Since the Supreme Lord Krishna is the highest object of adoration and
attainment beyond comparison to anything else it is natural that Arjuna
seeking to propitiate Him would prostrate his full body upon the ground in
supplication. The Supreme Lord who is worthy of all praise and honour from
everyone. Who has equanimity towards all. Who is the complete refuge of
everyone is being humbly beseeched by Arjuna to mercifully forgive any
offences he may have incurred exactly like a father, a friend or a lover
mercifully forgives the faults of a son, another friend and the beloved
respectively. The word arhasi means be merciful and the word sodhum means
forgive.
