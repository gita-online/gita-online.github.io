Now Lord Krishna defines <i>tama guna</i> or the mode of ignorance. The word  <i>tamas</i>
means darkness  and is  typified by nescience and inertia. It is subject  to
the greatest delusion that imagines a permanent and pleasant  experience  in
a  temporary  and  unpleasant  existence.  Those  humans  that   look   upon
themselves as being their physical body like the animals do and  who  accept
their physical body as being all that they are all  hopelessly  situated  in
<i>ajnana</i> or absence of knowledge which is the antithesis of <i>jnana</i>  or  wisdom.
<i>Jnana</i>  is  the  accurate  precise  understanding  whereas  <i>ajnana</i>   is   the
inaccurate perverted understanding. The inaccurate  perverted  understanding
binds the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being through <i>pramada</i> or madness  which  includes
listlessness  and  bewilderment,  <i>alasya</i>   or   indolence   which   includes
sluggishness and laziness and <i>nidrbhis</i> or sleep which includes  inebriation.
Sleep is the cessation of bodily organs arising  from  mental  and  physical
exhaustion. All of these are permanently situated in <i>tama guna</i> and  invoking
ignorance tightly bind the <i>jiva.</i>
