How wonderful and marvellous is  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  relationship
with  His  devotee.  That  He  the  Supreme  independent  autocrat  of   all
existence, the absolute controller of all creation  will  accept  and  enjoy
the  most  simple  things  like  a  leaf  or  flower  and  He   accepts   it
wholeheartedly. Now it should be  made  clear  what  is  this  rare  quality
possessed by His devotees that gives them  the  privilege  of  becoming  His
devotee. In answer to this Lord Krishna emphasises with the words  <i>yat,  yad</i>
and <i>yaj</i> meaning whatever and whichever. In other words all that one does  in
accordance with the regulations and  injunctions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures
whether they are natural or  prescribed,  whatever  is  eaten,  whatever  is
prayed for,  whatever  is  performed  as  a  daily  obligatory  rite  or  an
occasional special ritual, everything should done  as  an  offering  to  the
Supreme Lord. The conclusion is the rare qualification to become  a  devotee
to Lord Krishna is that they completely surrender themselves totally to  Him
including all sense of doership. Dedicating their lives to Him as the  means
and the goal the ultimate attainment they are resolute in the  understanding
that He is the absolute controller of every action that manifests in all  of
creation and the sole rewarder of all <i>karma</i> or reactions to actions in  this
life, the next life and all future lives. So with this  clear  comprehension
fully understood they  devote  themselves  to  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving
devotion dedicating everything to Him.
