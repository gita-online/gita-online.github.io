One lacking in self control and devoid of  piety,  who  is  vain,  vile  and
vulgar  an.  Who   identifies   with   mundane   material   nature   without
discriminative knowledge. Who is deceitful, lethargic  and  morose.  Who  is
offensive to others and who procrastinates in doing what is  expected.  Such
unfortunates are indisputably situated in<i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance.
