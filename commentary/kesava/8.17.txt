Lord Krishna is now giving the reason why  people  who  reach  the  heavenly
worlds of Brahma and others are still subjected to <i>samsara</i> or the  perpetual
cycle of birth and death because of the periodic time factors these  planets
are regulated by. Those who by the truth of the Vedic scriptures  know  that
Brahma's day and night is comprised of 2000 <i>Maha Yugas</i> which  is  equivalent
to the duration of the four <i>yugas</i> or ages being  <i>Satya  Yuga</i>  consisting  of
1,728,000 years, <i>Treta Yuga</i> consisting  of  1,296,000  years,  <i>Dvarapa  Yuga</i>
consisting of 864,000 years and <i>Kali Yuga</i> consisting of  432,000  years  all
totalling 4,320,000 years multiplied againg by 2000 factually know  what  is
day and night because they know the true reality of  time.  All  others  who
base their knowledge of day and night by  the  mere  calculations  of  solar
movements are not knowers  of  day  and  night  and  are  limited  in  their
consciousness. One year on Earth is equal to one day and one  night  in  the
heavenly spheres. One day and one night in the  heavenly  worlds  multiplied
by 12,000 years equals one <i>Maha Yuga</i> equalling 4,320, 000 years.  1000  <i>Maha</i>
<i>Yugas</i> is one day of Brahma and another  1000  <i>Maha  Yuga</i>  is  one  night  of
Brahma both totalling 8 billion 640 million years and is known as  a  <i>kalpa</i>.
One year of Brahma is 360 of these <i>kalpas</i>s or 180,000 <i>Maha  Yugas</i>  which  is
360 days multiplied by 8 billion 640 million which totals  to  26  trillion,
438 billion and 400 million years  on  Earth.  Brahma  lives  100  of  these
years. One who understands this is a true knower of day and night.

So in this way all the material worlds are always  temporary  due  to  being
periodically regulated by the time factor. Naturally beings who reach  these
worlds are subject to these periodic regulations and thus are  subjected  to
rebirth in the worlds of mortals. This is the case in the  highest  material
world of Brahma in <i>Maharloka</i> all the way down to the lower  worlds  such  as
<i>Pataloka</i>. It should be understood that  in  all  material  worlds  there  is
rebirth.
