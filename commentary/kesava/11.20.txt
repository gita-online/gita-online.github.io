The descriptions of the afflictions which were experienced  is  iterated  in
this verse and the next two. All creation was greatly alarmed by  the  fiery
all pervading aspect of Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or  divine  universal  form
which  appeared  terrifying  and  frightening.  The  demigods  being  direct
servitors of the Supreme Lord  functioning  in  the  capacity  of  universal
management approached Him for shelter while others of them being  frightened
stayed  a  far  distance  and  with  folded   palms   offered   prayers   of
supplication. Hosts of exalted sages and perfected  beings  could  be  heard
shouting <i>Jaya! Jaya!</i> All glory! All glory! Observing the unlimited faces  of
the <i>visvarupa</i> with their mouths emitting blazing fire like  the  devastating
inferno  at  the  time  of   universal   destruction.   Benevolently   these
enlightened  and  liberated  sages  chanted  <i>svastity</i>  meaning  may  all  be
auspicious and extolled the Supreme Lord  with  excellent  hymns  describing
His greatness and choice prayers praising  His  glories  entreating  Him  to
protect all creation.
