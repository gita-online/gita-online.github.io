Thus after presenting how the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature
influence  knowledge,  action,  agent,  intellect  and  determination;  Lord
Krishna elaborates upon the three types of <i>sukham</i> or happiness  aspired  for
by every human being because all of the aforementioned factors  are  enacted
for the sake of receiving happiness. Now the three forms of <i>sukham</i>  will  be
explained to reveal what is to be embraced and what is to  be  avoided.  The
<i>sukham</i> by which one experiences unabated pleasure by consistent practice  of
devotion, meditation and adoration of the Supreme Lord  Krishna  or  any  of
His authorised incarnations as revealed in Vedic scriptures is  situated  in
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness. Such <i>sukham</i> is unhampered by the pangs  of
sense gratification and the attraction for sense objects and  its  temporary
illusions of pleasure. Hence that which in  the  beginning  by  practice  of
detachment, restraint, renunciation, austerities,  meditation,  etc.  appear
to be like poison but at the end when they  have  been  perfected  are  just
like nectar, extremely delicious. By meditation on the Supreme Lord  Krishna
and constantly focused internally on the <i>atma</i>  r  immortal  soul  one  stays
established in <i>sattva guna.</i> The serenity and  equanimity  one  derives  from
such <i>sukham</i> is like an elixir to the purified mind arising from  abandonment
of desire and cessation of passion, greed and infatuation that  are  the  by
products of <i>raja guna</i> the  mode  of  passion  and  <i>tama  guna</i>  the  mode  of
ignorance.
