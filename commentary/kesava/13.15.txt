Lord Krishna having explained the evolutionary cycle of material nature,  He
explains of the respective functions of matter  and  spirit  as  they  exist
conjointly.  The  words  <i>karya-karana-kartrtve</i>  mean  the  results  of   the
combination of the evolution of the bodily  organs  and  functions  and  the
influence of the presiding demigods on  the  senses  which  when  coming  in
contact with matter are the cause of the <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  soul  to  be  in
bondage experiencing the consequence of their <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  to  good
and bad actions  and  obliged  to  accept  happiness  and  misery.  This  is
unavoidable as long as one remains  infatuated  and  attracted  to  material
existence.
