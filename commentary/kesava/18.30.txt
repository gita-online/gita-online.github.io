Here Lord Krishna explains that <i>buddhi</i>  or  intellect  of  one  situated  in
<i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion distorts reality and  misunderstands  what  is
right and what is wrong, what should be done and what should  not  be  done.
Performing action at the wrong time, in the wrong place, in the  wrong  way.
What is prohibited they engage in and what is ordained they abstain from.
