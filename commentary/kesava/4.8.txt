Here the  verse  reads  <i>parittranya  sadhunam</i>  meaning  for  protecting  the
virtuous such protection means specifically for the devotees like Prahlad  a
great devotee of the Supreme Lord even as a child. His father  Hiranyakasipu
the demon king was so inimical to devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord  that  he
tried to kill his own son many times but  protected  by  the  Supreme  Lord,
Prahlad was never harmed. Yamaraj the demigod in charge of death who  weilds
the rod of  punishment  meted  out  to  the  hellish  planets;  informs  his
servants to never approach the devotees of the Supreme Lord who  behold  all
with equal vision having taken complete refuge in  Him  and  are  under  His
infallible protection; for neither old age or  ourselves  are  qualified  to
chastise the devotees  in  any  way.  Bring  to  me  those  who  have  never
meditated on the  Supreme  Lord  within  their  heart,  bring  to  me  those
unrighteous  persons  of  unclean  demeanour  who  do  not   perform   their
prescribed  duties  and  bring  to  me  those  wretched  sinners   who   are
antagonistic and opposed to devotion to the Supreme Lord. So not  only  does
the Supreme Lord Krishna destroys the miscreants but His servitors  such  as
Yamaraj punishes them as well. All this  is  to  enable  <i>sanatan  dharma</i>  or
eternal righteousness to be established once again.
