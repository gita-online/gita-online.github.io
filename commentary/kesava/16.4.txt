If one were to  argue  why  devilish  properties  are  included  within  the
demoniac nature then the conclusion would have to be that it is  so  because
devilish properties can never be considered as part of  the  divine  nature.
The Brihadaranyaka Upanisad V.I.I beginning  <i>trayah  prajapatyah  prajapatau</i>
<i>pitari</i> states:  Brahma  created  the  divine  beings,  demoniac  beings  and
humans. Since humans are mentioned separately in  which  category  are  they
situated in? To clarify this point clearly Lord  Krishna  explains  that  in
the worlds of mortals there are only two types of  beings.  The  divine  and
the  demoniac.  The  qualities  and  attributes  of  the  divine  have  been
described in detail in chapters  seven,  nine  and  twelve.  The  thirteenth
chapter examined the 24 virtues beginning with <i>amanitvam</i> or  humility  which
are all part of the divine nature.  The  fourteenth  chapter  disclosed  the
characteristics of a person who has transcended the effects of the <i>gunas</i>  or
three modes of material nature. The  fifteenth  continued  the  instructions
with freedom from pride and infatuation in verse 5 and in verse one of  this
chapter Lord Krishna concludes the theme with 26 virtues beginning with  the
word <i>abhayam</i> meaning fearlessness due to knowing the <i>atma</i> or  immortal  soul
is eternal and can never be destroyed.  Thus  the  divine  nature  has  been
extensively elaborated and elucidated.
<p>
Now Lord Krishna discloses the characteristics and behaivior  of  those  who
follow the demoniac nature. The particle <i>eva</i> meaning  only  is  inserted  to
dissect the fact that devils are included among the demoniac.  In  each  day
of Brahma creation commences which exists for 4 billion  320  million  years
and accounts for the 43,200,000 births every human has based on a  100  year
life cycle. At the beginning of  every  creation  humans  are  born  of  two
types: the divine and the  demoniac.  They  are  precisely  sorted  out  and
tabulated according to their previous righteous actions  which  gives  merit
and their previous unrighteous actions which gives demerit; that a  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being performed accumulatively in the previous creation along  with
the merits and demerits tabulated  according  to  what  food  they  consumed
because reactions are incurred in this as well. This is known  as  <i>karma</i>  or
reactions to the actions that one physically  engaged  themselves  in  their
previous lifespan and this karma precisely determines the  nature  of  their
next  birth.  Humans  born  of  the  divine  nature  performed   meritorious
activities of righteousness in the previous creation attuning themselves  to
the ordinances and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and  worship  of  the
Supreme Lord. Such a human is inherently graced by the Supreme Lord  with  a
tendency towards righteousness and  godliness  possessing  such  virtues  as
humility, compassion, self-restraint, etc.  Contrarily humans  born  of  the
demoniac  nature  performed  degraded  and  degenerated  activities  in  the
previous  creation  availing  themselves  to   diabolically   opposing   the
ordinances  and  injunctions  of  the  Vedic   scriptures   and   fiendishly
blaspheming righteousness and the  factual  reality  of  the  Supreme  Lord.
Such a human is invariably drawn to the unbridled lust of  passion  and  the
deepest darkness of ignorance possessing such characteristics  as  violence,
perversion, cruelty and evil. Hence such humans are known as demons.
<p>
As is stated in the Mukta Parva section of  the  Mahabharata.  Only  by  the
grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  as
authorised in Vedic scriptures does a <i>jiva</i> or embodied become  endowed  with
<i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of  goodness  gain  association  with  a  spiritual
preceptor and develop devotion to the Supreme Lord. If  a  <i>jiva</i>  worshipping
Brahma receives the grace of Brahma then they become endowed with <i>raja  guna</i>
the mode of passion. If a <i>jiva</i> worshipping Shiva is  graced  by  Shiva  then
they become endowed with <i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance.
