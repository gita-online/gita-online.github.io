If Lord Krishna were to  ask  why  Arjuna  was  saluting  Him  and  offering
obeisance to Him repeatedly again  and  again  from  all  directions  it  is
because he earnestly wants the Supreme Lord to forgive the  offence  of  not
recognising His Supreme Absolute position  as  the  Sovereign  Lord  of  all
creation. Arjuna previously was  ignorant  of  Lord  Krishna's  unparalleled
divine glory as the progenitor and controller  of  all  living  entities  in
existence even Brahma and looked  upon  Lord  Krishna  simply  as  his  best
friend  and  comrade  in  arms.  Now  Arjuna  is  feeling  remorse  for  any
indiscretion he may have made rashly or wantonly which could  have  shown  a
lack of respect for the Supreme Lord. He is worried that due to feelings  of
affection and familiarity he may have by impropriety or  through  negligence
offended the Supreme Lord in some way and he is beseeching Him  to  look  at
these things as minor misdemeanours and magnanimously forgive them.
