Having described the characteristics of the <i>ksetra</i>  or  field  of  activity,
Lord Krishna enumerates the attributes that  are  required  to  qualify  for
knowledge of the nature of <i>ksetra-jna</i> or knower of the  field  of  activity.
The absence of desire for  honour  and  the  absence  of  pride  imply  both
reverence for the Supreme Lord and  absence  of  hypocrisy.  Thus  a  person
becomes righteous by only performing pious  activities  in  accordance  with
the injunctions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures.  Such  a  person  automatically
follows <i>ahimsa</i> or non-violence to any living being by thought, word or  deed
and possesses tolerance towards others with  an  unperturbed  mind  even  if
they are antagonistic.  Straightforwardness  without  duplicity  is  another
quality found in such a person and  of  paramount  importance  is  rendering
unmotivated devotion to the spiritual master who illuminates  the  path  and
guides the  disciple  to  transcendental  knowledge.  The  Mundaka  Upanisad
I.II.XII beginning <i>parikshya lokan karmachitan</i> declares:  Accept  an  <i>acarya</i>
or spiritual preceptor who is learned and  established  in  the  <i>brahman</i>  or
spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence.  A  preceptor  is  only  a
spiritual master when his knowledge is established in the Vedic  scriptures,
when he is pureof heart, when he  has  received  Vaisnava  initiation  in  a
bonafide <i>parampara</i> or discipliic succession from an <i>acarya</i> devotee  of  Lord
Krishna or any of His  <i>avatars</i>  or  authorised  incarnations,  when  he  has
learned sacred rituals and holy mantras from such a preceptor,  when  he  is
devoted to chanting the Supreme Lord Krishna's holy names and  when  he  has
full unwavering faith in the eternal  truths  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  as
taught by his  spiritual  master  and  the  knowledge  of  these  truths  is
exemplified  in  his  everyday  life.  Only  such  an  exemplary  person  is
qualified to be an <i>acarya</i> or spiritual master.
<p>
Purity both externally in the body by earth and water and internally in  the
mind by discrimination, removing the mental  impurities  which  pollute  the
consciousness. This gives equipoise of mind  in  perturbing  situations  and
obstacles on the path of <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from  material  existence  and
also gives control over  the  body,  mind  and  senses,  keeping  them  from
impetuously rushing down wrong paths prohibited by  the  Vedic  injunctions.
Acquiring a dispassion of disinterest in  the  sights  and  sounds  of  this
world and even for the lure of delights in  the  heavenly  planets.  Absence
identifying the body with soul and lack of false ego  with  concepts  of  I-
ness and my-ness; or believing one is superior in some way arising from  any
transitory material conception such as believing  one  special  because  one
comes from a noble and distinguished lineage. Without spiritual  development
these conceptions have no value. Reflecting continuously  on  the  suffering
and misery of material existence which is unavoidable  because  inherent  in
birth is the inevitable old age, disease and death  and  the  perpetuity  of
this  life  after  life.  The  Chandogya   Upanisad   VIII.XII.I   beginning
<i>maghavanmartyam va idam</i> states: Verily  every  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being  is
subject to pleasure and pain.  Verily there is no  exemption  from  pleasure
and pain for any being while they are  embodied.  Verily  when  one  is  not
incorporeal in a physical  body  pleasure  and  pain  are  not  experienced.
Avoidance of overly attachment to wife, sons and family members as  well  as
wealth, home and property. Not agitated or unperturbed by  lifes  reversals,
equipoise in favourable and unfavourable circumstances.
<p>
To have unwavering and unalloyed exclusive loving devotion  to  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna and to worship His transcendental form both externally  in  the
temple and internally within the heart. Fondness for living in secluded  and
holy  places  and  avoidance  of  worldly  minded  people  uninterested   in
spiritual  matters  with  no  attraction  to  the  Supreme   Lord.   Because
association with saintly persons is essential for spiritual  development  it
is indispensable for one seeking to advance their spiritual life.  There  is
an ancient dialogue between the sage Cyavana instructing King  Nahusa  where
he tells him: One should associate with saintly  persons.  One  should  hear
instructions from saintly persons. One should indulge  in  discussions  with
saintly persons and make friendships only with  them;  but  never  with  the
wicked who should be avoided completely. Association  with  saintly  persons
is the medicine to remove the disease of materialism  but  association  with
the wicked is just like poison.
<p>
Finally constant devotion to <i>atma tattva</i> or  knowledge  of  the  soul.  That
true knowledge regarding the  soul  that  is  entirely  different  from  the
physical body. Observing the Supreme Lord everywhere in  everything  as  the
means to surmount ignorance and gain endless bliss from  liberation  by  His
eternal communion. The 20 attributes declared in these verses are  known  to
be knowledge and are the wisdom by which the Supreme Ultimate Truth  can  be
realised. Whatever is contrary to these 20 attributes is known as  ignorance
and is destructive of  wisdom leading to  the  Supreme  Ultimate  Truth  and
should by all means in every situation be avoided.
