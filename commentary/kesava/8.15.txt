Just as the Lord Krishna is easily attainable  by  His  exclusive  devotees;
other gods must be easily attainable to their votaries  as  well  and  grant
them all their desires objects. If this is the case what is  the  difference
between Lord Krishna's devotees and the votaries  of  any  other  god?  Lord
Krishna answers this with the words <i>mam upetya</i> meaning having attained  Him.
Having attained the Supreme Lord what comes of it?  The  <i>mahatmas</i>  or  great
souls are not subjected to rebirth ever again in the material existence  for
they have attained <i>paramam samsiddhim</i> the  highest  perfection.  Because  of
their extraordinary discriminating  powers  such  great,  noble  souls  have
correctly come to the ultimate conclusion that Lord Krishna is the  ultimate
goal  for  all  living  entities.  Always  thinking  of   Him,   consciously
performing all actions in propitiation to Him,  having  Him  exclusively  as
their nearest and dearest, by the grace of the Supreme Lord who  is  eternal
bliss personified one has qualified to join  Him  in  His  <i>lilas</i>  or  divine
pastimes and eternally perform transcendental pastimes with  Him  in  loving
devotion. Attaining this automatically  achieves  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  and
released from the excruciating pangs of material  existence  beginning  with
10 months of imprisonment in the womb of a mother then born in  a  house  of
sorrows known as the physical body and subjected to  disease,  old  age  and
death again and  again  endlessly.  No  other  god,  gods  or  demigods  can
bequeath liberation from material  existence  except  Lord  Krishna  and  no
other god, gods or demigods can sanction promotion to the eternal  spiritual
worlds except the Supreme Lord Krishna.
