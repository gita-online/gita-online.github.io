Who then are those who are blessed and praiseworthy? Lord  Krishna  declares
the <i>mahatmanas</i> or great souls whose hearts are not full of trivial,  mundane
desires. This is  because  all  their  sins  have  been  eradicated  by  the
multitudes  of  meritorious  deeds  performed  in  thousands   of   previous
lifetimes and thus  their  hearts  have  been  cleansed  of  all  dross  and
impurities and they possess the divine nature  which  will  be  specifically
explained later in verse one of chapter 16. These <i>mahatmanas</i> have  naturally
qualified themselves  for  contemplation  and  meditation  on  the  ultimate
absolute truth associated with the Supreme Lord. Thus knowing  Lord  Krishna
as the original source of all beings and primal cause of  all  creation  and
understanding that He descends and incarnates in His eternal spiritual  form
to bless, please and  protect  His  devotees;  such  great  beings  devoutly
worship Him exclusively with heartfelt love in single focused attention.
