Now Lord Krishna reveals  the  distinct  difference  between  <i>paramatma</i>  the
omnipresent and omniscient Supreme Soul which exists  within  the  heart  of
all living beings next to the  <i>atma</i>  or  localised,  immortal  soul  located
within each and every living entity. What then is <i>paramatma's</i>  real  nature.
He describes it by the word  <i>upadrasta</i>  or  impartial  witness  and  as  the
witness monitors the different stages and transformations of  the  mind  and
body.  He describes it as well by the word <i>anumanta</i> meaning  the  sanctioner
who approves and accepts the qualities of the mind and the functions of  the
body. He again describes it by the word <i>bharta</i> or the supporter because  for
a <i>jiva</i> to  progress  in  material  existence  the  mind  and  body  must  be
sustained and protected.  Although  <i>paramatma</i>  resides  within  the  etheric
heart of the physical body next to the <i>atma,</i> they are both purely  spiritual
being  distinct  from  the  physical  body  and  transcendent  to   material
existence.  He describes  it  also  as  being  <i>mahesvarah</i>  bor  the  supreme
controller because it also monitors, sanctions, supports  and  controls  all
the demigods  who  are  responsible  for  universal  maintenance  throughout
creation.

The essence is that the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being is the <i>ksetra-jna</i>  or  knower
of the field of  activity  is  referred  to  as  the  highest  self  because
factually it the best part of the body, mind and senses and  most  important
because it is connected to the <i>atma</i> the innermost self which can  comprehend
and realise all  things.  This  is  confirmed  in  the  Taittiriya  Upanisad
II.IV.I beginning <i>yato vacho nivartante</i> which reveals: The Supreme  Lord  is
the innermost witness residing in the etheric heart  of every <i>jiva.</i>
