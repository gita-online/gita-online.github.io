Here Lord Krishna reveals the words of Prajapati or Brahma the
creator of the forms and categories of material beings and the
arranger of the material manifestation. Here  it  states  that
one desiring liberation should perform selfless  actions  with
the thought of appeasement and  propitiation  to  the  Supreme
Lord. Now Lord  Krishna  is  infering  that  he  teaches  this
knowledge of propitiatiopn  to  His  devotees  only.  This  is
because Brahma has given facilty for  beings  other  than  the
devotees to worship in appeasement lesser  gods  such  as  the
demi-gods. Thus after Brahma created mankind he instructed the
three twice born classes of brahmins, ksatriyas and vaisyas to
perform selfless actions in  the  spirit  of  worship  of  the
Supreme Lord and this will be for you sacrifice. Sacrifing the
desires for reward and attachment to the results and  in  this
way  mankind   will   flourish   and   prosper.   The   actual
understanding is that this spirit of sacrifice perfromed  with
faith acording to ones status and stage in life will  bequeath
all auspiciousness in  this  life  and  the  next  life.  Such
instructions for such wishfulfilling actions and the confusion
that might arise to  due  to  them  from  statements  of  non-
attachment earlier in this chapter in verses four, seven   and
seventeen as well as refering to delighting  in  the  atma  or
soul  in  this  chapter  in  verses  three  and  nineteen   is
empasising different approaches to  the  same  goal  based  on
qualification so there is no contradiction.
