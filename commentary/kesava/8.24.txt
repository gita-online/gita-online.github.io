First Lord Krishna presents the  path  by  which  there  is  no  return  for
rebirth with the words <i>agnir-jyotir</i> which identify  the  presiding  demigods
respectively  of  fire  and  illumination.   The   Brihadaranyaka   Upanisad
VI.II.XII states: By this way they reach the all effulgent. So on this  path
of no return are stationed the demigods identified with fire,  illumination,
day, the moons 15 day bright fortnight  and  the  six  months  of  the  suns
northern waxing course. The <i>yogis</i> or those perfecting  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness, who have realised the <i>brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence, they proceed on the path of no return  after  death
guided by the aforementioned presiding demigods of the time divisions  until
they finally reach the very <i>brahman</i> they have realised.  All  terms  stating
time periods denote  the  respective  demigods  of  those  time  periods  as
declared in the Chandogya Upanisad  V.X.I-II  as  follows:  Those  who  have
realised the <i>brahman</i> as well as those who meditating in the wilderness  with
faith and austerity at death are guided by a demigod for each  time  period,
first through the  fire,  from  the  fire  to  the  illumination,  from  the
illumination to the day, from the day to the moons  bright  fortnight,  from
the bright fortnight into the six months of the suns northern  waxing,  from
the six  months they are guided into the year, from the year into  the  sun,
from the sun they are guided to the moon, from  the  moon  they  are  guided
into the lightning. From the lightning  they  are  no  longer  guided  by  a
material demigod; but are then  guided  by  a  being  who  is  more  than  a
material being and this being escorts them unto  Brahma.  This  is  the  way
which leads to the celestials.
