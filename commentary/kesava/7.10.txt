Lord Krishna is revealing His glory as  the  <i>bijam</i>  or  permanent  seed  and
original cause of life in  all  creation,  woven  through  all  movable  and
immovable created beings and that this original seed  continues  manifesting
infinitely through all generations of the same species. He is the  <i>tejas</i>  or
valour of the valiant which allows them to be victorious  over  all  others.
He is the spiritual intelligence in the  form  of  spiritual  discriminative
power in the absence of which a human being is known as  an  animal.  It  is
stated in the Sanatsujata that: Humans without  spiritual  intelligence  are
equal to beasts.
