By abandoning this war for righteousness not  only  would  Arjuna  lose  his
excellent reputation but great misfortune would arise as well. This  is  the
gist of using the word akirtim meaning infamy. Instead of being the  valiant
warrior, Arjuna the weilder of the intrepid Gandiva  bow  has  become  timid
and fled the battlefield. Such undying infamy would spread by word of  mouth
throughout the world in many countries by those who witnessed  it.  But  not
only ksatriya warriors would speak ill of Arjuna but also demi-gods,  sages,
merchants and even low class sudras.  It  might  be  put  forth  that  isn't
infamy better than death? And that one should bear it instead of  dying.  In
the Mahabharata it is stated that one should try to  defeat  the  enemy  by:
negotiation, bribery, open attack, etc. but should not fight if  success  is
not guaranteed. In that case war should be avoided. To this Lord Krishna  is
responding that this infamy is more painful than  death?  Arjuna  has  never
been defeated in battle, he is the son of the king of the  demi-gods  Indra,
he is  the  dear  friend  of  Lord  Krishna,  he  possess  unrivaled  valor,
possessing extremely praiseworthy virtues with  this  understanding   infamy
is much more painful than death.
