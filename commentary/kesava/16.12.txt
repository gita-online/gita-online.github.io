Lord Krishna reveals  that  whatever  ritualistic  ceremonies  the  demoniac
execute is nothing more than a pretentious display  of  self-conceit.   They
make a big show so the public will think that they are pious.  Their  active
engagement looks on the outside as if it is correct but it is never  attuned
to devotion unto the Supreme Lord neither does it adhere to  the  ordinances
of the Vedic scriptures. This is inferred and made clear by the  descriptive
adjectives such as <i>sambhavitah</i> or conceited and  <i>stabdhah</i>  or  pompous.  The
demoniac possessing  arrogance  and  impertinence  due  to  intoxication  of
wealth make superficial rituals without  faith  and  void  of  righteousness
only for deceiving the public into regarding them as pious and  not  due  to
any spiritual pusuits.
