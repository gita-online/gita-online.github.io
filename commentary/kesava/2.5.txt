It may be further submitted that although Bhishma and Drona are both  always
to be respected, but as they  are  superiors  and  perceptors  to  both  the
Pandavas and the Kauravas they should all be looked after equally  regarding
aquisition and preservation. Why should Bhishma  and  Drona  fight  for  the
unlawful kingdom of the Kauravas on the side of the  wicked  Duryodhana?  It
appears that  being devoid of discrimination of  what  should  be  done  and
what should not be done have gone afoul of righteousness and thus  according
to Vedic scriptures have the right to be slain. Bishma  himself  has  stated
that a  superior   who  is  degraded  by  these  qualities  deserves  to  be
abandoned. To this Arjuna is replying that  refraining  from  slaying  great
souls it is better to live in this world by begging alms as by this  no  sin
will be incurred to reap in the next life. But if as Arjuna states they  are
great souls then how can they be degraded and if they are degraded  how  can
they be considered great souls and hence there abandonment  is  proper.  One
who is inferior  should normally never even think of abandoning a  preceptor
otherwise one will perish out of folly. But Bhisma's statement  that  a  man
is slave to wealth but  wealth  is  slave  to  no  man;  therefore   due  to
accepting wealth he was controlled by the  Kauravas.  So  this  proves  that
controlled by wealth and not righteousness and thus slaying them  incurs  no
sin. But to this Arjuna states that by slaying  elders  we  may  undoubtedly
enjoy some pleasures in this world but  these  pleasures  would  be  tainted
with blood as they are derived from the  sin of slaying superiors.
