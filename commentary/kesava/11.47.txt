Having promised in the verse before Lord Krishna now revealed His four
armed form adorned with golden crown, discus and mace and then as a further
consolation Lord Krishna, the repository of all divine attributes such as
majesty, omniscience, omnipotence, compassion etc. revealed His adorable
saumya-vapuh or gentle two-armed form decorated with turban, jewelery,
earrings and other ornaments which brought great relief to the suffering
Arjuna who was extremely agitated by the visvarupa or divine universal
form.
