Concluding this chapter Lord Krishna reveals a concise and  direct  form  of
worship that is possible for anyone. He begins with  <i>man  manas</i>  meaning  to
focus  one's  consciousness  upon  Lord  Krishna,  the  Supreme  Being,  the
Ultimate Reality, the Supreme Controller, the  Omniscient,  the  Omnipotent,
the all pervading One. Overflowing with all  auspicious  attributes,  devoid
of any defect, of indomitable will, the sole refuge for all,  the  veritable
source, origin and cause  of  all  creation,  who  is  always  of  fulfilled
desires, who bestows benedictions upon His devotees, and removes  all  their
defects. Whose transcendental form is the embodiment  of  eternity,  endless
knowledge and unlimited bliss as well as many  other  captivating  qualities
such as beauty, compassion, charm and sweetness. Who is able to attract  the
minds of the deep meditaters as well  as  capture  the  minds  of  even  the
<i>muktas</i> or liberated beings and  becomes  their  sole  object  of  meditation
thereafter.
<p>
One should endow their consciousness to flow incessantly to Lord Krishna  an
ocean  of  mercy  like  the  continuous  flow  of  the  river  Ganga   flows
incessantly to the ocean. This should be done with the  same  intensity  and
delight that a sensuous person has  while  enjoying  sensual  pleasures.  If
this is too difficult and  one  is  unable  to  detach  the  mind  from  the
innumerable objects seen, heard and experienced then Lord  Krishna  suggests
<i>mad bhakto</i> or worship Him in loving devotion. This means to perform  actions
of propitiation in the mood of <i>bhakti</i> or  loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme
Lord. In the Vedic scriptures it was told: O Narada whatever act of  worship
is enjoined in the Vedic scriptures regarding Lord Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorised  incarnations  and  expansions  known  as   <i>avatars</i>   should   be
enthusiastically performed as these very actions initiate the process  to  a
relationship of loving devotion with  the  Supreme  Lord.   Worshipping  the
Supreme Lord Krishna, being devoted to His worship,  adoring  His  Vedically
installed deity form every day  once,  twice,  thrice  or  many  times  with
Tulasi leaves, <i>pushpa</i> or various fragrant flowers, <i>dhupa or</i>  incense,  <i>dhipa</i>
or ghee lamps, <i>mala</i> or flower garlands,  beautiful  apparel  and  ornaments,
offering <i>bhoga</i> or vegetarian foods of  milk  products,  fruits,  grains  and
vegetables, chanting His names, singing His praises, revealing His  glories.
Fasting twice monthly on the sacred days of <i>Ekadasi</i> the 11th day before  the
new moon and full moon and fulfilling the <i>Ekadasi</i>  vow  of  refraining  from
all beans and grains for this day and if possible keeping  awake  all  night
in the ecstasy of communion with Lord Krishna.  Celebrating  His  appearance
days with festivals according to one's  means  and  availability  of  funds.
Acting out His glorious pastimes for others to see. The  feeding  of  guests
from the food offered to  Lord  Krishna  which  is  called  <i>mahapradam.</i>  The
playing of musical instruments in accompaniment to  singing  His  names  and
dancing in joy before  His  installed  deity  form.  Then  to  finalise  all
offerings and accomplish the  completion  of  all  propitiation  one  should
<i>namaskuru</i> or prostrate themselves fully in humble homage with  mind,  speech
and body before the installed deity form of  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations and expansions. The  act  of  <i>namaskuru</i>  effectively
neutralises any vestiges  of  egotism  which  could  manifest  as  pride  or
<i>pratistha</i> which is  subtle  desire  for  recognition  from  performing  such
wonderful activities to the Supreme Lord. One should abandon the feeling  of
pride and renounce the desire of recognition by dedicating all  actions  and
thoughts to the Supreme Lord and surrender them to the spiritual  master  in
disciplic succession to offer to the Supreme Lord.
<p>
The greatness of <i>namaskuru or</i> prostrating the full body  in  humble  hommage
before the Supreme Lord in humble  obeisance  is  explained  by  Prahlad  in
theVamana Purana stating: Properly bowing down to Vishnu  or  Sadashiva  who
both destroy the ocean of material existence one does not return to  <i>samsara</i>
the cycle of birth and death. In the Vaisnava Dharma is stated:  My  devotee
even though only speaking the words: I bow down to  the  Supreme  Lord  with
devotion and faith, attains the supreme destination. When one  has  achieved
the stage of lovingly performing propitiation and worship  of  Lord  Krishna
in their life it is very easy to fix their consciousness upon Him.  In  this
way uniting the consciousness with  Him  in  complete  communion,  depending
totally on Him exclusively, renouncing all other efforts and endeavours  one
shall assuredly attain His eternal  association  in  the  eternal  spiritual
worlds in one's individual spiritual body without a doubt.
<p>
I take complete and unconditional shelter  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's
devotion with its confidential instruction and  the  phenomenal  potency  of
the power of <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion.
