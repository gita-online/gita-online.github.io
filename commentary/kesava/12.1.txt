In the last verse of chapter 11 the prerequisite  method  of  attaining  the
Supreme Lord Krishna is revealed as <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion.  In
verse 20 of the eighth chapter Lord Krishna refers  to  the  innermost  self
the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul which is <i>avyaktah</i> or unmanifest  and  imperceptible
to eyes and other senses and any external  means  of  proof  except  by  the
Vedic scriptures. This <i>avyaktah</i> is of  a  superior  nature  far  beyond  the
<i>aksaram</i> or indestructible <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence. Continuing in verse 21 of chapter eight Lord Krishna states  that
the Vedic scriptures proclaim the <i>brahman</i> to be <i>paramam  gatim</i>  meaning  the
supreme destination.

Thus what can gained by achieving either of  the  two  goals  and  which  is
more appropriate is what is being  asked.  Of  the  two  ways  described  in
chapter 8 and  chapter  11  which  is  better?  Which  is  the  most  easily
achieved? What practitioners of which path are the best? With  a  desire  to
understand these things Arjuna requests Lord Krishna for clarification.  The
Supreme Lord's devotees have their  minds  constantly  fixed  on  Him.  They
adore His form, pastimes, attributes  and  qualities  such  as  omniscience,
omnipotence, infinite prowess, etc. Then there are those who  adore  as  the
supreme destination  the  abstract,  impersonal,  unmanifest  <i>brahman</i>  which
cannot be perceived by anything material such as the mind and senses.  Which
of the two practitioners following different paths are the most elevated  in
<i>yoga</i> or the science of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion
with the ultimate consciousness? They are called the most  elevated  because
they are <i>yoga-vittamah</i> meaning the best knowers of  <i>yoga</i>  and  because  they
know the best means for attaining the Supreme Lord they have achieved  <i>moksa</i>
or liberation from <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of birth and death.
