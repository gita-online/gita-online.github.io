Lord Krishna is speaking in this way to emphasise that the knowledge  He  is
prepared to reveal is very rarely achieved and difficult to acquire. Out  of
innumerable, countless souls some have attained  human  status  and  amongst
them hardly one in thousands of humans is qualified in Vedic scriptures  and
strives  for  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  soul.  Of  those   few
endeavouring for <i>atma tattva</i> hardly one in thousands  actually  achieves  it
and out of thousands who after having  achieved  <i>atma  tattva</i>e  and  finally
attained <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from  the  material  existence,  amongst  this
group some very rare personalities are  actually  aware  of  Lord  Krishna's
paramount position and divine glories in reality. This  is  because  without
<i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion unto Lord Krishna it is not possible to  know  and
perceive Him. This Lord  Krishna  confirms  Himself  at  the  conclusion  of
chapter eighteen, verse fifty-five  when  He  declares,  That  only  through
devotion does one come to the platform of communion with Him.
