Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form was exceedingly  difficult
to look at due to its blazing effulgence. This is also being stated  by  the
word <i>antaram</i> which is specifying that the <i>visvarupa</i> was manifest  in  heaven
and earth and all  the  space  in  between  meaning  between  the  celestial
spheres and all the universal planetary  systems.  This  verse  affirms  the
fearful omnipotent splendour that was also exhibited by  the  <i>visvarupa</i>  and
Lord Krishna's compassionate nature is  supplicated  upon  to  withdraw  His
frightful <i>visvarupa</i> because although it is phenomenally wonderful  and  awe-
inspiring, it is also terrifying and all the worlds are greatly alarmed  and
panic stricken upon witnessing it.
