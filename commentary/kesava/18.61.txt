The Supreme Lord Krishna reveals the secret with the instruction to fix  the
mind upon Him. Concentrate upon Him with one-pointed focused in  <i>bhakti</i>  or
exclusive loving devotion. This instruction is to be practically applied  by
dedicating all actions prescribed by the ordinances and injunctions  of  the
Vedic scriptures unto Him. Whatever prescribed Vedic  activitiy  offered  to
the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and
expansions as revealed in the Vedic scriptures is considered devotion  which
will lead  to  direct  communion  with  Him  eternally.  It  should  not  be
erroneously misconstrued that one can offer actions that are  prohibited  in
the Vedic scriptures as that would be inconscienable and  offensive.  It  is
seen that followers of Kali Ma offer meat to her in sacrifice; but  if  some
ignornant fool offered meat to Lord  Krishna  they  would  be  condemned  to
suffer in hellish condition for such a great offense as it is prohibited  to
offer Him at any time under any circumstances foods that are not  in  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of goodness and flesh from any source is always in  <i>tama  guna</i>
the mode of ignorance.
<p>
Worshipping the Supreme Lord exclusively by prescribed Vedic  activities  in
the form of offering material possessions,  or  in  the  form  of  executing
<i>tapah</i> or austerities or as simple as performing the  blessed  and  purifying
<i>Ekadasi vrata</i> which is  fasting  twice  a  month  from  all  grains  on  the
11th day of the waxing and waning moons and which grants unalloyed  devotion
to Lord Krishna.
<p>
For offering worship with material things  such  as  pure  cow  ghee,  gold,
silver, marble, etc. is possible only if one is wealthy; but even if one  is
poor Lord Krishna will happily accept a fruit, a flower or just  pure  water
from His devotees according to their capacity.  Offerings  in  the  form  of
austerities forebearing hunger and  thirst,  cold  and  heat,  etc.  in  the
natural  course  of  following  one's  own  prescribed  Vedic  duties.   The
offerings of <i>yoga</i> or facilitating communion with the Supreme  Lord  are  the
repitition of sacred mantras, exercises controlling  the  breath,  the  mind
and the senses along with <i>asanas</i> or postures. The offerings  of  wisdom  are
reciting and chanting the verses  of  the  Upanisads,  the  Puranas,  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita, Vishnu-Saharanama the  Thosand  Names  of  Vishnu,  etc.  The
offering of learning is studying and learning and for those  more  qualified
teaching the meaning and conclusion of the Vedic sciptures to others.
<p>
Now in order to avoid any complacency Lord Krishna instructs to bow down  to
Him with regularlity fully with all the eight limbs  of  the  body  touching
the ground for men. For women it should be only the knees,  head  and  hands
touching the ground as a womens breast should  never  touch  the  floor.  So
dedicated a devotee will advance by means of such devotion.  The  perfomance
of millions of ritualistic ceremonies cannot compare  to  the  results  Lord
Krishna's devotees receive from <i>bhakti.</i>  To  receive  the  full  result  one
should have concentrated devotion with undivided attention to  Lord  Krishna
alone. Although the Supreme Lord is extremely difficult to  propitiate  even
by  Brahma,  Shiva  and  the  demigods   who   often   consider   themselves
independent; but to His surrendered devotees He is so easy  to  please  that
even with only fresh water He is  amply  satified  if  it  is  offered  with
devotion.
<p>
After investigating and  scrutinising  the  Vedic  scripture  intensely  and
reflecting and pondering over them repeatedly  the  consensus  concluded  by
the wise and sagacious  is  that  one  should  concentrate  their  mind  and
energies on meditating on the <i>nama</i> or name, <i>rupa</i> or form, <i>guna</i> or  qualities
and  <i>lila</i>  or  divine  pastimes  of  the  Supreme   Lord   Krishna.   Always
remembering Him and  never  forgetting  Him  attain  immortality.  The  sage
Medhavi stated in Moksa Dharma: I am that enlightened  person,  non-violent,
true to the self, with senses  controlled,  free  from  passion  and  anger,
equipoised and tranquil and in this way I  shall  overcome  death  like  the
immortals. Undoubtedly one should  abandon  anything  internal  or  external
which causes attachment in the mind and distracts it from meditating   fully
on the Supreme Lord and remain blissfully absorbed in this state  until  the
final moment of death. The <i>muktas</i> or liberated souls who have achieved  this
state while still alive have declared that if one can control  the  mind  in
this way after some time it locks and one is free  to  establish  themselves
in  the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  within  the  etheric  heart  which  gives
liberation granting direct communion with the Supreme Lord.
<p>
The misguided and malicious atheists of mundane  intelligence  and  degraded
impulses, such deluded living entities are unable to behold  the  wide  open
gateway to <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence  that  is  accessible
to all humanity.  All  their  endeavours  and  attempts  to  understand  the
inconceivable is for  them  in  vain  because  they  have  eternally  cursed
themselved for denying the existence of the  magnanimous  and  compassionate
almighty Supreme Lord.
