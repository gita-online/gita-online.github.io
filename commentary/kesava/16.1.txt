In the thirteenth chapter it was revealed that <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving
devotion to the Supreme Lord  Krishna  is  the  topmost  way  to  inevitably
achieve <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from  material  existence  by  the  guaranteed
attainment of the Supreme Lord. Also it was disclosed that knowledge of  the
<i>atma</i> or immortal soul is true knowledge of the <i>ksetrajna</i> or  knower  of  the
field of activity and that the contact of the <i>gunas</i> or the  three  modes  of
material nature which are goodness, passion and ignorance keep one  enslaved
in the transmigratory disease of <i>samsara</i> or the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth
and death.
<p>
In chapter 14 was explained the characteristics of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  along
with their attributes and the types of bondage associated with each as  well
as the conclusion that by transcending them one achieves the  supreme  state
of consciousness.
<p>
In chapter 15 was described the destruction of the tree of material  bondage
with the weapon of wisdom sharpened by detachment. The  knowledge  that  all
<i>jivas</i> or embodied beings whether in bondage or liberated  are  both  aspects
of the Supreme Lord.  The sun and fire, etc. are the  Supreme  Lords  divine
opulence.  The  Supreme  Lord  is  beyond  both  the  perishable   and   the
imperishable and  one  who  realises  His  transcendence  and  His  supreme,
paramount  position   surrenders   joyfully   as   His   exclusive   devotee
understanding all that needs to be known and becomes completely satisfied.
<p>
Now in order to establish  the  criteria  for  determining  which  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings are appropriate to receive  the  confidential  and  esoteric
teachings presented in chapter  15,  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  elaborates
first on the qualities of the divine nature and then  on  the  qualities  of
the demoniac nature in order  to  enable  a  clear  ability  to  distinguish
between them both. Previously in chapter nine He has  alluded  to  those  of
demoniac nature in  verse  11:  The  ignorant  blaspheme  the  Supreme  Lord
considering Him to be only human and in verse 12: Ignorant fools so  deluded
become atheists and adopt the fiendish mentality of the  demoniac.  Also  in
chapter nine Lord Krishna referred to those of divine nature  in  verse  13:
The great souls devote themselves exclusively unto the Supreme Lord  knowing
He is the eternal origin of all, belong to the divine nature  and  in  verse
14: Endeavouring  with  great  determination  the  great  souls  perpetually
worship the Supreme Lord with exclusive loving devotion.
<p>
As such the conclusion is apparent and clear that  demoniac  influences  are
to be rejected and divine endowments are  to  be  cultivated.  The  demoniac
mentality is the root cause of  perpetual  hellish  conditions  in  material
existence and should  be  completely  abandoned  and  avoided.  Whereas  the
divine qualities are the root cause of <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence and should be wholeheartedly embraced.
<p>
Now Lord Krishna describes the divine qualities which  are  prerequisite  to
qualify for  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord
beginning with absolute fearlessness meaning  completely  unworried  by  the
apprehension of present or future miseries.  Total  purity  of  heart  means
free from passion and hatred. Constant absorption of the mind in  meditation
means established is self-realisation. <i>Danam</i> or charity  is  donating  to  a
worthy recipient what has been gained honestly by one's own  efforts.  <i>Damah</i>
is control of the  senses,  withdrawing  the  mind  from  the  outward  flow
towards sense objects. <i>Yagna</i> is propitiation and ritualistic worship of  the
Supreme Lord in  the  form  of  chanting  mantras,  learning  the  Vedas  or
performing fire ceremonies as given  in  chapter  three,  verses13  and  14.
<i>Svadahyah</i> is study of the Vedas by receiving confidential instructions  from
the spiritual master concerning the glories of the names,  divine  pastimes,
attributes, and associates of the Supreme Lord and His eternal abode.  <i>Tapah</i>
is penance and is the practice of  pure  austerities  such  as  fasting  and
meditation. <i>Arjavam</i> is the simplicity of not being complicated in  mind  and
dealings. <i>Ahimsa</i> is non-violence to any living entity by  thought,  word  or
action. An exception to this is in the protection of one's own life and  the
lives of others. <i>Satyam</i> is truthfulness and means not distorting  the  facts
while speaking plainly what is beneficial  for  others.  <i>Akrodah</i>  means  the
absence of anger which is a result of frustrated greed and lust.  <i>Tyagah</i>  is
renunciation or absence of attachment  to  the  senses  and  sense  objects.
<i>Santih</i> is  complete  tranquillity  and  control  of  the  mind  and  senses.
<i>Apaisanunam</i> is abstaining from malicious gossip and fault finding.  <i>Daya</i>  is
mercy and compassion to all living entities. <i>Aloluptvam</i> means  freedom  from
avarice and greed. The addition of the <i>p</i> to this word is in accordance  with
the Vedic rules of grammar by Panini. <i>Hrih</i> is modesty or respectful  decorum
for righteousness, a sense of indecency in performing  frivolous  activities
and a feeling of shame at the thought of prohibited activities. <i>Acapalam</i>  is
determination unshakable fortitude even in adversity. <i>Tejah</i>  means  strength
or the power to aid  those  needing  protection.  <i>Saucam</i>  means  cleanliness
internal and external. <i>Ksama</i> is forgiveness amd means the absence  of  anger
towards one's offenders. <i>Natimanita</i> is lack of  all  desire  for  honor  and
prestige. So these qualities can be recognised  as  naturally  endowed  with
divine  virtues  and  attributes.  Those  who   embrace   and   follow   the
instructions and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures are  naturally  endowed
with these qualities as they are adhering to the Supreme Lord's decrees  and
thus every action they perform is in propitiation to the Lord Krishna.   
<p>
The conclusive understanding is that those possessing divine qualities  will
undoubtedly achieve the Supreme state because they  are  born  endowed  with
these qualities.
