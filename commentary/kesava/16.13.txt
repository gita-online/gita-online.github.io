The demoniac form of worship is completely contrary to the  injunctions  and
ordinances of the Vedic scriptures. This is because as previously  described
the demoniac mentality and degraded activities are  only  based  upon  their
bodily conception and false ego. The demoniac  think  that  they  are  their
physical body possessed of five senses and cannot imagine that  there  is  a
difference.  The  demoniac  are  vile,  malicious,  cruel,  belligerent  and
insolent.  They  enjoy  finding  faults  in  everything  righteous  and   in
subverting the virtues and attributes of the pious.  Although  the  demoniac
possess no righteous qualities themselves  they  still  consider  themselves
superior and cannot tolerate insults. The demoniac are  full  of  anger  and
will not hesitate to use brutal force to maim  and  kill  others.  They  are
inextricably addicted to  lust,  greed  and  sense  gratification  and  when
opposed by obstacles the demoniac become enraged causing  intense  agony  to
others as well as to their own selves and by this disregard, disrespect  and
displease the Supreme Lord Krishna who abides  within  their  etheric  heart
and the etheric heart of all sentient beings as  the  innermost  witness  of
all their thoughts and  actions.  The  demoniac  spitefully  transgress  the
ordinances and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and  insidiously  attempt
to destroy the  fundamental  principles  of  creation  established  for  the
benefit of all living entities and do everything  in  their  power  to  drag
humanity down to their immoral, depraved and  degraded  level  of  existence
directedly straight to hell.
