It could be feasible that Lord Krishna might ask Arjuna why is he asking  to
repeat what was told already in VII.VIII that He is  the  flavour  in  water
and  in  IX:IV  that  everything  in  creation  is  permeated  by  Him.  The
7th chapter reveals some of His divine  glories  and  the  9th  chapter  His
Supreme Power. Earlier in this chapter verse VIII it is revealed  that  Lord
Krishna is the Supreme Absolute Truth and the origin of  everything  animate
and inanimate. What Lord Krishna spoke of  previously  was  to  concise  and
brief. Because of this Arjuna speaks the compound word <i>vistarenatmano  yogam</i>
meaning explain in detail  the  process  of  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness of  Lord  Krishna.  Arjuna  is  feeling  that  Lord  Krishna's
unequivocal instructions are just like  ambrosial  nectar  and  to  hear  in
detail about the power of His glorious  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine,  transcendental
opulence along with His eternal power of <i>yoga</i> just increases this  ambrosial
nectar.
