Now Lord Krishna reiterates the duties of the <i>vaisyas</i> the farmer  mercantile
class. Cow raising and cow protecting, tilling the land for  crops,  trading
and selling for business are the duities of <i>vaisyas.</i> Industrious service  to
the other three classes for fair  recompense  is  the  duty  of  <i>sudras</i>  the
worker class.
<p>
The Manu Samhita, chapter one,verses  88-91  confirm:  Study  of  the  Vedic
scriptures, teaching of the  Vedic  scriptures,  performing  Vedic  rituals,
officiating  as  priests  for  <i>ksatriyas</i>  and  <i>vaisyas</i>  initiated  in  Vedic
culture, giving gifts and accepting donations are the  duties  of  Brahmins.
Protection of the citizenry, supporting and organising Vedic rituals,  study
of the Vedic scriptures, righteousness in ruling  and  giving  donations  to
the Brahmin are the duties of <i>ksatriyas.</i> Protecting  and  raising  of  cows,
study of the Vedas, agriculture, gift making, buying and trading are  duties
of <i>vaisyas.</i> Only one service was ordained for <i>sudras</i> the  worker  class  and
that was to ungrudgingly serve the three upper social orders.
<p>
The qualities of controlling the mind and senses, physical restraint of  the
body,  etc.  are  commonly  prescribed  for  all  aspirants  of   <i>moksa</i>   or
liberation, they are naturally present in Brahmins due to  being  inherently
predominated by <i>sattva guna.</i> The Vedic scriptures cite examples that  others
due to <i>samskaras</i> or previous impressions may  also  be  situated  in  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i>  as  well  if  possessing  truthfulness,   forgiveness,   non-violence,
humility, etc. and the various qualities of <i>sattva guna.</i> This is apparent.
