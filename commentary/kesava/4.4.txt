Although  Arjuna  had  experienced  many  wonderful  and  divine  <i>lila's</i>  or
pastimes with Lord Krishna still  he  could  understand  that  it  would  be
difficult for others to fathom the reality of His teaching  the  demigod  of
the sun Visvavan 120 million years previous. So Arjuna posed  this  question
for Lord Krishna who is <i>isvara</i> or the Ultimate Controller and Supreme  Ruler
of all creation, time and action. He  alone  is  the  ultimate  reality  and
highest destination who incarnated in the family of  Vasudeva  in  order  to
remove the speculations of those whose minds were made  impure  by  tendency
to sinful activities as well as to eradicate the demoniac  elements  present
who were polluting the Earth. The question was asked so Lord  Krishna  could
confirm the truth Himself regarding His transcendental appearance and supra-
mundane phenomenal exploits that the miscreants and non-believers refuse  to
except as being possible for the Supreme Lord. By  answering  this  question
all doubts would be cleared up about Lord Krishna's supreme position.
