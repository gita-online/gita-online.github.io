The supposition that the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul is said to be  the  cause  of
experiencing pleasure and pain is erroneous and untenable because  the  <i>atma</i>
is  completely  spiritual  and  the  epitome  of  knowledge.  Although   the
intrinsic nature of the <i>atma</i>  is  immutable  and  eternally  blissful,  Lord
Krishna clarifies here that when the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being is engrossed  in
experiencing objects of material nature  from  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  being  the
modes of goodness, passion and ignorance; then  various  modification  arise
due to the <i>karma</i> or reactions to the actions which are performed and is  the
definitive cause of the <i>jiva</i> being born in exalted or degraded wombs in  any
of the 8 million 400 thousand different species that  exist  throughout  the
material creation. The exalted wombs such as those  born  of  the  demi-gods
are attuned in the mode of goodness. The degraded wombs such as  those  born
of the demons are attuned to the qualities of ignorance. The mixed wombs  of
exalted and degraded such as  those  born  of  humans  are  attuned  to  the
qualities of activity and passion.  The  higher  being  the  Vaisnava's  and
Brahmanas and the lower being the <i>sudras</i> the lower class and below them  the
degraded are the  <i>mleechas</i>  or  the  meateaters  and  the  <i>candalas</i>  or  the
uncleansed. The animals  regardless  of  intelligence  are  attuned  to  the
instincts of their species in the mode  of  nescience.  The  consequence  of
experiencing any of these wombs is  due  solely  to  the  <i>jiva</i>  continuously
attempting to exploit and enjoy material nature  and  the  subsequent  <i>karma</i>
derived from  such  activities.  The  most  powerful  cause  is  the  mental
attachment anticipating the pleasure of enjoying the sense objects of  touch
and taste and form etc. and the  incessant  manoeuvres  for  achieving  such
desires. Thus the <i>atma</i> residing  within  the  <i>jiva</i>  who  is  bewildered  and
beguiled by material nature is subjected to  transmigration  perpetually  in
the wombs of higher and lower species performing  activities  which  accrues
<i>karma</i> and is incessantly born and reborn  indefinitely.  The  conclusion  is
that the <i>atma</i> experiences a demotion by the cycles of birth  and  death  and
until renunciation  and  detachment  arises  and  the  desire  for  material
enjoyment is abandoned and the  heart  is  made  pure  by  <i>bhakti</i>  or  pure,
exclusive devotion to the Supreme Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  his  Vedically
authorised incarnations, the <i>atma</i> will not be able to  be  realised  by  the
<i>jiva</i> and achieve freedom from <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and
death.
