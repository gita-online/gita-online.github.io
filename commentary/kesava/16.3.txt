Lord Krishna explains the opposing results of  the  divine  nature  and  the
demoniac  nature.  The  divine  nature  which  follows  the  ordinances  and
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures has been regarded from  time  immemorial
by self-realised sages and rishis as conducive to <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from
material existence due to spiritual knowledge and attaining  communion  with
the Supreme Lord. The demoniac nature leads one to  act  contrarily  to  the
ordinances and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and hence  are  conducive
to enslavement in <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death  and
bondage in material existence taking birth  each  time  in  lower  and  more
degraded life forms. Seeing despondency on His devotees face,  Lord  Krishna
assures him not to worry for he is  without  a  doubt  born  of  the  divine
nature.
