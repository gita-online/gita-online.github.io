This <i>avyakta</i> or unmanifest is beyond the perception of the mind  and  senses
and is <i>aksara</i> or  indestructible  and  contains  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. In the second chapter  it  was  revealed
that the <i>atma</i> or soul is indestructible as well. But <i>aksara</i>    is  known  by
those knowledgeable of the Vedic scriptures to  be  paramount,  higher  than
the  <i>atma,</i>  the  goal  of  the  <i>atma</i>  as  verified  in  the  Katha  Upanisad
I.II.XXIII: That the realised eternal soul is the Supreme Lords  abode.  The
unrealised soul  tainted  by  association  with  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material
substratum pervading physical existence. But His presence as the witness  in
the hearts of all living beings is to keep them  always  connected  to  Him,
for the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad III:VII,XXII states: The Supreme  Being  has
established Himself in the heart of all living entities. The same  scripture
in III.III.VII states: That <i>paramatma</i> the supreme soul which resides in  the
heart of all living entities  is  different  from  the  individual  <i>atma</i>  or
soul; yet the <i>atma</i> knows Hin not, He whose abode is  the  <i>atma.</i>  It  is  the
Supreme Lord who is installed in the hearts of all beings as the witness  of
all thoughts and actions. Attaining Him the individual <i>atma</i>  is  permanently
divested of <i>prakriti</i> and they never return to the worlds of mortals  as  the
cycle of birth and death is terminated. The purport is that <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul is very exalted but the  <i>paramam  gatim</i>  or  supreme
goal is to attain the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  in  His  <i>dhama</i>  or  abode  and
associate eternally with Him.
