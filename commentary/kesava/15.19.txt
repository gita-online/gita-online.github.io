Thus in this chapter the Supreme Lord Krishna summarised the import  of  the
Vedas, the Puranas and all Vedic scriptures.  Extolling  this  sacred  topic
which He expanded upon in a concise way as the confidential  secret  of  all
secrets in the revelation of His aspect of <i>Purusottama</i>  the  Supreme  Being.
Simultaneously He has also given a gloss in an abridged form of the  essence
of the complete Bhagavad-Gita. In conclusion he has declared that those  who
have  embraced  this  knowledge  will  become  spiritually  enlightened  and
achieve  their  topmost  well  being.  They   have   actually   accomplished
everything they needed to accomplish because after attaining  the  knowledge
of Lord Krishna as the absolute Supreme Being there is nothing left  needing
to be accomplished. The vocative <i>Bharata</i> referring to  Arjuna's  illustrious
heritage implies that he as His devotee  will  surely  attain  these  things
without fail and that not only he but anyone not inimical  to  Lord  Krishna
who embraces this knowledge can become  spiritually  enlightened  and  fully
satisfied as well.
<p>
I take full refuge in the Supreme Lord Krishna, He who is  the  most  worthy
of knowing and the goal of the Vedas, who  in  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  became
the spiritual master and taught the conclusions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures.
Who is totally different and distinct from both <i>ksarah</i>  the  perishable  and
<i>aksarah</i>  the  imperishable  being  transcendental  to  them  although   both
originate from Him. He  is  omnipotent,  ominisicent  and  omni-present  and
whose divine opulences such as trillions of luminous suns are unlimited.
