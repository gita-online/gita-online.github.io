Lord Krishna states that if death comes upon a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being  while
predisposed to <i>raja guna</i> or the mode of passion then one  takes  birth  next
from those who are obsessed to perform actions in anticipation of rewards  .
Also a <i>jiva</i> dying while  under  the  influence  of  <i>tama  guna</i>  or  mode  of
ignorance is forced to take birth as an animal in the next life.
