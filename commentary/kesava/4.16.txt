Arjuna might be thinking that if everyone  has  to  perform  actions  anyway
then he will do it because the Lord advised it so; but he  may  have  doubts
about his ability to perform actions in the manner  that  was  performed  by
the great beings of yore. To clarify this Lord Krishna  confirms  that  even
those of discrimination and intelligence are bewildered  by  the  subtleties
of action and inaction. The actions performed by an aspirant  for  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation are completely different from those  seeking  rewards  for  their
actions. Because the intricacies of action and  inaction  are  difficult  to
comprehend Lord Krishna now promises to explain it  definitively,  therefore
by knowing and performing actions  properly  one  will  be  freed  from  the
disease of materialism which binds one  tightly  to  <i>samsara</i>  the  cycle  of
birth and death.
