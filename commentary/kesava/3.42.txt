Lord Krishna explains the priority of  the  facultiesâ  humans
possess starting from the physical body to the senses  to  the
mind to the intellect to the atma  or  soul.  The  senses  are
superior to the  physical  body  because  if  the  senses  are
agitated they will transfer this  agitation  to  the  physical
body and knowledge will not arise in the  mind.  The  mind  is
superior to the senses and can stop them but if  the  mind  is
intent on sense gratification then knowledge will  not  arise.
The intellect is superior to the senses and the  mind  but  if
the senses are passive and the mind is not agitated;  then  if
the intellect decides contrary and is inclined  to  enjoy,  it
will overrule the senses and the mind and directs them both to
pursue pleasure. So knowledge will not arise there as well but
when the senses are withdrawn  from  the  sense  objects  this
impulse subsides. So what is more powerful then the intellect?
We see that it is kama or lust  that  is  greater.  All  these
things happen in regard to physical activity. The mind becomes
clouded and the intellect is obscured by kama and reflects and
contemplates actions that will gratify the senses veiling  the
true knowlegde of the atma. This confirms  that  kama  is  the
greatest  enemy  of  the  human  being  because  it   obscures
knowledge of the eternal atma or soul.
