The Supreme Lord Krishna is prime cause of all causes. The most  ancient  of
all. The origin of all the  demigods  and  every  other  kind  of  god.  The
ultimate refuge of creation and all universes because He  is  the  <i>visvarupa</i>
the divine universal form. He is the knower of everything and  the  goal  of
everything knowable. He is the highest abode known as the  spiritual  realms
of <i>Vaikuntha</i> and He is  beyond  that.  The  whole  manifest  and  unmanifest
creation is pervaded by Him.  Because  of  all  these  things  Lord  Krishna
deserves glorification and salutations from everyone in all creation.
