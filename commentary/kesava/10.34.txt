Among those practising fraud to deceive others Lord Krishna's vibhuti or
divine, transcendental opulence is dyutam or gambling. His vibhuti is the
glory of the glorious, the victory of the victorious, the diligence of the
diligent and the sattvam or goodness meaning pious conduct of the righteous
characterised by knowledge and dispassion.
