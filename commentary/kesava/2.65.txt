In order to strengthen the previous verse Lord Krishna points  out  all  the
contrary results incurred by one with an uncontrolled mind. One who has  not
subdued their senses by controlling their mind is  bereft  of  determinative
resolve. The intellect of one with  spiritual  intelligence  determines  the
truth ascertained in the  Vedic  scriptures.  It  is  not  possible  for  an
undisciplined living entity to have  belief  of  the  calibre  necessary  to
contemplate  matters  relating  to  the  ultimate  truth.   Without   having
understanding of God there is no peace and also no  end  to  attachment  for
sensual objects. How can there possibly  be  permanent  happiness  which  is
inexhaustible and unaffected not in the least by sorrow if  one  is  lacking
peace  of  mind.   Although  material  happiness  is   surely   derived   by
experiencing  worldly  objects,  the  deceptive  results  of  this  perilous
interaction is very succinctly summed up subsequently  in verse  38  of  the
final chapter of Bhagavad-Gita.
