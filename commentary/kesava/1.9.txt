The question may be raised are these the only warriors on Duryodhanas  side.
In this verse that question is answered  by  the  words  <i>anye</i>  meaning  many
others, others like Jayadratha and Salya and Krtavarma who are all ready  to
lay down their lives for him. If it were to  be  further  questioned  as  to
their capability, this would be verified by 2 descriptive  adjectives  <i>nana-</i>
<i>sastra-praharanah</i> meaning they are equipped with various  missles  as  their
weapons and  <i>yuddha-visarada</i>  meaning  they  are  expert  in  all  forms  of
military science.
