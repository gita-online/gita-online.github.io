It might be asked that since the attributes and potencies  manifesting  from
the Supreme Lord Krishna are His eternal portions; then why  does  the  <i>atma</i>
or immortal soul which also manifests from Him and  is  an  eternal  portion
subject  to  the  forced  incarceration  of  transmigration.  Lord   Krishna
clarifies this point by stating that finite reflections cannot be proved  of
having eternality neither that they are  beginningless  .  This  is  because
they are generated due to accessories and adjuncts such as water  reflecting
the sunlight. The sun is always present but it may  be  obscured  by  clouds
and then again there is no reflection at all during night. Because  the  sun
is perceived externally by reflection it is known to exist  but  to  peceive
the <i>atma</i> in its eternal state it must be perceived internally. In  this  way
due to limitations of the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being, there are some  conditions
which cannot be seen, experienced or perceived  attached  to  realising  the
<i>atmas</i> eternality which is beyond the purview of the mind  and  senses.  Thus
the <i>atma</i> cannot be proved by reflection. One in nescience and  ignorance  by
the obscuration of knowledge is  unable  to  ever  understand  the  <i>atma</i>  or
comprehend its infinite nature; so  how  can  one  imagine  its  reflection.
Contrarily if the finite nature of the  <i>atma</i>  is  accepted  the  <i>atma</i>  still
cannot be proved  as  a  reflection  because  of  the  established  doctrine
confirmed in the Mundaka Upanisad III.I.IX beginning:  <i>eso  anuratma  cetasi</i>
<i>veditavyo</i> meaning: The <i>atma</i> or immortal soul is infinitesimal and  difficult
to  realise  but  when  one  achieves  spiritual  enlightenment   by   self-
realisation the <i>atma</i> shines within  the  etheric  heart.  Also  the  Vedanta
Sutras II.III.XVIII beginning <i>utcranti gat yagatinam</i>  states:  The  <i>atma</i>  is
infintesimal, sub-atomic and able to pass in and  out  from  body  to  body.
Also in II.III.XXII beginning <i>guna dva lokavat</i> meaning: The <i>atma</i> resides  in
the heart but by its potency of consciousness pervades  all  the  body  like
candle light pervading a room. So although the individual  soul  is  eternal
it is infintesimal; but <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme  soul  is  eternal,  unlimited
and infinite.
<p>
The conclusion is that if an adjunct is infinite it  can  not  be  reflected
because it is beyond perception. Thus any conception of  the  <i>atma</i>  being  a
reflecion of the Supreme Lord is illusion and would be like considering  the
suns rays to be a reflection of the sun.  Such  ideas  and  conceptions  are
false and  delusory  and  contradict  Vedic  scriptures.  So  whenever  Lord
Krishna speaks of His portion or His potency, it always  denotes  eternality
as  every  part  of  Him  is  eternal  and  is  not  a  seperate  entity  or
consciousness. Lord Krishna already declared in chapter 7, verse 5  that  he
has an internal and external nature. Although the  power  and  the  powerful
appear as seperate energies they cannot  exist  independent  of  each  other
even though eternally exemplifying unity in diversity  as  is  evidenced  by
the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being, which is confined to inhaling air  or  water  as
the case may be in various organisms. The <i>jiva</i> has been  bewildered  by  the
latent  tendncy  of  enjoying  sense  objects  since  time  immemorial   and
subsequently ensnared by their actions to the law of <i>karma</i> or  reactions  to
actions from such material enjoyment and exploitation  by  the  five  senses
which awards every <i>jiva</i> the appropriate body  to  inhabit  corresponding  to
what one eats and what reactions one has acquired in te form of  the  effect
called the indivual flase ego.
<p>
Those not fully situated in spiritual knowledge have the  opinion  that  the
<i>atma</i> is the highest self and  that  it  only  appears  limited  due  to  the
covering of nescience which is like ether  appearing limited in  a  pitcher.
When the limiting adjuncts are no longer in contact  with  each  other  then
the ether is perceived without limitations and in  the  same  way  when  the
adjunct of nescience is removed the true nature of  the  <i>atma</i>  is  revealed.
But this supposition is directly refuted in this verse by the word  <i>sanatana</i>
meaning eternal because it is a part of Lord Krishna. The singular usage  of
the compound words <i>jiva-bhuta</i> refers to the category of  <i>jiva</i>  and  includes
all <i>jivas</i> in every dimension throughout all creation.
