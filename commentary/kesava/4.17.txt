Action is generally understood to be the activity of  the  body  and  senses
while inaction  is  the  opposite  of  this.  How  is  it  that  those  with
discrimination and intelligence are bewildered by this? The true  nature  of
action must be known as well as the real nature of inaction  which  includes
the non-performance of prohibited actions. For the  intricacies  of  action,
sinful action and  prohibited  actions  are  mysterious  and  not  generally
known.  The use in the genitive sense of the word  <i>karmano</i>  meaning  actions
infers  the  mysterious  characteristics  of  the  true  nature  of  action,
inaction and prohibited actions.
