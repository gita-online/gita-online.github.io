Lord  Krishna  explains  that  one   endowed   with   spiritually   purified
intelligence  is  naturally  predominated  with  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of
goodness.  The  classification  of  higher  and  lower  living  entities  is
determined by the degree in which the mind is controlled and the senses  are
restrained. The mind is controlled by not indulging in positive or  negative
thoughts and  illusory  conceptions  and  the  control  of  the  senses  is
neutrality  towards  them  without  aversion  or  attraction  towards  their
objects. By living in pure and remote place, exercising a light,  vegetarian
diet, moderation of speech, mind and body, three times daily  meditating  on
the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord morning, noon and evening in  full
dispassion, completely eradicating all egoism and conceptions  that  one  is
the  physical  body.  Lack  of  craving  bodily  sense   gratification   and
soliciting  pleasure  of  the  senses,   absence   of   amassing   excessive
possessions and freedom from mental disturbances  bestows  the  tranquillity
and peace of  mind  to  qualify  an  aspirant  to  realise  the  <i>brahman</i>  or
spiritual substratum pervading  al  existence  which  is  transcendental  to
material  nature  and  situated  on  the  spiritual  platform  is  pure  and
impeccable without any defect or blemish.
