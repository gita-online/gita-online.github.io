Lord Krishna has thus pointed out the  virtues  of  performing
yagna or worship according to the Vedic  injunctions  and  the
demerits incurred  by  ignoring  the  Vedic  prohibitions  and
failing to perform yagna. He points  out  the  folly  of  non-
performance of yagna in verses 14, 15 and 16  beginning  annad
bhananti meaning food strengthens living  beings.  All  beings
have evolved from and waxed strong from foods.  Production  of
food is dependent on rain and rain is dependent on yagna which
is dependent upon the activities performed by the Brahmins  as
prescribed in the Vedas. This is the chanting of Vedic mantras
by Brahmins and their offering the oblations such as  ghee  or
clarified butter and seed grain such as sesame into the sacred
fire. In Manu Samhita III.76 it has been presented in  another
way: the oblations offered into the fire ascend  to  the  sun,
from the sun comes clouds and  rain,  from  rainfall  food  is
grown and from food beings come into existence.
