So the one performing actions without attachment is  the  best
even the married householder who gradually through his actions
controls his mind and senses is far superior to such  a  false
renunciate. By diverting the  senses  from  sense  objects  by
control of the mind one becomes eligible for contemplation  of
the self which when unattached to  the  desire  for  anything,
gradually leads one to be qualified for meditation on the atma
or soul. So it is clear that the discipline of karma yoga  the
practice  of  selfless  actions  is  essential  for  spiritual
development.
