Lord Krishna confirms the authenticity of the previous described  <i>yagnas</i>  or
offerings of worship as being sanctioned by  the  Vedic  scriptures  by  the
word <i>evam</i> meaning of this kind and the different types have  been  explained
in  detail  in  the  <i>parampara</i>  or  disciplic  succession  and   have   been
transmitted from spiritual master  to  disciple  in  the  tradition  of  the
Vedic culture. All of the before mentioned <i>yagnas</i> are performed by mind,  by
speech or by the physical body but their actions are of a transitory  nature
and the <i>atma</i> or soul is eternal. So these  actions  and  the  <i>atma</i>  are  not
invariably connected. Thus comprehending this in reality one  will  be  free
from <i>samsara</i>  the cycle of birth and death caused by actions.
