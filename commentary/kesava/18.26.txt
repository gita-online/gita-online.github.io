One who is attached to actions due to craving for rewards, who  is  impelled
by  sense  gratification,  who  is  envious  of  others,  who   is   greedy,
unrighteous and prone to cruelty from an oppressive  nature  inhibiting  the
welfare of others. Who is joyful gaining benefit but sorrowful at  incurring
loss. Such a one is undeniably situated in <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion.
