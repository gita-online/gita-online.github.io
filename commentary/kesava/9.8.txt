Lord  Krishna  clarifies  his  position  with  the  words   <i>prakritim   svam</i>
<i>avastabhya</i> or reflecting upon His external energy  the  material  substratum
pervading all existence constituted  of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  being  goodness,
passion and ignorance. Although insentient, <i>prakriti</i> is fully  competent  to
transform all the diverse and variegated beings as a  total  aggregate  into
their respective forms as designated by their <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  to  past
life activities. The eight-fold  principle  transformations  of  conception,
birth up to old age and death etc. are directed by the Supreme Lord  and  is
manifested again and again after every dissolution of creation inclusive  of
all sentient beings being demigods, humans, animals and  plants.  None  from
the highest demigod to the lowest blade of grass are independent.  They  are
all compelled to  accept  the  form  conscripted  upon  them  due  to  their
individual natures in accordance with the respective reactions derived  from
their previous activities
