Lord Krishna is making the point that when one does not comprehend that  all
actions are impelled by the body, mind and senses due to  the  influence  of
<i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical  existence  and
perceives different living entities and who assume that  the  performers  of
good and evil actions are  separate  from  the  Supreme  Lord;  then  it  is
impossible to realise the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul within  the  etheric  heart.
All actions are due to <i>prakriti</i> which is transformed into the body and  from
which all physical activity depends  upon  to  perform  actions  and  fulfil
desires through the medium of the senses. For the <i>atma</i> this does  not  apply
having no material qualities  or  material  attributes  it  is  the  witness
monitoring all thought and activities of every <i>jiva</i> or embodied being.
