Now the austerities of the mind are given by  Lord  Krishna  beginning  with
<i>manah-prasada</i> or tranquillity due to self satisfaction.  Mental  purity  due
to the absence of lust, anger and greed. Silence  is  avoidance  of  useless
mundane  conversations.  Self-control  is  directing  the  mind  away   from
unrighteous activities and focusing it on spiritual  activities.  Purity  of
heart is freedom from hankerings and desires for  sense  gratification.  All
these constitute austerities of speech in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
