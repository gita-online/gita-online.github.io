Lord Krishna elaborates on the many aspects of His diversity in  this  verse
and the next three. He states that He is <i>Kratu</i> or Vedic  rituals,  <i>Yagna</i>  or
Vedic offerings, <i>Sraddha</i> or  Vedic  oblations  to  the  departed  ancestors,
<i>asudham</i> or the potency of the medicinal healing  herb,  the  <i>mantra</i>  or  the
sacred Sanskrit chant of invocation recited by duly bonafide  Brahmins  from
one of the four authorised <i>sampradayas</i> or lines of disciplic succession.  He
is also <i>aijam</i> or <i>ghee</i> which is clarified butter  exclusively  from  the  cow
which without no Vedic <i>yagna</i> can  be  authentically  performed.  He  is  the
<i>Ahavaniya</i> fire which is ignited from the consecrated fire and He is the  act
of offering the oblations into the fire and the ritual itself.
