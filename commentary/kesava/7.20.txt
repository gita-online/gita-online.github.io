So previously Lord Krishna revealed just how rare and  difficult  it  is  to
meet an enlightened <i>jnani</i> or knower of God among the four virtuous types  of
beings. He also deliberated  on  the  other  three  types  being  <i>artto</i>  the
afflicted, <i>jijnasur</i> the seekers of liberation and <i>artharthi</i> the  seekers  of
wealth and how when gradually becoming free from desire and attachment  they
also attain <i>moksa</i> or liberation from <i>samsara</i>  or  the  cycle  of  birth  and
death. Now Lord Krishna speaks of those who are not devoted to Him  but  are
attracted to the various demigods such as Surya or  Kali  due  to  being  in
<i>raja  guna</i>  the  mode  of  passion  or  the  worship  of  vague   impersonal
conceptions of god without even a name, form  or  qualities  being  in  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of ignorance. All those rooted in  both  <i>raja  and  tama  guna</i>
have their minds bound and  chained  by  uncountable  mundane  desires  from
innumerable previous  lifetimes  and  they  remain  trapped  and  caught  in
<i>samsara or</i> the endless cycle  of  birth  and  death.   In  this  verse  Lord
Krishna is showing the superiority of His devotees  by  stating  <i>hrta  janah</i>
meaning those whose intelligence is  stolen  by  being  deviated  away  from
devotion to the Supreme Lord and  diverted  to  lesser  gods  with  inferior
conceptions for the fulfilment  of  material  desires  like  wealth,  power,
dominion. Such persons in <i>tama guna</i> worship demoniac  and  nefarious  beings
with  the  help  of  incantations  and  magic  formulas   for   hypnotising,
stupefying, subjugating and even killing an enemy or  troublesome  adversary
who is an obstacle to  accomplishing  their  desires.  Those  in  <i>raja  guna</i>
choose to offer hymns of adulation and service of adoration to the  demigods
for  quick  gratification  for  their  trivial  desires.  Both   engage   in
initiation, recitations of prayers and declarations from the texts  of  such
sects, vows  and  rituals.  All  these  activities  are  governed  by  one's
individual nature  in  the  form  of  tendencies  conscripted  from  desires
entertained in previous births from time immemorial.
