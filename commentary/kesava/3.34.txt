If everyone must act according to their nature and  no  living
being is void of their nature then the purpose of teaching the
Vedic scriptures by  the  spiritual  master  could  be  deemed
futile and unecessary. To  clarify  this  point  Lord  Krishna
repeats the word indriyasya twice to emphasise  that  for  all
the senses. Attraction to sweet tastes to the tongue which are
pleasurable or the aversion to foul smells of the  nose  which
are unpleasurable are all fixed and  automatically  happenning
in accordance with samskaras or past life  latent  impressions
in regard to all the senses. One  who  is  fortunate  to  hear
through the ears the holy words of the Vedic  scriptures  from
the spiritual master should never come under the influence  of
attaction and aversion because they are two great obstacles on
the path of moksa or liberation form material existence. These
two obstacles take an aspirant from the path leading to  moksa
and deviate them to the false path of desires, attachment  and
the enjoyment of  sense  objects  and  are  exactly  like  two
bandits who guide a traveller down a dark road  and  then  rob
them of all their wealth. Contrarily  when  when  a  policeman
sees a traveller in the clutches of a bandit  he  rescues  him
and guides him the correct way; similarly the spiritual master
teaching the Vedic scriptures rescues an aspirant  from  being
under  the  influence  of  the  dualities  of  attraction  and
aversion and guides them in the right path of  offering  oneâs
actions as yagna or worship to the Supreme Lord which  is  the
best and surest way to attain moksa.  So  teaching  the  Vedic
scriptures by the spiritual master  is  never  futile  to  the
contrary it is highly beneficial and essential.
