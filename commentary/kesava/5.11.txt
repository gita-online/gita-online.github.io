Attachment to the rewards to be gained from one's actions is the root  cause
for  bondage  to  the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death  in  material
existence. Lord Krishna presents this assertion with positive  and  negative
examples. The aspirant for <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  soul  who
unmotivated by desires offers all actions  unto  the  Supreme  Lord  attains
<i>moksa</i> or liberation and everlasting peace. Whereas the person  who  performs
actions never offering them to the supreme is contaminated with the  blemish
of selfish motives and the craving of rewards and is  unable  to  relinquish
the conception of ego and proprietorship thinking that  they  are  the  body
and miserably failing by  such  mentality  are  bound  tightly  in  material
existence.
