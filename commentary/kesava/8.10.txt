One  becoming  full  fledged  in  the  power  of  <i>yoga</i>  or  the   individual
consciousness attaining communion with the  ultimate  consciousness  in  the
form of concentration and meditation, possessing unending devotion,  who  at
the time of death directs the life force through the <i>sushana</i> channel in  the
spinal  cord  and  fixes  it  at  the  <i>ajna  chakra</i>  between  the  eyebrows,
meditating with steadfast mind on the Supreme Lord  Krishna  most  assuredly
attains Him.
