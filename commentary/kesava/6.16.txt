When will the persons qualified to practice  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with   then    ultimate
consciousness become established in <i>yoga</i> reaching perfection.  Lord  Krishna
declares that when the mind refrains and abstains  from all external  mental
activity and becomes exclusively riveted internally  on  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul
within. Then it has been determined by experts that the mind is  established
in <i>yoga.</i>
