Speaking of all other knowledge and the results such knowledge, Lord
Krishna concludes  chapter seven beginning with the words: sa-adhibhuta-
adhidaivam meaning that the essence of all embodied beings and the
demigods, must be known. Whoever by mercy of the authorised spiritual
master in disciplic succession knows Lord Krishna, be they originating from
those seeking fruitive desires or they originate from those with spiritual
wisdom. If they know Him as the integral essence of all existence within as
prakriti or the substratum pervading material existence, as the brahman or
the spiritual substratum pervading all existence and as the sole origin of
all creation. Along with knowing Him as paramatma or the Supreme Soul
within the etheric heart of each and every sentient being throughout
creation witnessing their every thought and action. Such elevated and
enlightened beings of purified heart and cleansed minds will be immersed in
relishing the remembrance of Lord Krishna up to and even during the moment
of death. In the next chapter after being questioned by Arjuna, the
intrinsic meanings of the terms brahman, adhibhuta, adhyatma and
adhidaivata will be elucidated further by Lord Krishna.

In the seventh chapter Lord Krishna illuminated His supremacy, He showed
the superiority of His devotees above all others and explained the root
cause of bondage to the cycle of birth and death as well as the root cause
of moksa or liberation from the cycle of birth and death. He magnanimously
revealed these things to the world out of compassion for His devotees.
