Lord Krishna speaks of the austerity of speech  as  the  recitation  of  the
Vedas, Puranas, Upanisads, Ramayan, Mahabharata and others  along  with  the
chanting of Vedic mantras. Also speaking words  that  are  totally  truthful
yet causes no offence to those  addressed  while  speaking  words  that  are
pleasant to be heard as well  as  beneficial  and  gives  satisfaction.  All
these are austerities of speech in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
