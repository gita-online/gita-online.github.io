Lord Krishna now reveals  why  one  who  serves  Him  in  the  previous  way
certainly attains communion with Him and  that  is  because  among  all  the
400,000 species of human beings in the material  creation  as  confirmed  in
Srimad Bhagavatam none is more exalted and dear to  Lord  Krishna  then  the
devotee who imparts the knowledge of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita  to  His  devotees
and none will ever be more exalted and dear to Him in the future.
