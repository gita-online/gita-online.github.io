Now regarding the situation on the battlefield, Lord Krishna  is  clarifying
to Arjuna that by this knowledge  he  will  no  longer  be  deluded  by  the
illusion of relatives, friends and preceptors dying and the  infatuation  of
thinking that if they did  he  would  not  even  want  to  continue  living;
because with spiritual knowledge he will realise his <i>atma</i> or soul  and  will
see the soul in all beings is identical with his soul and he  will  percieve
that all souls are the actual body of the Supreme Being and that  all  these
individual souls are pervaded by  the  Supreme  Being  and  they  are  never
independent from the Supreme Being in the state of bondage or the  state  of
liberation and  then  it  will  be  perceived  that  the  Supreme  Being  is
identical with Lord Krishna. The difference in various  beings  is  only  in
their outer physical form which is the product of primordial matter but  the
<i>atma</i> or soul is purely spiritual and eternal and of the nature of  spiritual
realisation, not subject to any modification and thus equally  situated  and
established in all beings who were naturally created from  material  nature.
The <i>atma</i> is not a different or separate entity from the Supreme Being.
