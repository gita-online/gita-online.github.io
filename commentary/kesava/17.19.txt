Here Lord Krishna speaks of the <i>danam</i> or charity characterised by <i>tama  guna</i>
the mode of ignorance. The <i>danam</i> which is given at an  improper  place  such
as a  city  where  cows  are  slaughtered  and  inhabited  by  degraded  and
unrighteous people like <i>mlecchas</i> or meat eaters. The <i>danam</i> that is given  at
an improper  time  such  as  the  48  minutes  of  twilight  or  during  the
astrological  influence  of  the  nakshatras  or  stars  <i>Ashlesha,  Jyeshtha</i>
and  <i>Mool.</i>  The  <i>danam</i>  that  is  given  to  unworthy  recipients  such   as
charlatans, fools, pretenders, entertainers, etc.  The  <i>danam</i>  given  in  an
insulting, complacent or pretentious  manner  even  if  given  to  a  worthy
recipient at a proper time and place is spoiled due to  a  lack  of  respect
and regard along with the absence of etiquette in honouring such a  one  and
lack of faith in the absolute authority of the Vedic scriptures and so  must
languish  in  the   mire  of  <i>tama  guna</i>  along  with   the   aforementioned
improprieties.
