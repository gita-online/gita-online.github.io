Lord  Krishna  expounds  upon  the  wonderful  position   of   His   devotee
emphasising it with the words <i>api cet suduracaro bhajate  mam</i>  meaning  even
if a person of extremely abominable habits  worships  Him  exclusively  they
are laudable. The devotees of Lord Krishna can never be  abominable  sinners
but if some how or other they took birth in a  low  caste  or  even  out  of
caste due to sinful reactions such as blaspheming the Vedic scriptures in  a
previous life; or even if born in a higher caste from righteous  family  one
deviates from righteous conduct as prescribed for their  caste  and  instead
lives a life of debauchery due to making  offences  against  devotees  in  a
previous life. Both are equally unfit to  be  considered  pious  yet  if  in
spite of this they worship  the  Supreme  Lord  exclusively  then  they  are
praiseworthy. One who is even more sinful then the two  aforesaid  mentioned
who has incurred great sins such as eating food before offering it unto  the
Supreme Lord, who eats grains on <i>Ekadasi</i> the 11th day  before  the  new  and
full moons, who is a liar and who is ungrateful is designated as the  vilest
of sinners. If such a person receiving the mercy of a devotee has  a  change
of heart and excluding the worship of any other god, devotes  themselves  to
worshipping the Supreme  Lord,  exclusively  surrendering  to  Him,  who  is
endowed with all possibilities, who is the supplier of  all  needs  and  the
protector of all, who is the sole objective and  goal  for  those  who  have
achieved <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence. Who is the  repository
for everyone, the goal and the source of all life; such a  being  should  be
considered venerable as the <i>jnani</i> stated earlier  in  VII.XVI  who  consider
the Supreme Lord as the sole goal because they also  are  absolute  devotees
of correct resolve.  The  absolute  devotee  worshipping  the  Supreme  Lord
exclusively does not desire any rewards for  such  service  except  to  have
communion with Him is the best of the best. The absolute  devotee  has  come
to the irrevocable resolve that surrender to the Supreme Lord  Krishna,  the
origin of all creation, the source of all sentient beings, the objective  of
the Upanisads, the beloved of the gopi's  and  the  hope  of  the  liberated
beings. This surrender applies to any of  His  authorised  incarnations  and
expansions as well asn is the only object of attainment and that worship  of
Him can only be performed through the authority  of  the  Vedic  scriptures
under the guidance of a spiritual preceptor from one of  the  four  bonafide
<i>sampradaya's</i> empowered spiritual line of disciplic succession. The  particle
<i>api cet</i> meaning even if denotes  all  possibilities  according  to  Panini's
rule I.IV.LXXXXVI.
<p>
The understanding is that even if  due  to  excessive  sinful  activities  a
person was unfit  for  inclusion  of  conduct  worthy  of  Vedic  piety  and
suffered a demotion and downfall; the Supreme Lord  being  a  ocean  of  all
auspicious attributes like compassion, forgiveness, kindness  and  affection
graced such a person with a human birth and association with  the  spiritual
preceptor to guide such a person back to absolute devotion for  the  Supreme
Lord. Compassion is the Supreme Lord's nature and thus naturally  we  depend
fully upon His  compassionate  nature.  Such  a  person  realises  that  the
Supreme Lord Himself caused them  to perceive the <i>atma</i> or  soul  as  totally
under His control and to be separate from  the  physical  body  and  senses.
Thus made aware that one is  His  absolute  devotee  by  the  grace  of  the
spiritual  preceptor  one  becomes  very  grateful  and  humble.   Therefore
immensely appreciating His mercy  it  is  their  prime  duty  to  serve  the
spiritual preceptor wholeheartedly and worship the Supreme Lord  who  is  an
ocean of boundless mercy life after life.  This  is  the  unparalleled  firm
resolve of the absolute devotee.
