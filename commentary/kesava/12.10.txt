If those seeking <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence would  wish  to
develop <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to  Lord  Krishna  which  is
characterised  by  completely  focusing  the  mind  and  the  intellect   in
meditation upon Him alone which is the essential prerequisite for  attaining
the Supreme Lord. Yet if there is ineligibility in this regard Lord  Krishna
has  compassionately  given  in  descending  order  alternate  methods  each
succeeding one easier than the preceding one such as continuous practice  of
thinking exclusively of Him, perform regularly actions of  devotion  and  at
least relinquish the desire for the rewards of one's  actions.  Now  we  see
that He extols and  praises  renunciation  of  rewards  because  it  bestows
purity of mind and combined with <i>bhakti</i> leads one directly  to  the  Supreme
Lord. Superior is knowledge of Vedic scriptures acquired from the  teachings
at the feet of the spiritual master. <i>Atma  tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation  is
superior to meditation and the Svetasvatara  Upanisad  I.III  states:  After
passing  through  abstraction  and  meditation  those  who   achieved   <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> perceived the innate power of the Supreme Lord concealed  within  His
own qualities. <i>Atma tattva</i> is not achieved by meditation upon the  abstract;
but by meditation upon the Supreme Lord combined with renunciation  for  the
rewards of actions <i>atma tattva</i> is certainly achieved and the best  means  to
enhance one's spiritual development.  This  is  because  by  renouncing  the
desire for reward for one's activities one no longer  is  forced  to  accept
the reactions for one's actions and sins are no  longer  accrued.  Thus  one
achieves the Supreme peace. Lord Krishna has already  explained  in  chapter
two, verse 55 that the renunciation of all desires and cravings of the  mind
bestows the highest bliss and that one who has achieved this  is  considered
to be <i>sthita-prajna</i> or self realised because one's satisfaction  comes  from
the bliss of the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul  within.  The  Katha  Upanisad  VI.XIV
states: When all the desires lodged in one's heart have been  given  up  and
released then a mortal being becomes immortal and realises  the  <i>brahman</i>  or
the spiritual substratum pervading all existence.
