Lord Krishna is explaining that knowledge of this <i>asvattha</i>  or  banyan  tree
which symbolises material nature is very rarely understood and not by  many.
What its roots and  branches  represent,  described  as  all  the  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings is not perceived but by a few in this world. It has  neither
a beginning nor an end as its stream of <i>samsara</i> or the  perpetual  cycle  of
birth amd death is continuous. It is very difficult to fathom from  a  human
perspectuive on Earth. Does it begin for each <i>jiva</i> at  birth?  Does  it  end
when a <i>jiva</i> disentangles themselves from material nature by  detachment?  Is
it relative to the individual or is it collective? From what position is  it
operating: beginning, middle or end? So from all these suppositions  it  can
be understood that this tree  is  beyond  perception  of  the  five  mundane
senses and the mind. To terminate this firmly rooted  and  durable  <i>asvattha</i>
tree in the form of material existence with its  ardent  desires  for  name,
fame, wealth and family which link to the evils of birth, old  age,  disease
and death for everyone; is a very serious and extremely  difficult  task  to
accomplish. Yet it can be overcome by <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving  devotion
unto the Supreme Lord Krishna which insures detachment from the  objects  of
the senses and sensual pleasures. One desirous of their own  best  interests
and highest good will by the  sharp  intellect  of  discrimination  and  the
formidable weapon of dispassion abandon all desires for sense  gratification
which are  products  of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature.
Succeeding by knowledge and effort one should  then  diligently  strive  for
the Supreme state of consciousness for  once  attaining  one  is  no  longer
subject to <i>samsara</i> and never again returns to the material worlds.

The question in mind is how can  this  be  accomplished?  Lord  Krishna  has
already confirmed previously in chaper VII.XIV: That although  His  <i>maya</i>  or
illusory  potency  in  the  material  existence  is  almost  impossible   to
overcome, those who <i>prapadye</i> or surrender unto Him  are  able  to  transcend
it. This means by completely making Him their sole refuge they activate  the
inherent divine potency abiding within the <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  of  all
<i>jivas.</i> This divine potency is eternally on standby waiting for the  <i>jiva</i>  to
turn away from the external mundane world and look internally for  the  <i>atma</i>
within one's heart. The Supreme Lord Krishna has  made  all  provisions  for
this activation to immeadiately come into effect the very moment  one  fully
surrenders unto Him or any of His authorised  incarnations  and  expansions.
How wonderful! How merciful is the Supreme Lord Krishna. Without His  mercy,
without His grace through His bonafide representative, the spiritual  master
in authorised disiplic succession as revealed in the  Vedic  scriptures,  it
is totally impossible to be released  from  <i>samsara</i>  and  achieve  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence. Those blessed spiritual beings who  take
complete shelter in the Supreme Lord transcend this  world  and  go  to  the
eternal spiritual worlds never to return again. As for all the  others  they
are recycled byck into the material existence  incessantly  and  subject  to
the Supreme Lords eight-fold potencies of earth, water,  fire,  air,  ether,
mind, intellect and false ego  which  comprises  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  physical
substratum pervading physical existence as  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself  has
stated in VII.IV.
