As Arjuna has surmised in the previous verse it is not in his best  interest
to fight according to his understanding. Now it is seen that he repents  the
fact of even considering that it would be  fruitful  to  fight  a  war  that
would bring such evil consequences. Thinking that his intelligence  must  be
marred by delusion he sorrowfully  speaks  the  words:  <i>aho  bata</i>  alas  how
ironic it is. What is ironic? It is ironic to  him  that  he  has  committed
himself to great sin by his intention to slay friends  and  kinsman  in  the
pursuit of royal pleasures and enjoyments.
