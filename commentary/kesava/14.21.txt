Having heard Lord Krishna declare that those who transcend the  three  <i>gunas</i>
or modes of material nature attain  immortality  amazes  Arjuna  and  he  is
exhilarated to know about the characteristics  and  conduct  of  such  great
beings  as  well  as  by  what  means  they  were  able  to  achieve   this.
Specifically he asks Lord Krishna to reveal by what symptoms can such a  one
be recognised? What is their behavior and by what method they were  able  to
attain this.
