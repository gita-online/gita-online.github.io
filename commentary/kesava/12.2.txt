Lord  Krishna  confirms  that  those  who  with  firm  faith   focus   their
consciousness exclusively upon Him without cessation are <i>yuktatamah</i>  or  the
most superior of all as  they  worship  Him,  who  is  an  ocean  of  divine
attributes and qualities such as  omniscience,  omnipotence,  compassionate,
noble,  etc.  continuously  within  their  minds  which   by   contemplating
eradicates any blemishes and imperfections such devotee may still possess.
