Arjuna had previously requested Lord Krishna to see His <i>visvarupa</i> or  divine
universal form. When Lord Krishna exhibited the  terrifying  aspect  of  the
<i>visvarupa</i> Arjuna became unbalanced  and  agitated  and  becoming  bewildered
stated <i>namo'stu te deva-vara</i> meaning I offer obeisance  to  you,  and  asked
the question to Lord Krishna: Who are you of such terrible form? Arjuna  saw
the terrible external  form  of  the  <i>visvarupa</i>  but  could  not  know  Lord
Krishna's intention for exhibiting it. Now he wishes to know  who  and  what
Lord Krishna is beyond the external manifestation of the <i>visvarupa.</i>
