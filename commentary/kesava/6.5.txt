It should be clearly comprehend that attachment to worldly  pleasures  locks
one to <i>samsara</i> or the endless cycle of  birth  and  death  while  contrarily
detachment  from  the  infatuation  of  worldly  pleasures  frees  one  from
<i>samsara.</i> So everyone should try to elevate themselves with determination  by
training their mind  with  constant  practice  to  be  unattached  to  sense
objects.  Lord  Krishna  is  revealing  the  method  of  escaping  perpetual
incarceration in the material existence. The mind has the propensity  to  be
one's dearest friend so  why  not  utilise  it  to  uplift  oneself  out  of
material  darkness  and  into  spiritual  light.  A  controlled   mind   can
accomplish so many beneficial endeavours for one's  wellbeing.   Whereas  an
uncontrolled mind  is  one's  worst  enemy  performing  base  and  degrading
activities leading to destruction.
