What happens after one has fully enjoyed heavenly  delights  exhausting  all
their merit? They must take birth again in the worlds of mortals  and  begin
accumulating sufficient merit all over again by performing the same  rituals
prescribed in  the  Vedas  for  entering  the  celestial  spheres  to  enjoy
heavenly delights all due to motivation of desires.  Again  and  again  they
must be imprisoned inside a mothers womb for  nine  months,  lifetime  after
lifetime  revolving in this cycle unceasingly because they  hanker  so  much
for heavenly pleasures. But when their merit is used up again  they  are  in
transition down to the cycle of birth and death  and  then  back  to  heaven
incessantly repeating the same process over and over.
