Lord Krishna explains that actions that involve excessive effort  and  cause
stress and strain from the conception to the completion.  Actions  that  are
executed with the expectation of enjoyment and  rewards.  Actions  that  are
motivated by vanity, conceit and egoism as well as desire  for  recognition.
Such actions are known to be situated in <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion.
