When the Supreme Lord initiates such actions as creation  which  appears  at
times to be unequal and unbalanced how is it that He is not bound  by  these
actions like the <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings. It is because  He  is  <i>udasinavad</i>
<i>asinam</i> or neutral and indifferent, because He is completely  self-satisfied.
What Lord Krishna is also indicating is that one  who  is  self  content  is
unattached to the results of actions while one with  attachment  to  actions
is bound by such attachment and must accept  the  subsequent  reactions.  If
Lord  Krishna  was  not  neutrally  disposed  to  all  acts   of   creation,
sustenance, preservation, dissolution, etc. then  His  doership  could  have
some bias and not be equally justifiable  for  all.  The  adjective  <i>asaktam</i>
meaning unattached denotes that the Supreme Lord is complete  and  fulfilled
in all respects.
