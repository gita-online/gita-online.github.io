In order to firmly establish that all Vedic activities should  be  performed
with full  faith  denoting  with  spiritual  knowledge  acquired  by  humbly
enquiring from the bonafide Vaisnava spiritual preceptor in one of the  four
authorised <i>sampradayas</i> or  channels  of  disciplic  succession  revealed  in
Vedic scriptures. The Supreme Lord Krishna  emphasises  the  utter  futility
and worthlessness of prescribed Vedic activities executed  without  inherent
<i>sraddha</i> or resolute faith. Whatever is offered regardless of how  perfectly,
whatever is  performed  regardless  of  how  austere,  whatever  is  donated
regardless how opulent; if devoid of inherent,  resolute  faith  it  has  no
value whatsoever in this world or the next,  in  the  present  life  and  in
future lives  and  is  known  as  <i>a-sat</i>  the  antithesis  to  SAT  perpetual
goodness. Without faith the supporting cause is absent and does  not  create
an effect in time affecting future reincarnations.
<p>
The Vedic scriptures explicitly state that  the  actions  of  the  righteous
become pure  by  faith.  Therefore  meticulously  eschewing  all  activities
characterised by <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion which due  to  self-motivated
desires keeps one locked in <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth  and  death
and fastidiously avoiding all activities  characterised  by  <i>tama  guna</i>  the
mode of ignorance which due to nescience degrades one into existence in  the
inferior hellish planets are the instructions one  must  steadfastly  adhere
to.
<p>
An aspirant should remain permanently situated in <i>sattva guna</i>  the  mode  of
goodness and with full faith in the Supreme Lord, the Vedic  scriptures  and
the Vaisnava spiritual master, performing  prescribed  Vedic  activities  to
the best of one's ability  to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations and expansions as revealed in Vedic scriptures.  The
performance of all activities for sake of the Supreme Lord is designated  as
righteousness and bequeaths inner purity,  spiritual  wisdom  and  devotion;
guiding a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being  to  <i>atma  tatvva</i>  or  realisation  of  the
immortal soul,  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material  existence  and  final
beatitude and communion with the Supreme Lord Krishna.
