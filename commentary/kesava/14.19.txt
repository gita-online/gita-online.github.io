Thus the definitions, characteristics, and types of bondage  caused  by  the
influence of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature;  which  locks  the
<i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  within  the   material   existence   has   been
definitively deleneated by Lord Krishna.  All  this  was  referring  to  His
statement in chapter 13, verse 22 beginning <i>purusa prakriti</i>  that the  <i>jivas</i>
infatuation with material nature is the sole cause  of  their  imprisonment.
But now He speaks of communion with Him, the ultimate attainment of all.  In
verse two of this chapter Healready revealed that those who take  refuge  in
this knowledge He is giving achieve  communion  with  Him.  First  one  must
engage themselves in eating only vegetarian foods which are in  <i>sattva  guna</i>
or the mode of goodness and are beneficial for spiritual developement.  Then
one must rise above the qualities of <i>raja guna</i> or mode of passion  which  is
full of desires and attachments and overcome the influence of <i>tama  guna</i>  or
mode of ignorance which causes inertia,  perverst  and  distorting  reality.
Then one will perceive that the three <i>gunas</i> are the doer and the  motivating
factors that impel the <i>jivass</i> to perform actions predicated  upon  <i>samskaras</i>
or impulses from previous births. The  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  is  totally
transcendental to <i>prakriti</i> or the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence and also of course to its by products  the  three  <i>gunas.</i>  In  the
state of bondage all actions are determined by the three <i>gunas</i> but  they  do
not contaminate the <i>jivas</i> inherent eternal nature which is  beyond  them  as
their influence endures only as long as the activity lasts. When due to  the
predominance of <i>sattva guna</i> the heart finally becomes pure and tranquil  the
<i>jiva</i> by knowledge of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  immortal  soul
becomes  detached  from  even  the  qualities  of  <i>sattva  guna</i>  which   are
unnecessary and such a one becomes established in the  <i>atma</i>  and  free  from
the misery of <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death.
