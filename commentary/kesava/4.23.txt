It is being stated by Lord Krishna  why  a  <i>yogi</i>  or  one  whose  individual
consciousness is in communion with the ultimate consciousness is  not  bound
by actions although engaged in actions.  Because  such  a  one  is  free  of
passion and likes and dislikes. Devoid  of  attachment  to  the  rewards  of
actions due to one's mind being firmly fixed in the bliss  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or
soul and  who  performs  all  actions  completely  according  to  the  Vedic
injunctions as a <i>yagna</i> or an offering of worship  for  the  propitiation  to
the Supreme Lord. This is why such a person is never bound. When such a  one
is not interested in achieving merit or distinction how can  they  ever  get
demerits by being tempted to perform any prohibited act. Although  the  doer
is known to hold equal shares of merit or demerit with the one  who  caused,
the inspirer and the on who proposed in positive or negative  results.  Such
a <i>yogi</i> is  never  implicated  because  others  perform  actions  solely  for
desires of rewards while the <i>yogi</i> does not.
