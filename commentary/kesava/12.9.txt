If one finds themselves unable to even perfom activities  of  propitaion  to
Lord Krishna in a regular manner then there is an easier method to  approach
Him for His devotees and  that  is  with  a  controlled  mind  renounce  the
results of one actions and not desire for rewards for what  one  does.  This
infers not hankering for the results of  performing  obligatory  rites  like
fasting from all grains on <i>Ekadasi</i> which is the 11th day of the  waxing  and
waning or the performance of occasional rites such as  celebrating  festival
days of the Supreme Lord with pomp and splendour. The purport is to  perform
all one's activities without desiring any rewards for the actions. By  doing
this the mind becomes pure  because  it  is  not  contaminated  by  fruitive
desires. This will bestow spiritual knowledge and then <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive
loving devotion and Lord Krishna's  direct  realisation  in  due  course  of
time.
