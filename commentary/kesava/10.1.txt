Thus Lord Krishna declared in the  seventh  and  eighth  chapters  that  the
Supreme Lord is only accessible by <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion.  Then  in  the
ninth chapter the greatness of this loving devotion to the Supreme Lord  was
revealed directly by the realisation  of  consciousness  and  indirectly  by
declaring the  eternal,  spiritual  benefits  gained  for  His  devotees  as
opposed to the temporary, material benefits gained by the  votaries  of  the
demigods and all other gods. Now in order to induce the realisation  of  His
infinite  Supremacy  over  all  to  germinate  and  transform  into   loving
devotion, He speaks this verse for Arjuna's and devotees like him for  their
highest interests  and  best  welfare.  This  is  because  although  it  was
discoursed upon earlier the greatness and majesty of the Supreme Lord is  so
extraordinary and phenomenal that  it  is  very  difficult  to  be  properly
understood  by  most.  So  Lord  Krishna  shines  light  upon   this   theme
reiterating it commencing with the  words  <i>bhuyah  eva</i>  meaning  once  again
which emphasises that one should listen attentively  to  glean  the  essence
and comprehend. The ultimate revelation which  will  enlighten  the  Supreme
Reality in its entirety regarding the magnificence and glory of the  Supreme
Lord causing <i>bhakti</i> for Him to germinate  and  grow  expeditiously  for  the
highest good for Arjuna and the devotees.
