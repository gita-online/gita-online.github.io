The discussion of the previous verse is  augmented  here  by  the  statement
<i>yogam tam viddhi</i> meaning know that <i>yoga</i> or the  science  of  the  individual
consciousness attaining communion with  the  ultimate  consciousness,  which
means performing  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  prescribed  Vedic  activities  selflessly
without  any  sense  of  ego  for  rewards  is  the  same  as  <i>sannyasa</i>   or
renunciation in abnegation. In the Vedic scriptures are seen passages  like:
Thus go beyond even <i>sannyasa</i> by performing all actions in this manner.  This
is designated as true renunciation. Why? Because one may not  be  considered
doing <i>yoga</i> without the cessation of desires for reward.
