Although Lord Krishna's instructions are perfectly correct  still  it  might
be submitted that one coming from noble lineage should only fight  a  battle
which is not antagonistic to ones family traditions regarding  righteousness
and not fight a battle which  would  be  instrumental  in  destroying  these
family traditions. Arjuna is asking how can he engage  in  battle  with  his
superior Bhishma and his preceptor Drona. When even to  argue  against  them
is improper then what to think against attacking them with deadly arrows  in
earnest.  Why? Because preceptors and superiors are always to be  respected.
Duryodhana by placing Bhishma and Drona directly  in  the  forefront  caused
the ever righteous Pandavas discomfort at the thought  of  having  to  fight
against them as it was opposed to  the  time  honored  noble  traditions  of
their family lineage. So what Arjuna in fact is stating is why  should  they
engage themselves in  this  battle  being  aware  of  the  great  sinfulness
declared in the Vedic  scriptures  of  disregarding  superiors  and  showing
aggression against the preceptor which results in the  perpetrator  becoming
a ghostly demon known as a brahma-raksasa.
