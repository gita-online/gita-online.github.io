Out of compassion Lord Krishna states the  truth  of  action,  inaction  and
prohibited  actions.  One  who  sees  inaction  in  action  meaning  actions
bringing no reaction and are not binding to <i>samsara</i> or the  cycle  of  birth
and death such as <i>yagna</i> or the worship of the Supreme Lord  which  leads  to
knowledge, purity of mind and liberation know it is not binding to  <i>samsara.</i>
Previously in verse II.XXXX Lord Krishna stated  that  in  prescribed  Vedic
actions there is no loss or fear  of  negative  results.  Contrarily  sinful
reactions and bondage will be incurred by inaction to the injunction one  is
qualified to perform  such  as  non-performance  of  <i>Ekadasi  vrata</i>  or  the
complete abstention from all grains on  the  11th  day  of  the  waxing  and
waning moons. Lord Krishna spoke of this mentality  of  hypocrisy  in  verse
III.VI of one who contemplates sense objects while appearing  inactive.  The
use of the particle <i>ca</i> meaning and, denotes that those who are followers  of
<i>karma yoga</i> or  the  performance  of  prescribed  Vedic  activities  wilfully
partakes of prohibited food such as grains on  <i>Ekadasi</i>  then  they  will  be
subject to sinful reactions. But if suc a one planning  to  observe  <i>Ekadasi</i>
<i>vrata</i>  and    accidentally  partakes  of  food  grains  on  <i>Ekadasi</i>  due  to
miscalculating the time of commencing or breaking the fast then there is  no
sinful reactions because the <i>sankalpa</i> or internal invocation was to  perform
the <i>Ekadasi vrata.</i> Then Lord Krishna praises the one  who  knows  the  truth
about  the  intricacies  of  action  and  inaction  as  those  of   superior
intelligence and is firmly  on  the  spiritual  path  obtaining  all  fruits
because the performer of Vedic actions receives the fruits  of  the  actions
included by inaction as well.
