By the distinctive singular use of the soul being embodied in this verse  it
is clear that Arjuna is not under illusion that all souls are one.  So  Lord
Krishna speaks of the  soul  within  the  body  of  a  every  living  entity
indicating different bodies for different species all being  receptacles  of
enjoyment in variegated ways. But due to the  reality  that  all  souls  are
immortal it does not behove Arjuna to lament as the soul is always  entering
into various external forms until liberation has been achieved.
