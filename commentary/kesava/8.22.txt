In this way what was designated as <i>aksara</i> or indestructible is  the  supreme
goal of the <i>jiva</i> or embodied soul as spoken previously;  but  to  avoid  the
identity of it as being the Supreme Being, Lord Krishna clarifies  that  the
Supreme Lord is <i>Purusa</i> with form and personality  and  in  reality  distinct
from  the  <i>jiva</i>  although  He  resides  within  each  and  every  one.  This
distinctness is already adequately established in the Brahma Sutras  I.I.XXI
which states: On account of a distinction being made  the  Supreme  Lord  is
different from the individual <i>atma</i> or soul. The Svetasvatara Upanisad  VI.IX
states: He is higher than the highest and  imperishable.  To  Him  alone  is
rulership of the rulers and the God of all gods. There is  nothing  superior
to or equal to Him. The Katha Upanisad  II.II.XIII  states:  He  is  eternal
among eternals and supra-conscious among the conscious. The  Katha  Upanisad
I.II.XXIII states: He is only attainable to one whom He, Himself selects.  <i>.</i>
Th Puranas state: He  is  the  Lord  of  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence and all embodied souls. He  is  the  controlles
of the three <i>gunas</i> of goodness, passion and ignorance. He is the highest  of
the highest and imperishable. In Brahma Sutras II.I.XXII it states:  But  on
account of such distinction the <i>brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence is something more than the  <i>atma;</i>  but  the  Supreme  Lord  is
beyond even the <i>brahman.</i> He is the ultimate reality and His form of <i>sat-cid-</i>
<i>ananda</i> or knowledge, eternity and bliss is the form of the ultimate goal  of
all existence. This verse reiterated again what was emphasised in  verse  15
of this chapter for the benefit of all embodied souls.
