The purport is that the conchshell Pancajanya of Lord Krishna and the  conch
shells Devadatta, Paundram, Anantavijaya, Sughosa  and  Manipuspaka  of  the
five Panadvas are renowned and famous; but in the army of  Duryodhana  there
are no famous conch shells with any names. The point is whoever has  aligned
themselves with the Supreme Lord Krishna  as  their  protector,  undoubtedly
without question will  always  be  victorious.  Then  the  warriors  of  the
Pandava army began to sound their conch  shells.  Sikhandi  is  the  son  of
Drupada  who  was  born  out  of  penance  especially   to   slay   Bhishma.
Dristradyumna was born from a  fire  sacrifice  especially  to  slay  Drona.
Satyaki was invincible like Arjuna never knowing defeat. So  this  verse  is
indirectly revealing to Dhritarastra that he should not entertain any  ideas
that his son Duryodhana will be victorious  in  the  battle  even  with  the
assistance of Bhishma and Drona.
