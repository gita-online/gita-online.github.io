After humbly beseeching forgiveness for any past indiscretions he may have
incurred and observing that Lord Krishna was not displeased, Arjuna
confesses that although the visvarupa or divine universal form was
wonderful to behold the terrifying aspect of it caused him to be fearful
and agitated. So he requests Lord Krishna to revert back to the  form by
which he is familiar with to placate his mind and raise his spirits.
