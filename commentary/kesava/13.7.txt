After describing the  20  indispensable  attributes  that  are  required  to
achieve the Supreme Ultimate Truth now Lord Krishna explains at  length  the
nature of the <i>ksetra-jna</i> or knower of the field of activity  with  reference
to the individual <i>atma</i> or immortal soul which is well worth knowing  and  of
great  value.  Understanding  that  the  <i>atma</i>  is  eternal  and   completely
different from the perishable physical body and is not  subject  to  mundane
modifications like birth, old age, disease and death  one  begins  to  taste
supreme bliss. The <i>atma</i>  is  beyond  all  the  qualities  and  potencies  of
material existence no matter how powerful they may be. The  Prasna  Upanisad
V.V beginning  <i>yah  punaretam  trima  trenomiti</i>  meaning:  One  beholds  the
Supreme Being residing within the etheric  heart  and  is  higher  than  the
highest living reality. Then access to the realm  of  the  Supreme  Lord  is
achieved  which  is  permeated  by  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual   substratum
pervading all existence and is the prime cause  of  primordial  matter,  the
<i>jiva</i> or embodied being and eternal time. The true nature of the <i>brahman</i>  the
innermost self as the <i>atma</i> is  revealed  and  all  nescience  is  completely
removed. This is known to be neither <i>sat</i> or existence and  neither  <i>asat</i>  or
non-existence.
<p>
The use of the term innermost self to refer to the <i>brahman</i> does  not  create
any contradiction because when the <i>atma</i> is realised its veil is removed  and
nescience is removed with it and the extensive and unlimited  nature  it  is
endowed with is revealed. The  Mundaka  Upanisad  III.I.III  beginning  <i>yada</i>
<i>pashyah pashyate</i> meaning: When moksa or  liberation  is  achieved  one  cuts
asunder the knots of worldly bondage and attains proximity  to  the  Supreme
Lord. Also one who has achieved <i>moksa</i> is known to be omnicient as  is  shown
in the Chandogya Upanisad VII.XXVI.II beginning <i>na pashyo  myritam  pashyati</i>
<i>na</i> means: The enlightened one realising the Supreme Lord  has  realised  the
<i>atma</i> and all else.
The Supreme Reality is called <i>sat</i> eternal existence in its  state  of  being
because of its capacity to divide itself into names and forms.  The  Supreme
Reality is also called <i>asat</i> or non-existence because of  its  incapacity  to
divide itself into names and forms. This is also  given  in  the  Taittiriya
Upanisad II.VII beginning  <i>asadva  idamagre  asit</i>  meaning:  Verily  in  the
beginning  this  creation  was  non-existent.  Also  in  the  Brihadaranyaka
Upanisad I.IV.VII beginning <i>taddedam tarhayavaya</i> meaning: Verily before  the
demigod Brahma became the secondary, instrumental cause  of   creation,  the
whole creation was dormant in its unmanifested form under the  sway  of  the
primary efficient cause. So because the  Supreme  Reality  of  the  <i>atma</i>  is
beyond both <i>sat</i> and <i>asat</i> it is known  as  being  and  non-being.  The  Katha
Upanisad I.II.XVIII beginning <i>na  jayate  mriyate  va</i>  means:  The  soul  is
unborn, eternal unchangeable and never subject to death.
