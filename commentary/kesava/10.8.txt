Here Lord Krishna elaborates on the great souls method of worship  with  the
words <i>mac-citta</i> or their minds dedicated to Him and <i>mad-gata-prana</i> or  their
life airs surrendered fully  to Him inferring also  the  presiding  demigods
and their function over their respective sense organs such as ear  and  eye,
etc. This denotes using the eyes to see the Supreme Lord, using the  ear  to
hear His praises, using the tongue  to  chant  His  glories,  etc.  all  for
propitiating  Him  as  the  goal.  Enlightening  one  another  about   their
realisations about Him, exchanging ecstasies with  each  other  about  their
realisations  and  experiences  with  Him.   Also   discoursing   with   the
appropriates logical and introspective reasoning  propounded  in  the  Vedic
scriptures and the  commentaries  of  the  previous  acarya's  in  disciplic
succession about Lord  Krishna's  supreme  absolute  position  as  the  sole
cause, maintainer and sustainer of all  creation.  Of  one  mind  and  heart
discussing His transcendental qualities and attributes  they  grow  in  true
friendship and admiration for each other relating  whatever  knowledge  they
have of Him, great or small it is all mutually relished whether  they  speak
of His virtues, His mercy, His <i>avatars</i> or  incarnations  or  His  phenomenal
extraordinary <i>lila's</i> or divine pastimes or just by hearing about them.  From
both a wonderful  feeling  of  indescribable  contentment  arises  and  they
become completely satisfied within.
