That person of  Vedic spiritual wisdom  who  knows  the  exact
distinction between prakriti or material nature and the  gunsa
or the modes of goodness, passion and  nescience;  along  with
there agents the five senses  of  seeing,  hearing,  smelling,
tasting   and  touching  does  not  get   attached   to   them
understanding that one ever one thinks, speaks or does is  but
a modification of  prakriti  projected through the  gunas  and
such a person is not beguiled into thinking that they are  the
doer of their actions. This is the  meaning  Lord  Krishna  is
conveying.
