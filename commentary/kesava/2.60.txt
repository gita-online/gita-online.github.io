Because the uncontrolled senses are the cause of all disturbance,  one  with
spiritual  intelligence  seeking  transcendence  should  make  their   first
priority to control ones senses.  Then having  duly  controlled  the  senses
which are troublesome one should be seated or situated in the meditation  of
maintaining this control. Here the word asita or seated does  not  refer  to
literally being seated but rather to being  established  or  situated.  This
verse concludes on how such a one is seated. If one were to question how  is
it possible to control the restless senses which are  turbulent  by  nature.
Lord Krishna reveals that by devotion of mind and  heart  unto  the  Supreme
Lord one will surely be able to control the senses. Lord Krishna is  present
within the heart of all living  entities.  As  Hrisikesa  the  lord  of  the
senses he is the ultimate object of all meditation.  Without  meditating  on
Lord Krishna it is not possible to master the  senses.  This  is  absolutely
sure and thus the aspirant who follows these instructions  has  success  and
none other. So in  conclusion  one  cannot  be  in  transcendent  meditation
without controlling the senses. And  that  controlling  the  senses  is  not
possible without devotion to Lord Krishna. Thus  devotion  to  Lord  Krishna
can be seen as the essential ingredient assuring all success.
