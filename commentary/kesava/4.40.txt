After explaining concisely  how  the  person  of  faith  acquires  spiritual
knowledge through the instructions of the  spiritual  master,  Lord  Krishna
speaks of the miserable fate of the ignorant who are devoid of faith but  in
this verse He uses the particle <i>ca</i> twice meaning again and  again  is  given
to indicate that by the mercy of the spiritual master even the  ignorant  if
they have faith can be eventually liberated by performing some  easy  simple
practice as determined by the spiritual master. But a person with  no  faith
will not engage themselves in any practice  because  they  do  not  believe.
Still one with no faith may  still  have  a  chance  to  be  liberated  even
without practising if they have some association with self  realised  beings
or if they take the opportunity to render service to them. The  doubting  is
of a more severe nature as doubting of the  instructions  of  the  spiritual
master, doubting  the  authority  of  the  Vedic  scriptures,  doubting  the
superiority of Vaisnavism, doubting the reality  of  the  deities  presence.
All these things put one's mind in a hellish condition and with an  unstable
mind one does not follow any path fully but  runs  hither  and  thither  and
thus deviates from the natural path of human beings which is only  found  in
the Vedic scriptures. For the doubter of little faith there is no  happiness
in this world or the next having performed no spiritual activities  in  this
life such as even marriage which  is  a  sacred  rite  and  thus  having  no
offspring from marriage which  is  also  a  sacred  rite  and  thus  by  not
accruing any spiritual merit in this life one's chance for happiness in  the
next life are bleak and grim as well. The meaning is how is it possible  for
such persons ever to become liberated if they doubt the  very  essence  that
they received their existence from.
