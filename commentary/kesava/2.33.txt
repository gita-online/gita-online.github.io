Now Lord Krishna responds to Arjunas previous distress  of  not  wanting  to
slay his enemies such as Bhishma and Drona but instead to allow his  enemies
to slay him. The use of the word atha is to emphasise another point of  view
that if  Arjuna  declines  to  fight  this  righteous  war  and  chooses  to
disregard the acquisition of happiness in either this world or the  heavenly
worlds as enjoined in the  Vedic  scriptures  which  state  that  the  royal
orders should conquer over his enemies and rule  over  the  earth.  Then  by
refusing to accept his responsibility and avoiding the battle  Arjuna  would
be abandoning his duty which brings rewards and  boundless  glory  and  thus
losing his reputation  both  worldly  and  divine  which  results  from  the
victory of a great warrior Arjuna would in fact incur great sin.
