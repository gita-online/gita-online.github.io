Now Lord Krishna speaks of the ascending stationary and  descending  spirals
that He already began in verses 14 and 15. Those situated in <i>sattva guna</i>  or
the mode of goodness ascend to the heavenly spheres including the wordls  of
the ancestors, the worlds of the demigods etc. up onto Satyaloka the  planet
of Brahma. There by  performing  pious  activities  in  the  association  of
liberated beings they  gradually  perfect  themselves  and  are  freed  from
material existence and not subjected to accept <i>samsara</i> the  perpetual  cycle
of birth and death. Those situated in <i>raja  guna</i>  or  mode  of  passion  who
seeking rewards desire the pleasures  of  the  heavens  perform  rituals  to
obtain such. After enjoying the temporary rewards for  their  endeavors  and
their <i>punya</i> or merits have been exhausted, they again are forced  to  suffer
<i>samsara</i> over and over again due to  greed  for  desires  and  attachment  to
pleasures of the flesh. Those situated in <i>tama guna</i> or  mode  of  ignorance,
whose consciousness is full  of  inertia  and  nescience  and  enveloped  in
darkness.They are full of degraded desires and degenerative  impulses  whose
reactions caues them to sink deep into one of the 28  fiery  hellish  worlds
such  as  <i>Tamisra</i>  reserved  for  stealers  of  others  wives  and  property
and <i>Raurava</i> reserved  for  the  killers,  sellers,  cookers  and  eaters  of
animals. Anyone who is a killer  or  eater  of  cows  will  definitely  have
<i>Rauvara</i>  as  their  hellish  destination  where  having  received   abundant
punishment and suffering appropriate to their self induced  previous  sinful
activities, they will take birth in the animal species as a dog, or pig,  or
even in lower species as an insect or worm.
