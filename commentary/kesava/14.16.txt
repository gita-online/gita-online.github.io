Now Lord Krishna speaks of  the  different  results  one  receives  and  the
consequences of being in one or  the  other  of  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of
material nature. The <i>avatar</i> or divine incarnation Kapila deva has  confirmed
that the result characterised by <i>sattva guna</i> or  the  mode  of  goodness  is
purity, happiness and wisdom. The  result  of  <i>raja  guna</i>  or  the  mode  of
passion is characterised by pleasure and pain  due  to  the  combination  of
merit and sin in the activities committed. The result of <i>tama  guna</i>  or  the
mode of ignorance is inertia, nescience and delusion.
