Having revealed the divine qualities the Supreme Lord Krishna discloses  the
six demoniac properties which are  to  be  rejected  and  abandoned  in  all
situations. <i>Dambah</i> is ostentation or hypocrisy  by  pretentiously  parodying
righteousness. <i>Darpah</i> is pride caused by exaggerated egotism  due  to  one's
birth. <i>Abhinamah</i> is arrogance  due  to    education,  position  and  wealth.
<i>Krodah</i> is anger resulting from frustration of greed and lust and causes  one
to give the burning pain one feels to others. <i>Parusyam</i>  is  harshness,  lack
of kindness and merciless opposition to that which is righteous. <i>Ajnanam</i>  is
ignorance  in  determining  what  is  eternal  and  what  is  temporal   and
subsequently the inability to discriminate between  what  is  righteous  and
beneficial and what is unrighteous and harmful to one's own  existence.  The
copulative  <i>ca</i>  meaning  and,  includes  the  vices  such  as  fiendishness,
perversion, lust, greed, etc.
<p>
Thus the demoniac oppose  even  the  injunctions  and  prohibitions  of  the
eternal Vedic scriptures while concocting,  hypothecating  and  engaging  in
heinous activities that erode the eternal values of  righteousness  for  all
living beings in their  fiendish  attempt  to  degrade  and  degenerate  all
creation.
