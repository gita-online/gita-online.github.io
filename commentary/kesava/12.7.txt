Now Lord Krishna presents an alternative method for those who have  not  the
equanimity of mind to continuously think  of  Him  without  distraction.  He
instructs to  strive  to  remember  Him  while  restraining  the  mind  from
pursuing worldly affairs through repeated  practice  of  meditating  on  His
divine glories such as His infinite  beauty,  sweetness,  power,  compassion
etc. or by chanting His holy names with  affection  and  blissfully  singing
hymns to His glories. The particle <i>atha</i> meaning and if emphasises  there  is
another option.
