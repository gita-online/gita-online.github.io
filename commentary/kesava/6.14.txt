After  describing  the  results  of  meditation  Lord  Krishna   gives   the
regulations regarding the eating of food and the regimen  of  sleep  habits.
One who eats like a glutton or sleeps like a sloth as well as one who  fasts
too much and sleeps to little are never qualified to practise  <i>yoga</i>  or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness. In regard to food it is described by Pantajali  that
the stomach should be filled one-half with  food,  one-quarter  with  liquid
and one-quarter should be kept free for the movement of air.
