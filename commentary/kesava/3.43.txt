Now in conclusion Lord Krishna establishes the fact  that  one
should try to their utmost to destroy the powerful enemy known
as kama or lust. Knowing that kama is the mightiest enemy  one
must by withdrawing the senses, keeping the  mind  steady  and
the intellect resolute in sattva guna  the  mode  of  goodness
then slay this enemy kama which  will  attack  your  mind  and
senses in various ways  causing  one  to  fall  into  delusion
before oen becomes powerless  to  resist.  Kama  is  extremely
difficult to overpower and is tenacious and formidable yet  if
one dedicates all actions to  Lord  Krishna  with  their  mind
fixed on Him they can  overcome  it.  So  knowledge  of  Vedic
wisdom and meditation on the Supreme  Lord  are  combined  the
pancea to neutralise  kama from its location  in  the  senses,
mind and intellect and then destroy the great enemy  known  as
kama.  This  path  of  selfless  action   unattached   without
conception of rewards should be practiced according  to  oneâs
capacity and knowledge  as  a  means  of  gradually  achieving
renunciation.
