Lord Krishna explains that in all creation  there  are  only  two  types  of
beings  in  existence.  The  <i>ksarah</i>  or  perishable  and  the   <i>aksarah</i>   or
imperishable. The word <i>ksarah</i> denotes the mutable  physical  body  which  is
formed by the ingestion of  food  and  is  occupied  by  a  sentient  being.
Similarly the word  <i>aksarah</i>  denotes  an  immutable  presence,  eternal  and
immortal. Both words are used  in  the  singular  sense  because  they  each
comprise a category. All <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings in  existence  whether  in
physical or subtle  bodies  from  Brahma  down  to  a  blade  of  grass  are
temporary and transitory and form the category of the perishable.  The  <i>atma</i>
or immortal  soul  resding  within  the  etheric  heart  of  every  <i>jiva</i>  is
infallible and eternal and it forms the category of the imperishable.
