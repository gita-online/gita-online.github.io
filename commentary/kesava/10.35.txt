Among the descendants of the Vrishni lineage Lord Krishna's vibhuti or
divine, transcendental opulence is the son of Vasudeva. As Lord Krishna is
describing His vibhuti it is not logical that He would be would be
referring to Himself. The only other son of Vasudeva is Balarama who is the
first expansion of Lord Krishna and the direct source of all other avataras
or incarnations including Rama and Vishnu. So Lord Krishna's vibhuti as the
son of Vasudeva is the all powerful Balarama. Lord Krishna declares that
among the Pandavas His vibhuti is Arjuna and among self-realised sages His
vibhuti is Vedavyasa and among seers or those who are omniscient His
vibhuti is Usanah better known as Sukracarya, the preceptor of those born
in demoniac lines.
