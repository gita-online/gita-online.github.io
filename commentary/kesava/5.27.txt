Thus the entire scope of  selfless  actions  such  as  <i>yagnas</i>  offerings  of
worship to the Supreme Lord, various practices  of  austerities  along  with
processes of augmenting knowledge culminates in  to  equanimity,  detachment
from worldliness and <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul.  These  results
are  not  attained  independently  but  must  come  through  true   accurate
knowledge of the Supreme Lord Krishna, who  is  the  sole  bestower  of  all
rewards and the sovereign ruler of all existence and who  is  neutrally  the
benevolent well wisher of all living entities  such  a  knowledgeable  being
attains realisation of the final beatitude and <i>moksa</i>    or  liberation  from
material existence. This realisation will  be  further  spoken  of  by  Lord
Krishna in chapter fifteen.
