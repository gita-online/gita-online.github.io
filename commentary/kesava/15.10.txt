The <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul  is  extremely  difficult  to  perceive  but  the
aspirant  who  continuously  strives   to   achieve   it   through   focused
concentration and meditation will realise the <i>atma</i>  enshrined  within  their
etheric  heart  but  distinctly  different   from  the  physical  body.  The
ignorant enslaved by desires and sense gratification have  no  qualification
for  spiritual  pursuits  as  they  are  bewildered  by   the   ostentatious
encumbrances of the false ego and pursuing mundane goals in  the  phenomenal
world they are completely oblivious to the existence of the <i>atma.</i>
