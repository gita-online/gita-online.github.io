It could be postulated that if Duryodhana truly believes that  the  army  of
the Pandavas is invincible then why is he so persistent to fight with  them,
rather he should make peace and agree to a truce. Even  possessing  a  doubt
in his mind Duryodhana dauntlessly states to the contrary. With the  use  of
particle <i>tu</i> inferring contrariness he is affirming his superiority over  the
Pandava army due to the fact that Drona the instructor  of  the  leaders  of
both armies in the art of archery and the master of the science of  weaponry
is in his army fighting against the Pandavas, so under  his  protection  how
can their be any question of their army being invincible. You may  now  hear
about the excellence of our warriors, exalted in  knowledge,  valorous,  who
have our fullest confidence as they are fighting for us of  their  own  free
will. I shall name for you those excellent warriors so  you  will  know  who
they are and so that you will understand our position. The  word  <i>dvijottama</i>
meaning best of the twice born, Brahmans,  this  being  stated  indicates  a
concealed meaning implying that if Dronacaraya will not  fight  then  he  is
merely a Brahman who is only interested in eating the fine  food  served  at
the palace of Duryodhana.
