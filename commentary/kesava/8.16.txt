Those who are not endowed with <i>bhakti</i> or  loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna if they manage to reach the  heavenly  worlds  of  the  highest
material planet of Brahmaloka and others, because  they  have  to  reap  the
reactions of their various actions they are reborn again into the  world  of
mortals. Lord Krishna specifically mentions the highest  material  realm  of
Brahmaloka emphasising that the denizens  and  residents  of  these  regions
enjoy  the pleasures and delights found there and thus from there  downwards
through  the  14  levels  of  material  creation  all   are   subjected   to
reincarnation and <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and  death.  Yet  one
whose goal is the Supreme Lord Krishna who  is  the  source  of  the  entire
cosmic manifestation, upon attaining Him automatically are awarded <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation for ever more and never again subjected to <i>samsara.</i>  The  use  of
the particle <i>tu</i> meaning but emphasises  the  fact  that  there  is  a  great
difference between  the  devotees  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  the
votaries of other gods.
