Lord Krishna now clarifies the characteristics and qualities of one who  has
transcended the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature.  First  He  answers
by what symptoms does one transcend them? One who  is  neither  repulsed  by
what is unpleasant nor is attracted to that which is  pleasant  is  <i>prakasam</i>
or illuminated, filled with the light of spiritual wisdom which arises  from
<i>sattva guna</i> or the mode of goodness. Activity and endeavor arises from  <i>raja</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of passion and inertia and  stupor  arise  from  the  mode  of
ignorance. By the effects indicative of the three <i>gunas</i> all other  qualities
of them can be accordingly determined when they are  visibly  appearing  and
even as mental tendencies in the mind. So by this it can be  seen  that  one
who is free from aversion and attraction is able to transcend.

Next Lord Krishna clarifies the question what is the  behavior  and  conduct
of one who has transcended the three <i>gunas</i>? One who is perfectly focused  on
the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul within is merely a witness to what  transpires  in
the physical body. Such a  one  does  not  involve  themselves  anywhere  in
anything because they are unattached everything external and thus free  from
desire and and repulsion which arise from passion and ignorance. Such a  one
does not deviate from the their firm  and  steadfast  establishment  in  the
<i>atma.</i> Such a one is impervious to the desires for happiness and the  disdain
for unhappiness, accepting whatever comes equally  and  indifferently.  They
are free from bodily attachment and conceptions that the physical  body  has
any connection with the <i>atma.</i> Thus they understand that  they  never  engage
in any actions. Such a one equally reacts to adversity  and  felicity  alike
considering them both to be the same similarly  with  a  clod  of  earth,  a
precious jewel or a nugget of gold  are  just  different  manifestations  of
<i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum pervading  physical  existence.  In  the
same spirit one is neutral when exposed  to  pleasant  or  unpleasant  sense
objects and is <i>dhirah</i> or wise, not deviating from  discriminative  knowledge
even if by chance one is subjected to the effects of the three <i>gunas</i> due  to
circumstances. Such a one  views  censure  and  praise,  honor  and  infamy,
friend and foe as alike as well and is equal to all living entities  because
of being free from attachment to all actions  and  due  to   perceiving  the
<i>atma</i> within all beings.
