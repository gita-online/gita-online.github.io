Lord Krishna previously clarified that those who perform  actions  motivated
by desire incarnate and take birth in either the heavenly, hellish or  human
worlds; but those who have renounced the desire for rewards are not  subject
to this <i>karma</i> or reactions to actions. Now in order to  establish  the  fact
that  egoism  and  non-egoism  are   the  cause  of  actions  influenced  by
indiscrimination and discrimination, Lord Krishna revals the  five   factors
which cojointly contribute to the accomplishment of all action.  These  five
factors  accomplish all actions and must be understood by the aspirants  for
<i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from  material  existence  in  order  to  achieve  the
discriminative  knowledge  that  dissolves  the  sense   of   egoism   while
performing actions. These five factors  to  be  presented  will  remove  any
doubt regarding the liberating or binding effects of  actions.  The  Sankhya
philosophy  of  analytical  rationalism  established  by  Kapila   Deva   an
incarnation of Lord Krishna, explains these five  factors  in  detail  as  a
method of eradicating the effects of all actions. This method is by  precise
analytical ascertainment of the  cause  and  effect  of  all  actions.  Such
analysis includes  <i>atma</i>  the  immortal  soul,  <i>maya</i>  the  illusory  potency,
<i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum pervading physical existence,  <i>paramatma</i>
the Supreme Soul  etc.  and  illustrates  how  a  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  beings
relationship with each liberates or binds one in the material existence  and
thus is understood to be included in Vedanta.
<p>
The  five factors are the physical body, the five senses  such  eyes,  ears,
etc., the ego, the life  airs  which  govern  breathing  and  the  <i>atma</i>  the
controller of them all. The Vedanta Sutra II.III.XXXIII  beginning  <i>upadanat</i>
states: The <i>atma</i> of the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being at the death of the  physical
body takes the <i>pranas</i> along with it; therefore the <i>atma</i> is  the  controller.
Some assert without any basis that the controller is the insentient ego  but
this opinion should be rejected based upon the  evidence  cited  above.  For
how can the insentient  ego  be  responsible  for  the  physical  body,  the
senses, the life airs and itself as well along with  the  <i>atma</i>.  It  is  not
possible for the insentient to control the sentient, The controller  of  the
five factors is <i>atma</i> the individual immortal soul and the controller of  all
<i>atmas</i> simultaneously is <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul residing  with  the  <i>atma</i>
within the etheric  heart  of  all  living  entities.  Srila  Vedavyasa  has
confirmed  this  in  Vedanta  Sutras  II.III.XXXXI   beginning   <i>amso   nana</i>
<i>vyapadesa</i>:The <i>atma</i> is <i>vibhinamsa</i> an  infintessimal  expansion  of  <i>paramatma</i>
like  the rays of the sun.
