As to the answer to the question by what means is this  spiritual  knowledge
available Lord Krishna is revealing how to attain this  knowledge  which  is
altogether  different  from  actions  that  bestow  material   rewards.   He
instructs everyone to fall at the feet of a self-realised  beings  rendering
service to them with faith and devotion and inquire from them  with  a  pure
heart about the purpose of life, the true nature of a living being  and  how
to revive one's relationship with the Supreme Being? By these questions  and
by being pleased by one's sincere service such a  self-realised  being  will
guide and instruct one on matters related  to  the  ultimate  truth  because
they have direct experience and wisdom of this  and  thus  will  remove  all
doubts about: Who am I? Why was I born? What is  my  purpose  in  life?  The
self-realised being will dispel all these questions by proper reasoning  and
evidences from the Vedic scriptures and practical experience and reveal  the
nature of  the  individual  consciousness  and  its  relationship  with  the
ultimate consciousness which is the  goal  of  all  existence.  All  actions
culminate in knowledge when instructed by a self-realised  being  but  never
when instructed by those who  are  not  self-realised.  By  this  verse  the
ancient scriptural adage of : Let one humbly seek a spiritual master who  is
well learned in the Vedic scriptures and established  in  the  knowledge  of
the <i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence. The  plural
sense of the words <i>jnaninah</i> meaning those expert  in  the  Vedic  scriptures
and <i>darsinah</i> meaning those who realised the ultimate truth denotes that  all
self realised being will possess this spiritual knowledge.  It  also  infers
that if one approaches a person for enquiry and discovers that  this  person
is not self-realised and cannot give this  spiritual knowledge then one  may
approach a spiritual master who is self-realised to attain this knowledge.
