Now a question may asked as to whom is the mind a friend  and  for  whom  is
the mind an enemy? Lord Krishna clarifies that the mind  is  the  friend  to
that person who having  complete control over the physical body, the  senses
and the mind has conquered their lower nature. The mind is the enemy to  the
person who is unable to control the physical body, the senses and  the  mind
due to not having conquered their lower nature. As is  stated  by  the  sage
Parasara:  Man's  mentality  is  verily  the  root  cause  of  either  their
liberation or their bondage. The mind obsessed  with  sensual  pleasures  is
bondage whereas the mind devoid of the desire  to  enjoy  sensual  pleasures
leads to <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence.
