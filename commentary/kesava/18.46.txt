It may be postulated that if prescribed Vedic  activities  qualify  one  for
<i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence then one  should  abandon  deeds
which are violent and lethal and strive exclusively for <i>moksa.</i> Lord  Krishna
refutes this conception with the word <i>sahajam</i> or according to one's  natural
propensity. One should never relinquish their own ordained  duty  in  favour
of anothers because all endeavours are tainted by  some  defect  or  blemish
just as fire is tainted by smoke. Although dispelling darkness and  cold  by
providing heat and light fire is accompanied by smoke which burns  the  eyes
and irritates the nose, similarly in the quest for <i>moksa</i> there will be  some
difficulties and irritations but without clarity of intention and purity  of
heart it will not be possible for <i>moksa</i> to be  achieved.   Hence  on  should
perfom their natural  duty with the  intention  to  propitiate  the  Supreme
Lord according to qualification and  relinquish  all  desires  for  rewards.
When the heart  becomes  pure  then  all  imperfections  are  dissolved  and
dissappear. So by worshipping the Supreme Lord following one's  own  natural
prescribed duty one attains self-realisation and  achieves  <i>moksa.</i>  The  Isa
Upanisad, verse 11 beginning <i>vidyam cavidyam ca yas</i> states:  One  who  knows
what is nescience  and  what  is  transcendence  can  overcome  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death.
