The astute can perceive that if all the demigods comprise the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna's transcendental body and that He resides within each and every  one
of them as <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul as He does  in  all  sentient  beings;
then worship of them is indirect worship  of  Him  and  also  that  all  the
demigods devotees are indirectly the Supreme Lords devotees. So what is  the
cause of their falling into <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of  bith  and  death
without cessation. Just as Lord Krishna's  devotees  worship  Him  directly,
the devotees of the demigods such as Surya and Indra worship them  directly.
But because Lord Krishna is Himself eternal He can award  benedictions  that
are eternal  such  as  <i>moksa</i>  o  liberarion  from  <i>samsara.</i>  Contrarily  the
demigods themselves are not eternal so they cannot offer anything  to  their
votaries that is eternal and hence everything bestowed by them  has  a  time
limit and after it has expired such votaries are forced back  into  <i>samsara.</i>
In  an  unconscious,  indirect  way  the  devotees  of  the   demigods   are
worshipping the Supreme Lord but they are not worshipping Him in  accordance
with the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and so they  are  not  entitled
to receive eternal benedictions from Him as they are merely worshipping  the
demigods in accordance with the Vedic scriptures. The ignorant  worship  the
demigods, lesser  gods  and  even  impersonal  gods  profusely  without  any
reference to the Supreme Lord.
<p>
Oblivious to the reality that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord  of  All  and
that He exists omnipresent within and without all living entities;  whatever
ritual, ceremony or worship the ignorant  embark  upon  for  their  fruitive
desires has no real significance as there is no propitiation to the  Supreme
Lord and has no real meaning as it is devoid of knowledge of Him.
