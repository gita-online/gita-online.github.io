A question may be raised  that  if  the  controlled  mind  becomes  suddenly
tempestuous and restless what should be  done?  Lord  Krishna  answers  this
question here. The mind must  be  immediately  rescued  back  from  whatever
sense object that caused the mind to deviate and this should be  done  again
and again until the mind becomes fixed in the <i>atma</i> or soul.
