It may be further asked that if Lord Krishna is the  exclusive  bestower  of
the goal of life then why is not every one following Him. To alleviate  such
a doubt Lord Krishna answers that most people are engaged in <i>karma  yoga</i>  or
the performance of prescribed duties of their caste and station.  Performing
myriad of actions they seek  material  results  from  their  efforts.  These
material benefits are beseeched in the forms of wealth, power,  good  health
and such. For these things they worship lesser gods for  quick  results  and
not Lord Krishna. But for <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  the  results  do  not  come
quickly as this knowledge must refined and perfected picking  up  where  one
left off in a previous birth through many lifetimes.  The  purport  is  that
most people worship various others because in their present life  they  have
no knowledge of and no intrinsic interest in <i>moksa.</i>
