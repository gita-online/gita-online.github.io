Now Lord Krishna explains that  not  withstanding  the  positive  merits  or
negative demerits of actions performed by the mind,  speech  and  body.  One
who  is  untrained,  unrestrained  and  undeveloped  is  due  to   lack   of
instructions from the Vaisnava spiritual master who  teaches  the  knowledge
and import of the Vedic scriptures. Such ignorant and  misguided  fools  who
ignore  the  Vaisnava  spiritual  master  who  is  always  in  the  line  of
authorised  disciplic  succession  from   one   of   the   four   authorised
<i>sampradayas</i> or channels of spiritual knowledge as  confirmed  in  the  Padma
Purana and Garga Samhita; believe that they alone  are  the  sole  cause  of
their  actions  and  not  the  five  previously  mentioned   factors.   Such
miscreants  are so  deluded  by  this  distorted  mentality  that  they  are
oblivious to  the  fact  that  their  very  existence  and  everything  else
existing in creation is irrevocably dependent upon the Supreme Lord.
