Anyway let it be so, Durydhana concedes and concludes that every one of  the
soldiers in his battalions can defeat the army of  the  Pandavas  headed  by
Dhristadyumna and that Drona should have no doubts about this  as  they  are
not invincible. This he is stating in this  verse  and  the  next  2  verses
describing the might  and  valour  of  the  individual  warriors  among  the
Pandava ranks. In their army are  many  valiant  heroes,  hence  it  is  not
possible for their army to be defeated by anyone single-handed. The  valiant
warriors Yuyudhana known as Satyaki, King Virata,  Drupada  and  others  are
all mighty bowman and moreover they are not less skilled in the  science  of
warfare but equal to Bhima and Arjuna. The use of the description  <i>maharatha</i>
which confirms a warrior who is able to defeat in  battle  10,000  opponents
at a time applies to all three warriors as well as Arjuna and Bhima.
