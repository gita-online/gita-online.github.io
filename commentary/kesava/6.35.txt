In order to  dispel  all  doubts  Lord  Krishna  answers  this  question  by
addressing Arjuna in a very  affectionate  way  by  use  of  the  word  <i>tata</i>
meaning dear one. Then He confirms to him  that  there  is  no  downfall  or
setback in the present life or in the next life for an aspirant of <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from the material existence who has abandoned the path  of  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic activities for attaining  heaven  in  exchange  for
the sake of cultivating meditation and <i>atma tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the
soul. Even if one fails to reach perfection due to digressing from the  path
by negligence in dispassion or  lethargy  in  practice  still  there  is  no
demerits or diminution because there was no hankering for rewards  and  thus
no reactions to suffer. If a person  is  worshipping  the  demigods  with  a
desire to obtain some rewards and does not get it, then that person  has  to
accept a reaction anyway because they deviated from the path right from  the
very start. Hence in  their  present  life  they  feel  censure  and  infamy
because the reward could not be gained to be enjoyed. But in the  next  life
after death one must  still  receive  the  reaction  for  seeking  to  enjoy
independently of the Supreme Lord regardless of receiving it or not and  the
reaction will not be pleasant in the next life maybe even taking a birth  as
an animal. It is like a thief who goes  to  the  market  to  steal  and  get
caught before getting away still the thief  is  bound  to  be  punished  for
attempting the action without having succeeded. But this will never  be  the
situation for one who begins the practice of <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness. One who treads the  path  of  <i>yoga</i>  and  righteousness  never
meets with an inauspicious or evil destiny.

The word <i>tata</i> is derived from the  word  <i>tan</i>  meaning  to  expand.  One  who
expands himself further is known as <i>tat</i> and one who expands himself  as  the
son is the father. Thus the father himself is <i>tata</i> expanding himself as  the
son. So both the father and the son are addressed as  <i>tata.</i>  As  an  analogy
the disciple is also accepted as the son by the  <i>guru</i>  or  spiritual  master
and thus the use of the word <i>tata</i> illustrates the  extreme  mercy  the  <i>guru</i>
gives to the disciple as Lord Krishna is giving to Arjuna.
