In answer to these questions the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  replies  in  three
verses. He answers three of the questions with  the  words  <i>aksaram  paramam</i>
meaning the supreme indestructible reality which is imperishable  and  never
is destroyed and is the essence in  totality of all <i>atmas</i> or  souls  of  all
embodied beings. The Brhadaranyaka Upanisad IV.V.XIV states  that  the  <i>atma</i>
is eternal and verily indestructible. The <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  is  in  a
perpetual state of bondage and is explained in the Subala Upanisad as  such:
The unmanifest descends into the embodied soul and the embodied  soul  sinks
into the darkness of nescience. But in this verse the word  <i>paramam</i>  meaning
supreme qualifies the term <i>aksaram</i>  and so its  imperishable  nature  refers
to the <i>atma</i> not associated with or disconnected from primordial  matter  and
as such the only perception manifesting is realisation of the <i>atma</i>  and  one
becomes  omniscient. Although in scriptural passages such  as  Brhadaranyaka
Upanisad IV.IV.XXII stating O`Garga the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spirirtual  substratum
pervading all existence is verily indestructible. In this case it refers  to
the ultimate reality; but not here because Lord Krishna Himself  will  speak
later in chapter  15,  verse  16  and  17of  this  indestructible  as  being
different from the two types of created beings those who are perishable  and
those who are imperishable as He is exalted and being  distinctly  different
from both is designated as the Supreme Being  and  Supreme  Personality.  So
here <i>akarsam</i> refers to the individual <i>atma</i> and when matter  merges  with  it
then it becomes embodied  and  is  referred  to  as  <i>adhyatma</i>  which  is   a
combination of matter, senses, intelligence and subtle elements  surrounding
enveloping the <i>atma.</i> Both the <i>atma</i> and matter should  be  well  comprehended
by those aspirants for <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence in  order
to know what in  life  should  be  accepted  and  what  in  life  should  be
rejected. Also one should be clear  as  to  the  discharge  of  one's  daily
duties and <i>yagna</i> or worship in propitiation and  whether  such  propitiation
should be offered to demigods like <i>Indra</i> the celestial chief  of  <i>Surya</i>  the
sungod or exclusively to the Supreme Lord.  All  actions  of  various  types
offered to anything other than the Supreme Lord have a reaction attached  to
them and are known as <i>karma</i> or reactions to actions  and  by  these  actions
all types of movable and immovable beings are  coming  into  existence.  The
Manu Samhita III. LXXVI states that  the  oblations  of  <i>ghee</i>  or  clarified
butter and <i>havi</i> or seed grains reach unto the sun where results in rain  and
from rain grows food and from food human beings. This should  be  understood
by the aspirants for <i>moksa</i> with discrimination as one of the  Vedic  rituals
not required for them to accept.
