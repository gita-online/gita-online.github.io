The Supreme Lord Krishna being thus requested  to  explain  the  reason  for
manifesting such a frightening aspect of His <i>visvarupa</i> or  divine  universal
form states <i>kalo'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho</i> meaning  He  is  all  powerful
time destroyer of all the worlds. By Lord Krishna's desire, imbued with  His
power and might, time itself  will  destroy  all  these  armies  arrayed  in
battle even without Arjuna participating in  the  fight.  The  Kaurava  army
along with their  commanders such as Duryodhana, Bhishma and Drona will  not
survive and will all be slain
