From now until the end of the chapter the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  enumerates
His <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental opulence. He reveals He is  Vishnu  of
the 12 Adityas, All solar orbs whose  rays  illuminates  unlimited  galaxies
and universes. He is  the  Parivaha  wind  which  precedes  all  the  others
throughout  space  bearing  the  name  <i>Marici</i>  and  among  <i>naksatranams</i>   or
different constellations exercising their sphere of influence  Lord  Krishna
is the moon which is superior to all of them in influence.
