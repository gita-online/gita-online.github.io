In order to dissolve the need to  summarise  the  scriptural  texts  of  the
entire Simad Bhagavad-Gita which  is  poignant  and  deep  in  meaning.  The
Supreme Lord Krishna  out  of  magnanimous  compassion  refined  it  to  its
essence with the words <i>sarva guhyataman</i> the most confidential of  all.  This
ultimate essence He will reveal in the next two verses. It may  be  wondered
why is Lord Krishna emphasising that the ultimate essence is  so  much  more
confidential then all the other previous confidential teachings.  It  is  to
illustrate just how dear and precious his beloved  devotees are to  Him.  So
He Himself most benevolently reveals the  essence which is  the  very  heart
and soul of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita for  the  ultimate  benefit  and  perpetual
welfare of His devotees.
