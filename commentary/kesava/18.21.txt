That knowledge which mechanically clings to the stagnating mentality  that
there is nothing better than their conception, that there is nothing  more
to discover, that there is no other path but theirs. Who perform the  most
trivial types of worship merely for their own selfish goals.  Who  worship
impersonal conceptions  of  God  without  qualities  and  attributes.  Who
worship pagan  forms symbolising God. Who worship ghosts, spirits, goblins
and  demons.  Who  irrationally  dedicate  their  lives  to  such  mundane
delusions without any tangible objective while  foolishly  imagining  they
are accomplishing results of great import. Such <i>jivas</i> or  embodied  beings
are inescably enslaved in <i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance.
