The ultimate substance of the form of the <i>atma</i> is completely  distinct  from
<i>prakriti</i> or the material substrtatum  pervading  existence  and  is  without
birth and death. Thus it better then even the Cosmic Egg from where  if  one
surmounts it there is also  no  return  to  material  existence.  This  Lord
Krishna is indicating in this verse and the next by the words  <i>paras  tasmat</i>
meaning superior to that. His  state  is  superior  because  He  is  totally
separate from <i>avyakta</i>  the  unmanifest  that  emantes  from  Brahma  and  is
invariably connected  to  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading
physical existence and the cause of  the myriad of multitudes of  variegated
created beings alluded to  in  the  previous  verse.  Yet  Lord  Krishna  is
revealing that there is another superior <i>avyakta</i> which is  different,  being
eternal and full of consciousness which never perishes and is  imperceptible
by any means and measure of proof except by the  evidence  revealed  in  the
Vedic scriptures. This superior <i>avyakta</i> coming from Him is never subject  to
destruction even when all the worlds and universes along  with  all  movable
and immovable beings are destroyed.
