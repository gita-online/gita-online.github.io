The reality about  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  being  confirmed  to  be
precisely  what  He  has  declared  it  to  be,  the  total  repository   of
extraordinary, phenomenal power and majesty. The word <i>evam</i>  means  it  is  a
certainty and denotes that it should not be construed  that  Arjuna  has  no
faith in Lord Krishna because he desires to  see  His  <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine
universal  form  possessed  of  full  power,  energy,  glory,  dominion  and
effulgence.
