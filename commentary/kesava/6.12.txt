After the description of the seat Lord Krishna speaks of the posture of  the
body. The word <i>samam</i> means straight and this is how the back, neck and  head
should be.  They  should  never  be  bent  or  hunched.  The  compound  word
<i>bramacari-vrate</i> means one must be observing strict celibacy  which  controls
the eightfold emotions related to the  generating  organ.  The  Agni  Purana
states that the eightfold emotions regarding sexual congress  are:  thinking
about it, talking about it, joking about it, envisioning it, desiring to  do
it, wooing to get one interested for it, enticing one interested  to  do  it
and finally engaging with another in sexual congress. All these things  must
be thoroughly scourged and completely purged if  one  is  to  be  considered
celibate. In this way one should <i>yukta asita mat-parah</i> meaning to  sit  with
legs crossed  in  a  lotus  position  or  half  lotus  position  and  engage
themselves in meditation of the Supreme Lord, becoming immersed in Him,  who
bestows  ultimate bliss and who is the ultimate goal of human endeavour  and
existence.
