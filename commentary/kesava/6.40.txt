Does  such  a  <i>yogi</i>  or  one  perfecting  the  science  of  the   individual
consciousness attaining communion with  the  ultimate  consciousness  become
finally established in  <i>yoga</i>  in  their  present  birth  after  transcending
prescribed Vedic activities for rewards? Is  such  a  person  qualified  for
<i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence in this life or the  next?  Lord
Krishna uses the words <i>prayatmad yatmanas</i> meaning  endeavouring  diligently.
Because a person deviated from <i>yoga</i> in the past life due to  negligence  and
distraction they must pick up where they left  off  with  even  more  effort
than  before  as  to  not  be  deviated  again.  One  should  sincerely  and
determinedly make up their mind to  attain  perfection  in  this  very  life
purging themselves of all impurities and neutralising all obstructions  from
self realisation with diligent endeavour so the opportunity for  development
is not lost in this birth or in future births  until  at  last  one  attains
<i>moksa.</i>
