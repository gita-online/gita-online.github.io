Lord Krishna now reveals the glories of the divine sound SAT which  is  also
a name for the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all existence.  SAT
is well established throughout the Vedic scriptures as the  epitome  of  the
ultimate truth and  always  recited  in  Vedic  rituals.  SAT  confirms  the
ultimate reality and extinguishes any doubt or misconception about the  non-
existence of that  ultimate  reality  which  manifests  all  realities.  SAT
represents perpetual goodness in the eternal spiritual  worlds  as  well  as
the temporary material worlds.  The  performance  of  all  prescribed  Vedic
activities such as marriage or birth ceremonies is known to be SAT.  SAT  is
also devotion to the Supreme  Lord  in  the  form  of  planting  <i>Tulasi</i>  and
offering her leaves unto the Supreme Lord<i>,</i> picking flowers for garlands  for
the Supreme Lord. Constructing temples  for  the  Supreme  Lord,  collecting
wealth for the Supreme Lord, cleaning  the  temple  floor  for  the  Supreme
Lord, singing, dancing and playing  musical  instruments  before  the  diety
form of the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His aurthorised  incarnations  as
revealed in Vedic scriptures is all SAT as well. Any  activity  directly  or
indirectly related to the service, pleasure and satisfaction of the  Supreme
Lord as revealed in Vedic scriptures is also deemed as SAT.    During  <i>yagna</i>
or propitiation and worship by the  Vaisnavas  and  brahmanas  the  priestly
class, <i>tapah</i> or austerities by the <i>ksatriyas</i> the  royal  warrior  class  and
the <i>danam</i> or charity by the merchant class the absence of the conception  of
rewards for services rendered is SAT.
<p>
Here the particles <i>sa iti ca</i> referring to  SAT  is  used  twice.  The  first
usage denotes limitation by the words <i>karma ca eva</i> meaning matter  of  duty.
The second usage denotes unlimited by the  words  <i>tad-arthyiam</i>  meaning  for
the pleasure of the Supreme Lord.  Thus  it  has  been  established  by  the
parallel logic of opposites that activities  devoted  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna or any of His authorised incarnations and expansions  always  follow
<i>sanatan dharma</i> or  eternal  righteousness  and  can  never  be  unrighteous.
Whereas activities not devoted to the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  regardless  of
how noble and well meaning they may be are never situated  in  righteousness
because they exclude Him.
<p>
The  Chandogya  Upanisad   VIII.I.VI   beginning   <i>tad   yatheha   karmajito</i>
<i>lokah</i> states: Those who at the time of death  depart  their  bodies  without
realising the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul which is the  goal  of  human  existence
for them <i>moksa</i> or liberation does not exist anywhere. But those  who  depart
their physical body at the time of  death  having  realised  the  <i>atma</i>  have
achieved the goal of human existence and experience <i>moksa</i> everywhere in  all
worlds.  What  could  be  more  pathetic  and  sorrowful   then   performing
prodigious austerities for impermanent results and  wasting  one's  life  in
the pursuit and acquisition of temporary materialistic  rewards  which  have
absolutely no value longer then the moment of death in a brief span of  life
not even reaching 100 years.
<p>
So  even  by  performing  prescribed  Vedic   activities   perfectly   while
harbouring desires for fame, wealth, power and dominion  in  this  life;  or
performed for entry into the heavenly planets in  the  next  life  to  enjoy
without the burdens of old age and disease  and  fully  satisfy  the  senses
with exquisite and beautiful heavenly maidens who want  to  enjoy  fully  as
well. All these thingy are as ephemeral as mist in the sun. When the  merits
of such activities are exhausted such <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  incarnate
again in the material worlds of mortals to reap what they sow. In  this  way
addicted to the rituals of the Vedic scriptures and attached to the  rewards
of the heavenly planets they remain revolving in the orbit  of  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death incessantly.  Contrarily  all  activities
dedicated to the Supreme Lord for His  exclusive  satisfaction  without  the
slightest desire for  any  reward  are  of  an  eternal  nature  and  bestow
immeasurable  benefit.  Lord  Krishna  confirms  in  chapter  18  verse   56
beginning:  <i>sarva-karmanyapi  sada</i>  meaning:  Although   always   performing
unlimited activities, by the mercy of the Supreme Lord and protected by  Him
one assuredly achieves the eternal, imperishable spiritual realm.
<p>
Thus it has been established that vibrating the  divine  and  transcendental
sounds of OM TAT SAT at the commencement of all Vedic  activities  comprised
in the ordinances and injunctions prescribed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  is
eternally  auspicious;  if  performed  with  devotion  for   the   exclusive
satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Krishna with full faith in Him  or  any  of
His authorised incarnations and expansions. In this way  by  the  power  and
potency invested in OM TAT SAT all Vedic activities are insured success  and
confer eternal benedictions for the highest good of creation and all  living
entities.
