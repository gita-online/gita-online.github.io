If one wants to understand exactly when performing <i>karma yoga</i> or  prescribed
Vedic activities transforms itself to the heights  of  <i>dhyana  yoga</i>  or  the
science of the individual soul attaining communion with  the  ultimate  soul
by meditation is now revealed. Lord Krishna speaks  the  words:  <i>na  karmasi</i>
<i>anusajjate</i> meaning when one no longer craves or  is  inclined  to  make  any
effort for sense objects. Such a  person  thinks  why  should  I  strive  to
obtain  pleasures  which  are  here  today  and  gone  tomorrow  being  only
temporary?  Then  with  constant  endeavour   one   ceases   to   look   for
opportunities  to  facilitate  favourable  circumstances  to  enjoy  sensual
pleasures and evenually evaporates all thoughts of  enjoying  sense  objects
along with dissolving the memories  of  previous  enjoyments.  Only  such  a
being is considered to be firmly established in <i>yoga</i> or the science  of  the
individual soul attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness.
