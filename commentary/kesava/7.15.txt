The question could arise from the previous verse that if  devotion  to  Lord
Krishna is the  way  to  salvation  then  what  is  stopping  everyone  from
recognising  this  reality  and  taking  refuge  in  Him  by  following  the
teachings of  the  bonafide  spiritual  master  from  the  authorised  Vedic
scriptures and avail themselves to the  means  to  surmount  this  difficult
<i>maya</i>  which  is  the  root  cause  of  perpetual  bondage  in  the  material
existence. Lord Krishna states <i>duskrtino</i> or miscreants  in  nescience  being
of four types do not surrender to the Supreme Lord.
<p>
<i>1) mudhahs</i> are grossly foolish persons pursuing material gains  like  beasts
of burden
<i>2) naradhamas</i> are the lowest level of society  bereft  of   even  any  moral
principles
<i>3) mayayapahrta-jnana</i> are empirical philosophers  deluded  by  the  illusory
energy
<i>4) asuram bhavam asrita</i> are those of demoniac nature engaged  in  abominable
activities
<p>
Such miscreants through open deceit and covert  subterfuge  fabricate  false
doctrines and  concoct erroneous philosophies to  contradict  the  truth  of
the Supreme Lords glories, attributes and  qualities  as  confirmed  in  the
Vedic scriptures. Such intentional  deceptions  upon  unsuspecting  humanity
are <i>aparadhas</i> or heinous offences against the Supreme  Lord  the  source  of
all existence. These activities causes them to be infected  and  overwhelmed
with sinful reactions which propels them to  embrace  a  demoniac  mentality
with the propensity to perform evil and diabolical  activities  against  all
created beings. Thus for them it is impossible to accept  the  Supreme  Lord
and even go out of their way to oppose Him and His  devotees  whenever  they
have the opportunity. These demons assuming various human forms as  well  as
other hybrid forms have been antagonistic to the  Supreme  Lord  since  time
immemorial. They are adverse to hearing about the nature,  form,  qualities,
pastimes and powers of the Supreme Lord and they blaspheme and minimise  Him
in every way possible to them. Because of this due to their ignorance  their
accumulation of sins multiplies exigently effecting  that  they  permanently
remain unfit to accept the truth of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  paramount
position as the Supreme controller of all  creation.  Although  many  demons
are intelligent enough to be able to comprehend  the  eternal  knowledge  of
divinity as  revealed  exclusively  within  the  Vedic  scriptures;  to  the
contrary they  promote  their  own  deluded  philosophies  in  the  name  of
religion always zealously keeping their gods  without  form,  qualities  and
personality insuring that  their  gods  are  perpetually  unfathomable,  and
unreachable, hence permanently unattainable for humanity.  Deluded  by  <i>maya</i>
or illusory impressions superimposed upon the mind and being only  engrossed
in their external senses such demons have no  chance  in  surrendering  unto
the Supreme Lord Krishna and recognising and accepting Him  as  the  Supreme
Controller of all.
