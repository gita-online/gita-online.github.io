Lord Krishna states the qualifications of the <i>yogi</i>  or  one  perfecting  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness and why such  a  birth  mentioned  in  the  preceding
verse is so rare. It is because the potent impression  of  one's  past  life
<i>yoga</i> practices has such efficacy that one regains  their  spiritual  insight
and an awakening occurs regarding meditation on the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul.  It  is
exactly like waking up in the  morning  after  sleeping  during  the  night.
After such an awakening a person recognises the place where  they  left  off
last life and wholeheartedly and  determinedly  strives  for  perfection  in
<i>yoga</i> in their present life without reservation.
