Not only would Arjunas estimation wane in the assembly  of  mighty  warriors
but here Lord Krishna uses the word nindantah  meaning  to  vilify.  Arjunas
enemies such as Duryodhana  would say many unbecoming things about him  such
as: Look at the impotent Arjuna fleeing the battlefield like a dog with  its
tail between its legs and  Karna would smirkingly  add that although  Arjuna
was very valiant in the past now fearing our might  he  has  become  feeble-
hearted and so he expeditiously leaves the  battlefield  like  a  coward  to
save his own life. Lord Krishna asks Arjuna what can be  more  painful  than
this?
