If one is unable to even consistently endeavour  to  remember  Lord  Krishna
while restraining the mind from pursuing the objects of the senses  then  He
offers an easier method which is to  perform  activities  dedicated  to  Him
such as chanting His holy names, singing hymns of praise to  Him  alone  and
with others, constructing temples for His deity  forms,  cultivating  Tulasi
gardens for His worship, growing flowers and  vegetables  for  His  service,
cow protection, offering <i>dhupa</i> or incense, <i>dhipa</i> or  ghee  lamps,  <i>puspa</i>  or
flowers, circumambulation of His holy pastime places and <i>dhama's</i> or  abodes,
etc. By perfoming  such  actions  for  the  exclusive  satisfaction  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna one's mind will become steady and soon be able  to  fix
its focus exclusively upon the Supreme Lord and  subsequent  realisation  of
Him will manifest within the heart.
