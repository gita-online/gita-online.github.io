In the preceding chapter the Supreme Lord Krishna  described  the  state  of
bondage the <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  is  forced  to  undergo  due  to  being
controlled by the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature  which  keeps  one
revolving in <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death. At the  end  of
the chapter He revealed that the only way to  become  eligible  to  overcome
the three <i>gunas</i> was by <i>bhakti yoga</i> which is exclusive loving  devotion  unto
the Supreme Lord. Indeed one who  everyday  consistently  without  cessation
worships Lord Krishna with the yoga of exclusive devotion or also to any  of
His authoratative <i>avatars</i> or incarnations as revealed in  Vedic  scriptures,
certainly becomes eligible for achieving the consciousness  of  the  <i>brahman</i>
or spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence  and  attain  the  eternal
association of the Supreme Lord in the immortal spiritual worlds.
<p>
Now in this chapter He speaks about the Supreme Lords position as  paramount
to all establishing Him as the highest being   and   as  thus  His  original
spiritual form is the quintessence of all worship along with His  authorised
<i>avatars</i> or incarnations as revealed in Vedic scriptures. The  Supreme  Lords
form is naturally situated in spiritual  perfection  endowed  with  infinite
auspicious attributes and qualities far above His external  energy  <i>prakriti</i>
or the material substratum pervading  physical  existence  and  beyond  the
dualities of perishable and imperishable.
<p>
Lord Krishna  elucidates that the imperishable  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  is
eligible for attaining the supreme consciousness of  the  <i>brahman</i>  and  that
they are both  direct  portions  of  Himself  and  that  only  by  exclusive
devotion to the Supreme Lord is one able to remove the  bondage  of  <i>samsara</i>
the perpetual cycle of birth and death which  is  indicative  of  detachment
from all other desires and pursuits.  This  is  why  in  order  to  properly
emphasise detachment the Supreme Lord uses the metaphor of the  <i>asvattha</i>  or
banyan tree which represents material existence  and  speaks  of  detachment
as the weapon cutting the knots of bondage asunder.  One who  perceives  the
reality that this <i>asvattha</i> tree which is transitory existence and  which  is
declared in the Katha Upanisad II.III.I beginning <i>urdhva  mulo  avak  shakha</i>
meaning: This ancient tree with roots  upwards  and  branches  downwards  is
certainly transient. Such a  tree  appears  imperishable  due  to  its  ever
flowing current of <i>samsara</i> which dissolves with <i>atma tattva</i>  or  realisation
of the soul. The beginning or source are the roots comprising the <i>jiva's</i>  or
embodied being comprised of the three <i>gunas</i> or   modes  of  material  nature
originating from <i>prakriti</i> which is  the  external  energy  of  the  primeval
Supreme Lord and far above and beyond  Brahma's  heavenly  planet  known  as
Satyaloka although it is the seventh and topmost   planet  in  the  material
creation. But a devotee of  Lord Krishna transcends all the material  worlds
and all the heavenly  worlds  and  achieves  the  eternal  spiritual  worlds
attaining association with the Supreme Lord. It is there in the form of  the
<i>atma</i> or the immortal soul that is the starting point of this  <i>asvattha</i>  tree
representing material existence and acceptance  of  a  material  body  by  a
<i>jiva.</i> With its branches upwards symbolises the fruits or  rewards  of  <i>karma</i>
or reactions to actions which are incurred by residence in one of the  seven
lower or seven higher totalling 14  worlds.  Beginning  with  Satyaloka  and
descending down through seven worlds until reaching the  seven  subterranean
worlds ending with Pataloka. The leaves are symbolised  by  the  injunctions
and prohibitions of  the  Vedic  scriptures.  This  is  because  a  tree  is
nourished by its leaves and the <i>jivas</i> who follow  the  injunctions  enjoined
in the Vedic scriptures are also nourished by this tree and the tree  itself
prospers by the optional rituals performed  by  the  <i>jivas.</i>  The  Apastambha
Srauta Sutra X:II:I states: This <i>asvattha</i>  tree  of  material  existence  is
resorted to by humans full of  desires for rewards in its shade in the  form
of fruitive actions.
<p>
The  essence  is  that  this  tree  of  material  existence  is  rooted   in
<i>prakriti</i> comprised of the three <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature.  Its
branches are  the  fourteen  material  worlds  which  provide  pleasure  and
enjoyments based on the performance of meritorious  deeds.  Its  leaves  are
the Vedic scriptures by whose injunctions when followed lead to  its  growth
and allow its performers to enjoy their rewards for all the innumerable  and
uncountable <i>jivas</i> from Brahma downwards. Thus  the  tree  is  transitory  by
nature but appears everlasting because of its perpetual flowing  in  <i>samsara</i>
and because it is only by knowledge of the Supreme Lord Krishna  and  <i>bhakti</i>
or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to  Him  which  is   all   <i>jivas</i>   natural,
constitutional position and an eternal  activity;  that  this  tree  can  be
transcended. This  esoteric wisdom  is  verily  the  essence  of  the  Vedic
scriptures  and  one  who  comprehends  and  realises  this  in  reality  is
factually a knower of the Vedas.
