In this way Lord Krishna is presenting the results one receives while  being
continuously immersed in the <i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all
existence  while  performing  every  action  as  <i>yagna</i>   or   offering   and
propitiation to the Supreme Lord. To show  the  superiority  of  this  <i>yagna</i>
over all others  Lord  Krishna  presents  various  types  of  <i>yagnas</i>  in  by
different <i>yogis</i> or those striving to have their individual consciousness  in
communion with the ultimate consciousness, in the next  eight  verses.  Here
worship of the demigods such as Indra and Surya for the desire  of  material
results is done by <i>yogis</i> of little  knowledge.  Others  offer  oblations  of
<i>ghee</i> or clarified butter and grains  into  the  fire  as  offerings  to  the
<i>Brahman</i> but they see only the fire as a form of  the  <i>Brahman</i>  and  not  the
performer, the offerings and utensils connected with the <i>yagna.</i>  This  shows
that these <i>yogis</i> are on a lower platform than those  <i>yogis</i>  referred  to  in
the previous verse who see everything connected to  the  act  of   <i>yagna</i>  as
part of the <i>Brahman.</i>
