In the fifth  chapter  Lord  Krishna  described  and  praised  the  path  of
selfless action as well as the  path  of  knowledge.  At  the  very  end  of
chapter five the procedures for meditation were introduced  briefly  in  two
verses.  Here  in  this  chapter  they  are  elaborated  further.  One   may
hypothesise that since actions are of a lower order then  renunciation  must
be superior. To alleviate such ideas Lord Krishna speaks the word  <i>anasritah</i>
or without expecting. Performance of obligatory prescribed Vedic  activities
and occasional ones like the appearance celebrations  of  the  Supreme  Lord
without hankering for rewards or benefits is true renunciation and  not  for
one who has renounced the rituals of the sacred fire and  other  magnanimous
activities. Such a person is neither  a  renunciate  or  a  yogi.  Only  the
person who performs prescribed Vedic activities renouncing all  desires  for
rewards is regarded as a renunciate and a yogi because they  have  qualified
themselves as competent in both disciplines simultaneously.
