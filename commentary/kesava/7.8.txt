Now to illustrate that He is the form of all because He is the <i>atma</i> or  soul
of all, Lord Krishna reveals in the next five verses how He is  situated  as

<i>OM.</i> He is the  origin  of  all  the  Vedas  and  the  source  of  the  Vedic
utterances which become objects of hearing. He is the subtle casual form  in
ether and the potency of competence in men.
