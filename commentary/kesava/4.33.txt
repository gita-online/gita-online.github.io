Because various types of <i>yagnas</i> or offerings of worship  have  been  equally
delineated by Lord Krishna, it  is  appropriate  to  include  the  <i>yagna</i>  of
knowledge. In order to remove the undesirable contingency of resemblance  to
the others, Lord Krishna instructs that <i>yagna</i> in the form  of  knowledge  is
far superior to <i>yagnas</i> performed with material ingredients to the  demi-gods
designated by their names  and  which  bestow  only  trivial  rewards  of  a
transitory material nature. For the performer  of  the  <i>yagna</i>  of  knowledge
realises that all the  components  of  action  without  exception  in  their
entirety along with their cause and effect culminate  in  the  knowledge  of
everything being the manifestation of the eternal  form  and  attributes  of
the eternal <i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence.
Such a person sees everything  as  <i>Brahman</i>  and  is  unobstructed  achieving
everything. In the Bhagavad Purana it is  stated  that:  The  performers  of
austerities, the makers of pilgrimages, the chanters of mantras, the  givers
of donations and others never reachs the achievement of that being  who  has
even one percentage of Vedic knowledge.
