Lord Krishna is emphasising that accompanying spiritual knowledge  from  the
Vedic scriptures there must be personal realisation also.  This  will  occur
naturally when one is relieved of all doubts and after  adequate  reflection
and introspection. Such a person is steadfast  and  serene  even  if  coming
upon something extraordinary by chance. This is because such a one  is  free
from all desires and cravings. The external functions  of  the  senses  have
been mastered and under control. Everything is  envisioned  equally  without
considering its external value, hence one neither  avoids  the  unfavourable
nor seeks the favourable. Such a  person  is  considered  a  <i>yogi</i>  or  whose
individual  consciousness  has  attained   communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness.
