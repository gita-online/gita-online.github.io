The demoniac falsely state that creation is godless and  completely  unreal,
without any foundation or creator. They  have  no  knowledge  of  the  Vedic
scriptures which ascertains all  variables  perceived  and  unperceived  and
gives as evidence  countless  examples  which  we  will  validate  now.  The
Vedanta Sutra II.I.XVI beginning <i>sattva ca varasya</i>  states:  Even  prior  to
the manifestation of the effect its existence is inherent in the cause.  The
Chandogya Upanisad VI.II.I beginning <i>sadeva samye  damagra</i>  states:  In  the
beginning was only the Supreme Lord alone for before creation there was non-
existence of any reality  and  from  this  non-existence  everything  became
manifest. It is to be understood that non-existence is <i>mahattattva</i> the  most
subtle and infinitesimal sub-atomic essence where  name  and  form  have  no
scope to manifest. This is  confirmed  again  in  Vedanta  Sutra  II.I.XVIII
beginning <i>yukteli savdanara ca</i> which  states:  Through  studying  verses  in
Vedic scriptures with unbiased erudition it can be ascertained that <i>asat</i>  or
non-existence  refers  to  the  subtlest  state  of   existence   known   as
<i>mahattattva.</i> So from these examples it can be determined  that  creation  is
absolutely real and  the  erroneous  conceptions  of  the  demoniac  to  the
contrary are based on the supposition that the effect must  be  non-existent
because the cause is non-existent and this has now been proven to be  false.
The Taittiriya Upanisad II.VII.I  beginning  <i>asadva  idamagre  asit</i>  states:
Creation was ever existent before its manifestation in its <i>mahattattva</i>  form
and when the Supreme Lord wills it to manifest it appears.  The  meaning  of
the word <i>asatyam</i> is unreal but that is substantiated  by  the  understanding
that everything material is the effect of a cause which  is  not  perceived.
This is confirmed  in  Vedanta  Sutra  III.II.III  beginning  <i>mayamatram  tu</i>
<i>kartsyena</i> which states: Creation is only illusory because its nature is  not
manifest in its  entirety.  The  complete  cosmic  manifestation  and  total
material creation comprised of demigods,  humans,  demons,  animals,  birds,
fish, plants, etc. is created, maintained and sustained under  the  absolute
control of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Creation is His by  product,  pervaded,
supported and energised by Him  alone. Yet adamantly the demoniac  bray  and
howl that there is no Supreme  Lord,  no  supreme  god  or  supreme  creator
involved in the process and formation of creation. If they think like  this,
then how do  the  demoniac  say  that  creation  came  into  existence?  The
demoniac analysing existence from only  a  limited  materialistic  viewpoint
conclude that creation is evolving in all species  of  life  solely  through
the mutual copulation of male and female by sexual  intercourse.  Seeing  no
other external source they opine that lust alone must be the sole  cause  of
creation and determinedly continue degrading themselves  in  their  demoniac
activities.
