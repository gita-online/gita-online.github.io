In this world nothing is as purifying as spiritual knowledge.  Then  why  is
not everyone pursuing this?  Lord  Krishna  explains  that  first  one  must
become qualified from prolonged practice of <i>karma yoga</i> or  prescribed  Vedic
activities performed without desire for rewards. Then in due course of  time
if there is no interruption knowledge will arise leading to purity of  heart
after which <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation will be achieved.
