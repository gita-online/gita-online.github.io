What Lord Krishna states in this verse  concerning  the  cyclic  coming  and
going of all beings is clear; but He must be either  an  instrumental  cause
or a material cause of all  beings  and  how  can  this  be?  If  He  is  an
instrumental cause then  He  cannot  be  designated  as  the  substratum  of
everything in existence like  a  potter  making  pots.  Yet  if  He  is  the
material cause being the substratum of all existence is impossible  as  well
because merging oneself into  all  the  forms  of  material  nature  creates
something which only can revert back to its original  condition  only  after
the destruction of that which was created. In this way it could  be  assumed
that all beings abiding within the Supreme Lord  will  merge  with  Him  and
again will be created after He transforms Himself and that  would  mean  the
Supreme Lord is subject to modification and attachment.  To  ward  off  this
misunderstanding Lord Krishna states all beings movable  and  immovable  are
subject to <i>prakritam yanti mamakam</i> meaning all beings leave their forms  and
enter into the material substratum which  is  under  His  complete  control.
This happens during the final dissolution at the end of  a  life  of  Brahma
and at the dawn of the next creation the Supreme Lord manifests  them  again
into forms. Thus all beings are produced  in  and  from  <i>prakriti</i>  which  is
manifested by the potency of the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence which emanates directly from the Supreme Lord. They  dwell  in
it and are manifested and unmanifested by it. So  in  this  way  all  beings
eside in Him. The power and the powerful can never be  divided  or  function
separately. To exemplify the inseparable nature of the two,  the  power  and
the powerful manifestation is expressed jointly as the powerful.
<p>
So the reality is the Supreme Lord is  the  material  cause  of  all  living
entities by His potency of <i>prakriti</i> which does it for Him without  His  ever
being  subject  to  any  modification  or  attachment.  He   is   also   the
instrumental cause as well because He is the creator of all creators. So  it
is clear that the Supreme Lord is the cause of  all  causes  which  includes
both the material cause and the instrumental cause. The material  substratum
known also as primordial matter is insentient and hence cannot be  separated
by material nature because the modification  and  transformations  into  its
subdivisions of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of goodness, passion and  ignorance
fully depend upon it for their activity but through all  the  processes  the
potency  of  the  Supreme  Lord  is  influencing  all  to  act  in  the  way
prescribed.
<p>
Therefore there is no contradiction and it can be  clearly  understood  that
the Supreme  Lord  through  His  spiritual  potency  known  as  the  <i>brahman</i>
which manifests <i>prakriti</i> which is the material cause of all existence  where
unlimited myriad of diverse and variegated forms are seen to  manifest.  Yet
although the Supreme Lord is the ultimate  source  of  all  beings  He  ever
remains  unattached  and  untainted  by  the  qualities  and  attributes  of
insentient material nature both corporeal and subtle. This  is  because  the
Supreme Lord  is  the  sovereign  ruler  of  all  including  His  phenomenal
spiritual potencies  which  are  beyond  the  realm  of  human  thought  and
intellect.
