In answer to the question, Who is qualified  for  this  yoga  which  bestows
such a great reward? Lord Krishna states  the  word  yah  vihaya  whomsoever
giving up. The use of the pronoun yah meaning  who  whosoever  denotes  that
there  are  no   restrictions   regarding   class,   caste,   education   or
qualification for engaging in this process of self-realisation  preceded  by
abandoning attachment to all sense objects.  Abandoning  fully  all  desires
for things to obtain, desires present and desires approaching,  experiencing
those things only which come on their own accord. Free from  attachment  and
hence free from egoism, devoid of feeling my-ness  such  as  this  is  mine,
when acquiring food, clothing,  etc.  and  free  from  even  the  thirst  of
enjoyment. Being free as well from the feeling of I-ness  towards  the  body
and senses thinking that I am the physical body syndrome. Due  to  the  firm
knowledge about the eternal soul being  distinctly  different  from  all  of
these material designations,  wherever  and  whatever  such  a  one  engages
themselves they are always situated in a state of perfect peace.
