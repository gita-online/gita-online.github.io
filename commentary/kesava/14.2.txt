Elaborating further Lord Krishna explains that those  who  devoutly  embrace
this wisdom gain spiritual intelligence and  their  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul
exalts in communion with Him, revealing its quality of eternality like  Him.
No longer are they forced to except incarceration in a mothers womb even  at
the time of universal creation when Brahma  and  others  are  born.  Neither
will such a one ever experience the pangs of  death  even  at  the  time  of
universal dissolution when all is recycled because  they  have  ascended  to
the spiritual worlds.
