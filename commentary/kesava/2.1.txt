Having heard Arjuna's justifications from refraining from the battle due  to
the fear of receiving sin for the slaying of  relatives;  Dhritarastra   was
relieved of the fear that his sons  might  have  returned  to  the  Pandavas
their fair share of the kingdom and desired  to  know  what  happened  next.
Sanjaya spoke that Arjunas eyes were brimming with  tears,  when  ones  eyes
are full of tears ones  clear  vision  is  obstructed  and  thus  refers  to
Arjunas  unable  to  see  the  situation  in  the  correct  perspective.  By
addressing Lord Krishna with the vocative Madhusudana  indicates  that  just
as He destroyed the demon Madhu in times  of  yore,  by  descending  in  the
royal dynasty as a ksatriya He would  destroy  all  the  demoniac  and  evil
elements which are burdening the Earth.
