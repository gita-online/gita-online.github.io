Having clarified the reality that all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  entering
into material existence is caused by the combination of spirit  and  matter.
Now Lord Krishna confirms that one who sees the Supreme  Lord  as  <i>paramatma</i>
the  Supreme  Soul  situated  equally  <i>sarvesu  bhutesu</i>  within  all  living
entities within all species of life and who can perceive  the  Supreme  Lord
existing  through  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum   pervading   all
existence, also in perishable matter. Such a  person  is  one  who  actually
perceives reality.
