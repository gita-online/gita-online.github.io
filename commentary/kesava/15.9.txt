Those who are ignorant and unevolved are not able  to  discriminate  between
the <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  and  the  physical  body.  Hence  lacking  the
spiritual intelligence they are completely oblivious  of  the  reality  that
the <i>atma</i> is distinctly different from the body and the  senses  even  though
it is experiencing the  senses  when  dwelling  within  the  body,  or  when
transmigrating from the body or when entering a new body as  human,  demigod
or animal due to the influence of the  <i>gunas</i>  or  three  modes  of  material
nature and the resultant tribulation of <i>karma</i> or reactions to  actions.  But
those with spiritual intelligence, possessing the  eye  of  wisdom  acquired
through devotion and knowledge of the Vedic  scriptures  as  taught  by  the
Vaisnava spiritual preceptor will naturally realise both  the  eternal  <i>atma</i>
and the transcendental  Supreme  Lord  in  reality  as  having  no  material
qualities in any respect.
