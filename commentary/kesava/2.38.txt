Now Lord Krishna  refutes  Arjuna  previous  worry  about  accruing  sin  by
killing  his  heinous  enemies  with  the  words  sukha  and  dukha  meaning
happiness and unhappiness. Although the pleasure of happiness and  the  pain
of unhappiness in fighting this righteous war  are  inevitable;  still  this
must be considered as pertaining to the body only and not to the soul  which
is distinctly different from the physical body.  Profit  and  gain,  victory
and defeat even  without  considering  the  goal  of  heaven  Arjuna  should
prepare to fight for the sole purpose of exclusively  fulfilling  his  duty.
Thus fixed in this determination  with  proper  understanding  if  he  slays
anyone he will not incur sin. To the contrary Arjuna will be free  from  the
sin incurred by refraining from the battle and not executing his duty.
