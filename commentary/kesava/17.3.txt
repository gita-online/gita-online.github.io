The faith of everyone is dependent  upon  and  molded  to  their  individual
mental constitution. The quality of faith  is  determined  by  one's  mental
disposition which is the intellectual characteristics or  lack  of  and  the
impressions that the mind  is  imbued  with,  which  is  the  impetus  which
propels one into one of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature.
Although by nature intellect is essentially  of  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of
goodness yet because intellect is a product of the  ego  it  still  promotes
desires and  attractions which are threefold even as are the types  of  food
and drinks one finds appealing. All this is due to <i>samskaras</i> or  impressions
from past lives where such activities were engaged  in  habitually.  At  the
very moment of birth itself, one is born  with  a  preponderance  of  either
<i>sattva guna</i> with attraction to the divine  energy,  <i>raja  guna</i>  or  mode  of
passion with attraction to demoniac  entities  and  <i>tama  guna</i>  or  mode  of
ignorance with an attraction to ghosts and spirits. In  the  human  race  it
can be seen  that  the  intellect  is  mixed  but  still  there  will  be  a
preponderance for one of the three  <i>gunas.</i>  But  because  the  intellect  of
everyone is situated only in the quality  of  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  element  of
faith itself is characterised by goodness. But one who is situated  in  <i>raja</i>
<i>guna</i> has faith but in passion and hence deluded,  one  who  is  situated  in
<i>tama guna</i> has faith but in ignorance and thus perverted. Whereas one who  is
situated in <i>sattva guna</i> has faith that is in goodness which is  the  natural
state of the intellect and  thus  they  are  not  subject  to  delusion  and
perversion. The <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings revolving in <i>samsara</i> the  perpetual
cycle of birth and death have not qualified for  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material existence; yet they are all constituted of faith and  whatever  the
nature of their faith indeed that is what  they  verily  are.  In  the  word
<i>sraddhamaya</i>   the   suffix   <i>maya</i>   meaning   constitutes,   expresses   the
preponderance towards one of the three types  of  faith.  The  qualities  of
<i>sattva guna, raja guna</i> and <i>tama guna</i> are discerned by the activities that  a
<i>jiva</i> engages themselves in. Those established in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  advance  and
evolve spiritually. Those who are rooted in <i>raja guna</i> stay  where  they  are
unable to advance and evolve and those who are enveloped in <i>tama  guna</i>  sink
deeper into lower species and existences.
