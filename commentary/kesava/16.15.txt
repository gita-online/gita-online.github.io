The demoniac are hurled  into  lower  and  lower  degraded  wombs  that  are
receptacles for  vile,  despicable,  diabolical  activities  and  abominable
conduct. The demoniac are also overtly antagonistic to  the  ordinances  and
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures which constitute the absolute truth  and
are the directives of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  for  the  benefit  of  all
creation. The born of the  demoniac  nature  are  devoid  of  any  spiritual
discrimination whatsoever.  Locked  in  ignorance  and  nescience  they  are
continuously  unable  to  have  the  slightest  spiritual  impulse  to  even
approach the devotees of Lord Krishna  and  learn  from  them  submissively.
Hence without the devotees mercy it is not possible to approach the  Supreme
Lord and thus the demoniac are forever barred  from  attaining  the  Supreme
Lord who is the ultimate bestower of all results. Without the mercy of  Lord
Krishna's devotees it is not possible to  get  the  spiritual  understanding
necessary to enable one to approach the  Supreme  Lord.  Thus  the  demoniac
descend deeper and deeper into lower and  lower  species  of  degraded  life
such as reptiles, insects, worms and maggots.
