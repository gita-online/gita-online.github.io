What more needs to be said. The Supreme Lord Krishna is the  sole  cause  of
creation and all living entities. He iterates this with the words  <i>ye  caiva</i>
meaning and certainly all these others of the three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  being
those born in <i>sattvas</i> or goodness with  discrimination  and  sense  control,
those born in <i>rajas</i> or passion with pride  and  desire  and  those  born  in
<i>tamas</i> or ignorance with inertia and delusion. The  original  source  of  all
living entities is exclusively Lord Krishna but their birth in  any  of  the
three <i>gunas</i> is caused  exclusively  by  their  own  actions  and  subsequent
reactions since time immemorial. If one is to say that the reactions may  be
the Supreme Lords also because He is the original, it  is  refuted  by  this
verse stating that although they emanate from Him, He is not dependent  upon
the living entities as in the case of the <i>atma</i>  or  soul  is  for  residence
because all living entities abide in Him and are dependent upon Him.
<p>
The particle <i>tu</i> meaning however  suggests  another  interpretation  of  this
verse which may be explained as the demi-gods evolve  from  the  quality  of
<i>sattvas,</i> humans evolve from the quality of <i>rajas</i>  and  animals  evolve  from
the quality of <i>tamas.</i> All have evolved from  Lord  Krishna  but  He  is  not
dependent upon them. At times He incarnates in  the  material  creation  for
the purpose of maintaining universal order or to enjoy His <i>lilas</i>  or  divine
pastimes but to do so He does  not  have  to  give  up  His  transcendental,
spiritual form for a material body as His attributes, powers  and  qualities
all remain intact. All creation comprised of animate  and  inanimate  beings
emanates solely from Him is sustained  by  Him  and  likewise  is  dissolved
again back into Him. In the  relationship  between  cause  and  effect   the
Supreme Lord is always superior due exclusively to His personal  potency  of
powers, qualities and attributes with no other support. This is  because  He
alone is the cause and the source,  the  maintainer  and  sustainer  of  the
entire creation and is completely independent.
