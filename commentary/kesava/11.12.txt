Now Arjuna bequeathed with divine vision sees in  Lord  Krishna's  <i>visvarupa</i>
or divine universal form all the things He had previously described  as  His
<i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental opulence. The words <i>jagat krtsnam</i>  meaning
the whole creation confirms that in  the  incomparable  <i>visvarupa</i>  could  be
seen  all  things  animate  and  inanimate  moving  and   stationary   which
constituted the denizens from all the planetary  systems  from  the  highest
Bhur to the lowest Patala with all their various  inhabitants  of  demigods,
human, animal and demon, all concentrated with a  singular  location  within
the universal form.
