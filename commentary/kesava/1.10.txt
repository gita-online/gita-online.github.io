So it may also be put forth that  if  Duryodhana  is  so  convinced  of  his
superiority then why does he need to assure himself. In this verse  although
he states his army is unlimited by its tone it implies  by  his  reply  that
the army of his with all the mighty heroes previously  mentioned   protected
by Bhishma seems inadequate, whereas the  army  of  the  Pandavas  which  is
protected by Bhima seems adequate to him.
