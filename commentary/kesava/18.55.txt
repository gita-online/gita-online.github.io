Lord Krishna gives the caution that one should  not  be  deluded  and  think
that they are in any way independent of the Supreme Lord. If  due  to  false
ego one thinks that they are the independent doer of their actions and  take
the decision to go against their own  natural  propensity  it  would  be  in
vain. Lord Krishna's external energy is  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence. From <i>prakriti</i> arises the three <i>gunas</i> or  modes
of material nature which  adjusts  itself  automatically  to  the  <i>karma</i>  or
reactions to  actions  acquired  by  the  different  activities  a  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being performs in countless lifetimes. Changing to the  appropriate
<i>guna</i> based on such actions the guna itself will compel one to act  according
to its dictates and any opposition will be futile.
