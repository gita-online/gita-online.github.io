Lord Krishna commences with the  three-fold  divisions  of  foods  with  the
words <i>ayuh-sattva</i> meaning promoting longevity. Food that promotes  spiritual
knowledge which  is  the  quality  of  intelligence  has  been  corroborated
previously in chapter XIV.XVII stating that: Wisdom  verily  arises  out  of
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode  of  goodness.  Whereas  greed  and  lust  are  the  by
products of <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion  and  lethargy  and  nescience  is
produced by those in <i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance. The word <i>bala</i>  meaning
strength and refers to food that gives the  power  to  perform  one's  duty.
Foods that are pleasant to eat, that bestow mental  tranquillity,  that  are
sustaining and easily digestible, that  are  nourishing  and  their  essence
remains invigorating the body even after digested are the  foods  which  are
dear to those endowed with the qualities of <i>sattva guna.</i> 
<p>
Foods which are extremely acidic, salty, spicy, pungent and bitter  such  as
<i>azadirachta indica</i> or burning such as chillies which burn the mouth,  throat
and stomach simply bring about distress and misery which leads  to  sickness
and disease. The prefix <i>aty</i>  meaning  extremely  at  the  end  of  the  word
<i>lavanaty</i> meaning extremely bitter applies to  all  the  descriptions  up  to
<i>vidadhinah</i> which means burning. Such foods are dear to  those  characterised
with <i>raja guna</i>.
<p>
Foods  which  are  half  cooked,  insipid,  stale,   tasteless,   polluting,
contaminated or leftovers from someone  and  foods  that  are  forbidden  to
offer to the Supreme Lord such as meat, fish, fowl,  eggs,  onions,  garlic,
mushrooms, wine, alcohol, etc. are the foods of choice  for  those  situated
in <i>tama guna.</i>
<p>
The obvious conclusion is that  those  who  are  spiritually  motivated  and
desire their best self interests  should  conscientiously  avoid  all  foods
characterised by <i>raja guna</i> and <i>tama guna</i> and  resort  exclusively  to  foods
that are of <i>sattva guna.</i>
