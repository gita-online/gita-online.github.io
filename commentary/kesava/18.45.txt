Because the  natural  propensity  inherent  within  is  always  accurate  it
behoves one to perform prescribed Vedic activites unto the Supreme  Lord  as
this leads to the highest perfection. Such activities  should  be  performed
consistently for securing  one's  own  best  interests.  This  Lord  Krishna
alludes to with the <i>sreyan</i> meaning better for it is better to perform  one's
own duty with the intention to propitiate the Supreme Lord  even  if  devoid
of merit or deficient in some way; it is still superior  to  performing  the
duties of another even if done exemplary.  The  performance  of  duties  not
sanctioned for one in the Vedic scriptures is risky and fraught with  danger
is susceptible  to  sin;  but  in  the  performance  of  one's  own  natural
prescribed duty no sin is incurred.
