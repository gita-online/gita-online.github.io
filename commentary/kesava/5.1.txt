Lord Krishna previously presented <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic  activities
without desire of rewards as a pre-eminent discipline but then  stated  that
one in <i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of  Vedic  knowledge  has  no  need  to
perform any action and then again He declared that the person  who  immersed
in the <i>atma</i> or soul has no need to perform <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  <i>jnana  yoga.</i>  In
this situation it is difficult for an aspirant of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  to
determine if <i>karma yoga</i> or <i>jnana yoga</i> is more appropriate or is it  possible
to simultaneously perform both together. Lord Krishna had  stated  that  one
who performs actions as a matter  of  duty  unattached  without  desire  for
rewards incurs no sinful reactions. Then again He had instructed that  <i>yagna</i>
or offerings of worship with spiritual intelligence is  superior  to  <i>yagnas</i>
performed  with  material  ingredients  because  all  actions  culminate  in
knowledge. So because the paths appear  conflicting  and  contrary  to  each
other Lord Krishna is being requested to resolve the issue definitively.
