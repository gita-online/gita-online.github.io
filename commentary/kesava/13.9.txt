The source of the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence
is the Supreme Lord known as <i>Parabrahma,</i> who  perceives  all  sense  objects
and activities of the senses  such as perception  of  sound,  sight,  smell,
the perception of speech etc. of the  external  organs.  Also  He  perceives
thinking, reflecting, determining of the internal organs such  as  the  mind
and intellect and omniscience  of  the  intuition.  Although  to  experience
these things in a material body a being requires the  physical  organs  such
as ears for sound, eyes for sight, nose for smell, etc. it is not  the  case
for the Supreme Lord who is <i>nirgunam</i> or devoid of  all  material  qualities;
yet at the same time  being  the  sustainer  and  nourisher  of  all  living
entities He  is  <i>guna-bhoktr</i>  or  the  ultimate  enjoyer  of  all  spiritual
qualities through the auspices of the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  within  all
sentient, living beings.
