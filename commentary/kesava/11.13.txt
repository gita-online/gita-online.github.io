What happened after seeing Lord  Krishna's  <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine  universal
form is now being  explained.  After  beholding  this  amazing  form  Arjuna
overcome  with  wonder  is  astonished  by  the  sight  of  this   supremely
transcendental and  omnipotent  reality.  With  hairs  standing  on  end  he
prostrated himself upon the ground with hands humbly joined together.
