After elaborating on Srimad Bhagavd-Gita as the essence  of  all  the  Vedic
scriptures Lord Krishna speaks of the particulars of  who  is  qualified  to
receive this most sacred science. It should never be imparted to one who  is
not a devotee, who is without control of mind, body, speech and  senses,  to
one who  disregards  their  own  natural  duties  according  to  status  and
qualification, to one who has no reverence for the spiritual  preceptor  and
to the Supreme Lord  even  if  practicing  austerities.  Who  is  averse  to
serving the spiritual master and  the  devotees  of  the  Supreme  Lord  and
never, ever to one who is envious and blasphemous of Lord Krishna.
<p>
By the rule of parallel opposites the understanding is that Srimad Bhagavad-
Gita may be instructed by a devotee to one who  practices  austerities,  who
is devoted to the spiritual preceptor, who is willing to serve the  devotees
and who  wholeheartedly  loves  Lord  Krishna  without  finding  fault  with
anybody.
