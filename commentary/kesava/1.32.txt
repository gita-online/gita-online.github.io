Some may ponder just what sin is Arjuna describing and this is now  revealed
in this verse. In a dynasty it is the father that is the foundation  of  the
family. He insures that the tradition of the members is maintained  as  well
being the support of all the members. In times of war it is the  father  who
goes to fight and sometimes the older  sons  who  are  the  fathers  of  the
future also go to war. If they are slain in battle  it  is  understood  that
the family is effectively destroyed and righteousness along  with  the  age-
old family customs and Vedic  traditions  eventually  cease  to  exist.  The
women and children not being properly protected, having   lost  the  shelter
of the father are thus overcome by  the  realities  of  basic  survival  and
become victims of unrighteousness.
