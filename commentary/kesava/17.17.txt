Lord Krishna describes the threefold divisions of <i>danam</i> or  charity.  It  is
an act of duty to give <i>danam</i> accordingly  to  one's  capability.  The  <i>danam</i>
that is offered freely from the heart to Vaisnavas  and   brahmanas  without
expectation of receiving anything back in return,  that  is  bestowed  in  a
holy place like Navadwip Dham or Jagannatha Puri, that is bequeathed  at  an
auspicious time such as the month of Kartika or the month of Magha is  <i>danam</i>
situated in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
