In order to delineate the characteristics and types  of  bondage  associated
collectively and individually to  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material
nature. Lord Krishna begins in three verses first with <i>sattva</i>  the  mode  of
goodness and  in  the  next  two  verses  <i>rajas</i>  or  passion  and  <i>tamas</i>  or
ignorance. The quality of <i>sattva</i> is  immaculate  ,  it  illuminates  and  is
lucid like a crystal. It is devoid  of  the  propensity  to  veil  or  cover
happiness  or  knowledge  and  it  possesses  tranquillity  and   equipoise.
Although <i>sattva</i> is imbued with such good qualities it still binds  the  <i>jiva</i>
or embodied being through attachment to happiness and knowledge which  keeps
the identification with the physical body  strong  inducing  feelings  of  I
feel happiness, I am knowledgeable and so  on.  This  entices  one  to  seek
accomplishments of  greater and greater deeds and experience the rewards  of
their result .
