After previously describing that a person who has conquered  their  mind  is
there own best friend and after explaining the special  qualities  possessed
by one who has climbed the heights and  is  detached  from  sense  impulses.
Lord Krishna now refers to the person who  has  traversed  successfully  the
path of <i>yoga</i> or  the  science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion with the ultimate consciousness and has become firmly  established
in their spiritual nature. Such a person has transcended all dualities  such
as cold and  heat,  happiness  and  distress,  honour  and  dishonour.  Such
persons  are  serene  and  peaceful  in  all  situations  because  they  are
established in spiritual knowledge from the Vedic scriptures
