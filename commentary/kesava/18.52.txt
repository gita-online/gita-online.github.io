Thus the results of communion with the Supreme  Lord  have  been  elaborated
upon  by  Lord  Krishna.  This  is  established   through   perfecting   the
performance of prescribed Vedic activities  as  a  natural  duty  selflessly
without any egoistic conceptions or any desire for rewards. Now  He  reveals
that the results for those who are performing  prescribed  Vedic  activities
in this way taking sole refuge in the Supreme Lord Krishna as the only  goal
to be attained and only reward to be sought after even  while  embroiled  in
worldly associations and mundane activities will still by His  Grace  attain
immutable, imperishable, eternal communion with Him.
