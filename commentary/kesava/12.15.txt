One who is impartial to friend and foe alike, free  from  the  influence  of
passion and hatred as well as honour and disgrace, who  remain  balanced  in
heat and cold, pleasure and pain and is free  from  attachment  to  anything
not supportive of <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna, who is given to silence being  of  controlled  speech,  is  content
with whatever comes along unsought by its own accord without  attachment  to
a fixed  residence,  of  sober  and  stable  mind  and  determinate  in  the
teachings of the Vedic scriptures, such a devotee of Lord  Krishna  is  very
dear to Him.
