Here Lord Krishna refers to others less qualified with  the  words  <i>anye  tu</i>
meaning yet others who have not listened to the spiritual master,  who  have
not meditated, who have not discriminated between matter and spirit and  who
are attached to the rewards of their labours. If they hear the Vedic  truths
with  humility  from  those  who  hearing  from  the  spiritual  master  are
practicing them and  adhere  to  following  these  methods  faithfully  with
conviction, eventually they will become firmly established in them  as  well
and their minds becoming pure, they too will certainly surpass <i>samsara,</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death. The word <i>api</i> meaning also  denotes  that
such accomplished persons undoubtedly will achieve this goal  in  this  very
life.
