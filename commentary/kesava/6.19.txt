In verse eighteen Lord Krishna already explained  that  fixed  concentration
in the <i>atma</i> or soul frees one from the  craving  of  sense  enjoyments.  Now
reflecting that these enjoyments are  the  primary  oppressors  against  the
practice of <i>yoga</i> or the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion with  the  ultimate  consciousness,  and  are  very  difficult  to
eradicate due to latent  impressions  from  past  activities;  Lord  Krishna
gives advice how to abandon them with the words  <i>sankalpa-prabhavan</i>  meaning
desires of the world. The word <i>sankalpa</i> is the  conceived  images  of  one's
desires. In the minds of the ignorant they are the forms of worldly  objects
yearned for. They also include the latent desires in  the  memory  from  the
remembrance of past experiences of sensual pleasures and enjoyments  in  the
thinking of: I enjoyed that and I  want  to  enjoy  this.  These  ideas  and
mentality are detrimental obstructions in the furtherance of  <i>yoga</i>  and  are
veritably the root cause of misery and suffering. One  should  reflect  that
they arise from the interactions of the sense objects in material  existence
and contemplating their banal and mundane nature develop a healthy  aversion
to engaging the body and the mind in their sense desires.
