In the seventh and eighth chapters Lord Krishna described:
1) The paramount position of the Supreme Lord.
2) The various types of devotees of the Supreme Lord.
<i>3) Bhakti</i> or pure loving devotion as the only  way  to  attain  the  Supreme
Lord.
4) That <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation is a prerequisite for attaining  the
Supreme Lord.
5) Only the devotees who have achieved the above attain liberation  and  the
Supreme Lord.
6) Those who lack sufficient  knowledge  and  soul  realisation  are  reborn
again and again.

In this chapter  Lord  Krishna  begins  revealing  confidential  information
about the Supreme Lord as well as the glory and extraordinary power  of  the
devotees. Now in order to express the greatness of spiritual  knowledge  and
to censure those in ignorance with little or no faith in Him;  Lord  Krishna
uses the word <i>anasuyave</i> meaning to those without envy and duplicity He  will
reveal  this  <i>guhyatamam</i>  or   confidential   knowledge.   The   wisdom   of
righteousness by which the <i>atma</i> or  soul  is  known  as  distinct  from  the
physical body which is even more confidential and the most  confidential  of
all is knowledge  about  the  Supreme  Lord  because  such  wisdom  is  only
attained solely by pure, loving devotion which gives  direct  perception  of
the Supreme Lord in reality. Once this wisdom  is  incorporated  into  one's
everyday life experience, wisdom of the Supreme Lord, His method of  worship
and the daily regulated practice that follows such  wisdom  frees  one  from
the dross and impurities o material existence and removes all the  obstacles
and things antagonistic to attaining the Supreme Lord Krishna.
