One can recognise the presence of the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material
nature by their productive effects. Lord Krishna states that when the  gates
of the physical body which are the senses such as the eyes  and  ears,  etc.
by which one perceives light and sound achieve a  sense  of  dispassion  and
discerment then arise s the light of true perception and it symbolises  that
<i>sattva guna</i> or the mode of goodness is predominant based on its  feeling  of
well being and happiness.
