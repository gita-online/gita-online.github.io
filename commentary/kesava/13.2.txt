Here the Supreme Lord Krishna explains the discrimination  between  the  two
knowers of the physical manifestation which is  known  as  the  field  where
activities are performed and the knowers of the  field,  one  being  Himself
and the other being <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul within  all  living  entities
which contains each and every  individual  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal  soul.  It  was
already explained in chapter eleven, verse fifteen that the  total  creation
with all its myriad hosts of being was within Lord Krishna's  transcendental
universal form; but a separate discourse on the  knowers  of  the  field  of
activity was not given at  that  time.  Now  Lord  Krishna  delineates  this
important understanding comprehensively. Previously in chapter seven,  verse
six Lord Krishna revealed that He is the origin of the entire  creation  and
the cause of its dissolution as well. In chapter  seven,  verse  seven  Lord
Krishna reveals that nothing is Superior  to  Him  and  that  everything  in
existence is connected to Him as pearls are on a thread.  In  chapter  nine,
verse four Lord Krishna reveals that He pervades the  entire  creation  with
all living entities residing within Him.  In  chapter  eleven,  verse  seven
Lord Krishna reveals that the entire manifest creation with all  its  moving
and non-moving beings is residing in just one portion of His  transcendental
universal form. Lord Krishna explains how it is impossible for  creation  to
sustain itself and function without Him as His potency of <i>brahman</i>  which  is
the spiritual substratum pervading all existence. Yet He also spoke  of  His
inconceivable power as being in completely separate from the creation  whose
beings are not within Him in chapter nine, verse five and later  in  chapter
nine, verse ten Lord Krishna explains that by  His  direction  His  external
energy <i>prakriti</i> or the  material  substratum  pervading  physical  existence
automatically manifests the entire creation perpetually.
<p>
Previously in chapter twelve,  verse  six  Lord  Krishna  declared  that  He
quickly rescues from <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of birth and death,  all
His loving devotees who exclusively strive  to  attain  Him  alone.  It  was
explained that the knower of the field is the individual <i>atma</i>  which  is  of
an eternal nature and is the  essential  part  of  every  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied
being. It should not be imagined that the <i>atma</i> is separate from the  Supreme
Lord in any way. That is why in this verse Lord  Krishna  confirms  that  He
alone is the omniscient and omnipresent consciousness  within  the  <i>atma</i>  of
all living entities such as demigods, humans, flora, fauna and so on of  all
<i>jivas;</i> yet He is completely different and separate  from  all  of  them.  To
further corroborate this we  find  in  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.VIII.VII
beginning: <i>aitad  atmayam  idam  sarvam</i>  meaning:  This  whole  creation  is
ensouled by Him. That is  reality.  That  is  the  <i>atma.</i>  In  the  Mandukhya
Upanisad II we find: Verily the  <i>atma</i>  is  the  <i>brahman.</i>  In  the  Chandogya
Upanisad III.XIV.XI we see: As the whole creation is verily the <i>brahman</i>  one
should tranquilly worship it as the place one manifested from  and  as  that
which one is breathing and also as  the place  where  one  will  return  to.
Similarly  although  all  are  various  manifestations  of  Lord   Krishna's
variegated <i>avatars</i> or incarnations, in Vedic scriptures He is  categorically
declared to be separate and  different  from  all  of  them.  In  the  Katha
Upanisad I1.II.X and IX it states: As the one wind  has  entered  into  this
world and becomes correspondingly within the form  of  every  form,  so  the
<i>atma</i> or eternal soul of all living beings  is  correspondingly  within  each
and every form and yet is transcendental to it. As the sun which is the  eye
of the world is never compromised by the  external  imperfections  of  one's
eyes, in the same way the <i>atma</i> is never compromised by  the  evil  that  may
exist in the world being always transcendental to it.
<p>
The omnipotent, omniscient, all pervading and eternal Supreme  Lord  Krishna
is now revealing the ultimate reality and truth: That true knowledge of  Him
as the complete cause and sole source of all creation is  knowledge  of  the
<i>ksetra</i> or field which is material existence and knowledge of the  knower  of
the field being <i>paramatma</i> or  the  Supreme  Lord  in  His  localised  aspect
within the heart of all living entities. Any idea or conception contrary  to
this reality is illusion and ignorance.
<p>
There are those not being in authorised disciplic succession  who  speculate
that <i>ksetrajnam capi mam viddhi</i> means that the Supreme  Lord  suggests  that
due to contact to  His  adjunct  of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence, He, Himself invariably becomes finite  as  the
individual transmigrating <i>atma</i> or soul from body to  body  at  the  time  of
death until it becomes free from nescience. But this hypothesis  is  totally
false  because  it  is  contradictory  to  the  conclusion  of   the   Vedic
scriptures. The particle <i>api</i> meaning also in this  verse  denotes  that  the
Supreme Lord is totally differentiated in nature from  both  the  <i>ksetrajnam</i>
and the <i>ksetra</i> and it is not possible to prove  that  the  identity  of  the
<i>atma</i> is synonymous with <i>paramatma</i> based on such statements as He is the  the
constant among the inconstant,  the  intelligent  among  the  unintelligent.
Some examples of this are given as follows  in  the  Vedic  scriptures:  The
Katha  Upanisad  II.II.XIII  states:  There  are  two   unborn   ones,   the
knowledgeable and the unknowledgeable, the omnipotent and the impotent.  The
Svetasvatara Upanisad I.IX states: Two birds inextricably  connected  reside
on the same tree, one eats of the sweet  fruit  while  the  other  looks  on
without eating. The Mundaka Upanisad III.I.I states: The ruler  of  <i>prakriti</i>
and the <i>atma</i> is the Supreme Lord. The Taittiriya Aranyaka III.XI.II  states:
That who is dwelling in  the  consciousness  and  yet   is  other  than  the
consciousness, whom the consciousness does not know, within whose  spiritual
body the consciousness resides is the  inner  controller  the  monitor,  the
eternal soul. The Brihadaranyaka Upanisad III:VII.XXII states: The cause  of
reincarnation  and  of  liberation,  of  freedom  and  bondage.  Again   the
Svetasvatara Upanisad VI.XVI states: The Supreme Lord  is  higher  than  the
highest imperishable. The controller of all and the ruler of all.  Only  the
omnipotent all pervading Supreme Lord  Krishna  should  be  propitiated  and
glorified for He alone is the source of everything and has entered into  the
hearts of all living beings as the eternal soul. The Vedanta  Sutras  I.I.II
confirms: On account of the declaration  of  distinction  between  <i>paramatma</i>
the Supreme soul and  <i>atma</i>  the  individual  soul.  The  Taittriya  Upanisad
II.VII states:  The  Supreme  soul  consisting  of  bliss  is  next  to  the
individual  soul.  Vedanta  Sutras  I.I.VII  again  states:  Contrarily  the
individual soul is not referred to here as the qualities  mentioned  are  no
appropriate for it. When mentioning the attainee it is  the  localised  <i>atma</i>
and the object of attainment  is  the  all-pervading  <i>brahman</i>  which  is  of
<i>paramatma</i>. Vedanta Sutras I.III.VIIL states: On  account  of  statements  in
the Vedic scriptures of distinction between the <i>brahman</i>  and  the  <i>atma</i>  the
former is something more than the latter. Vedanta Sutras  II.I.XXII  states:
Senses, mind,  intelligence,  prowess,  might,  forebearance,  the  physical
body, the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being and the <i>atma</i> are  all  constituted  by  the
Supreme Lord. In the Vishnu Sahasra Nama or 1000 names of Vishnu  verse  135
it states: The  entire  creation  comprised  of  demigods,  humans,  demons,
Gandharvas, Yaksas, Raksasas, etc. are all  under  control  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna.
<p>
Lord  Krishna  declared  in  XII.V:  That  He   has   a   superior   eternal
manifestation as well as a inferior temporary  manifestation.  His  internal
potency is eternal and superior to  the  external  temporary  manifestation.
The soul is considered a marginal potency of the Supreme Lord because it  is
eternal and as transmigration from body to body is continuously  transpiring
incessantly and all species of life on Earth are gradually  evolving  up  to
the human species endowed with free will. Thus the fundamental questions  of
existence  and  the  purpose  and  goal  of  life   can   be   contemplated,
comprehended and assimilated. There are two types  of  beings  in  creation.
The perishable and the imperishable. All the innumerable bodies of <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied  being  are  perishable  but  the  <i>atma</i>  within  being  eternal  is
imperishable. The sentient  is  the  higher  potency  of  the  Supreme  Lord
whereas the insentient is the lesser  potency.  Each  and  every  individual
<i>atma</i> although being eternal  are  all  part  and  parcel  of  <i>paramatma</i>  the
Supreme Soul which  inconceivably  comprises  the  transcendental  spiritual
body of the Supreme Lord  Krishna.  Other  than  their  eternal  nature  and
unfathomable relationship to the Supreme Lord; no other  characteristic  can
be given regarding there bondage or liberation. The <i>atma</i> is  of  the  higher
potency and possesses only spiritual qualities with  no  material  qualities
whatsoever and thus being attributeless is never  contaminated  by  material
actions or influenced  by  their  reactions;  like  the  sun  which  remains
pristine and pure whether shining on a soiled or  clean  space.  The  subtle
and physical bodies are of the lesser potency and are connected  to  bondage
and liberation being thus subjected to material  nature  and  its  reactions
the subtle body is forced to accept <i>samsara</i> the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth
and death incessantly. The <i>atma</i> is the  witness  monitoring  an  individuals
thoughts and actions  and  <i>paramatma</i>  is  the  witness  monitoring  all  the
individual   <i>atmas</i>   within   each   and   every   sentient   living   being
simultaneously; but it is imperceptible to the mind and senses.
<p>
Such being the position of the individual <i>atma</i> and <i>paramatma</i> of the  Supreme
Lord even if the difference is imperceptible due to both  being  beyond  the
purview of the mind and senses it  can  be  logically  understood  that  the
difference is actual and eternal. For no <i>jiva</i> or embodied being can  in  any
way possess the divine  qualities  and  attributes  declared  in  the  Vedic
scriptures such as:  omnipotence,  omniscience,  omnipresence,  sovereignty,
eternality, origin of all, controller of all, etc. Any contrary  supposition
to this difference can only be based upon the machinations of  the  mind  or
impressions of the senses based on contact  with  sense  objects  which  are
both illusory. The  individual  <i>atma</i>  is  eternal  and  localised  within  a
singular being and is the same qualitatively but not  quantitatively  as  it
is infinitesimal compared to <i>paramatma</i> who is unlimited and is comprised  of
and embodies all <i>atmas</i>  within  each  and  every  living  entity  throughout
creation. It should never be  put  forth  that  the  Supreme  Lord  has  any
limitations whatsoever for this hypothesis is false. It  should  also  never
be supposed that the Supreme Lord has any adjuncts  connected  to  Him  like
voidness or  nescience  or  absence  of  qualities.  The  Supreme  Lord  has
unlimited qualities but His qualities are all spiritual, none are  material.
The Supreme Lord has no connection to nescience as it is a material  quality
and the Supreme Lord possess no material qualities. Factual knowledge  about
the Supreme Lord Krishna is automatically the absence of nescience and  true
knowledge about Him is freedom from illusion.   How  can  the  Supreme  Lord
Himself not know the real nature of nescience? Since it has previously  been
established that the omniscient and omnipotent Supreme Lord  is  the  knower
of even more than everything  in  existence  then  how  could  He  ever  get
influenced by nescience which is the root cause  of  <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual
cycle of birth and death. Contrarily if He did not know the real  nature  of
nescience then He would not be absolute and could never be  identified  with
<i>paramatma</i>  and  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence. Another way to look at this is that  nescience  and  its  effects
fall into the sphere of false knowledge which  is  illusion  and  unable  to
ever contaminate the spiritual sanctity of the Supreme Lord. The water of  a
mirage may appear sparkling but by no influence in  the  sand  will  mud  be
created and in the same way the Supreme Lord who is the ultimate  knower  of
the field of activity is never influenced by  nescience.  If  nescience  was
benign and harmless to the living entities then there would be no  necessity
to remove it. Also the Vedic scriptures comparing nescience to  bondage  and
absence of nescience to liberation would prove meaningless.
<p>
The fact must be emphasised in no uncertain terms  that  there  is  not  the
slightest scope for contradiction of the Vedic  scriptures  and  what  would
appear to be contradictory is only a result  of  insufficient  knowledge  of
the Vedic scriptures learned systematically  in  the  proper  order  from  a
Vaisnava preceptor in one of  the  four  authorised  channels  of  disciplic
succession.  Statements such as the <i>brahman</i> being one without a  second  are
significant because they establish the unity of  <i>paramatma,</i>  the  <i>atma,</i>  and
the <i>brahman</i> as being eternal manifestations of the Supreme Lord.  This  also
includes everything sentient and  insentient  which  are  known  by  various
terms  like  spirit  and  matter,  the  eternal  and   the   temporal,   the
imperishable and the perishable, etc. Yet all are pervaded by and  dependent
upon the Supreme Lord in His aspect of the <i>brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence. When one has been properly educated in  the  proper
order into  the  profound  depths  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  one  has  the
indispensable foundation that allows them to  categorically  understand  the
various angles of vision the Vedic  scriptures  present  and  the  essential
understanding that comprehensively harmonises  them  all  with  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna or His authorised incarnations and expansions. Passages in  the
Vedic scriptures refer to His  supreme  position.  The  Taittiriya  Aranyaka
III.II.II states: The controller of all living  entities  has  entered  into
the hearts of all as the eternal soul.  The  Maha  Narayana  Upanisad  XI.VI
states: The Supreme Lord pervades all that is seen and heard throughout  all
creation. Lord Krishna confirms X.XX that He resides as the soul within  the
heart of all living  beings.   The  Vishnu  Sahasra  Nama  CXXXVI  beginning
<i>indriyani mano buddhih sattvam</i> states: The senses, the mind, the  intellect,
vitality, splendour, strength and courage all have  Lord  Krishna  as  their
soul, along with the body and the  knower  of  the  body.  In  the  dialogue
between the life breaths and the organs of the body found in  the  Chandogya
Upanisad V.I.XV it is stated: Verily the Supreme Lord is not referred to  as
eyes, or ears, or minds, etc. but He is referred to as the  life  breath  of
all  for  the  vital  breath  activates  all  the  others.   The   universal
understanding is that whatever object is dependent upon  its  existence  and
functioning upon something else it can  be  designated  by  that  somethings
name. Moreover the different names have propriety according to  the  primary
meanings of the terms and various respective forms and  manifestations  such
as the  great  variety  found  in  the  physical  manifestation  or  in  the
unlimited forms that embodied beings manifest  that  within  the  individual
soul resides.. Contrarily the synonymous names attributed to  <i>paramatma</i>  the
supreme soul and the Supreme Lord  have  propriety  with  the  highest  self
exclusively with no division, separation or independence from Him ever.  The
Brhadaranyaka Upanisad I.IV.II confirms: Everything for the Supreme Lord  is
different who all other forms constitute His Self because there  is  nothing
existing apart from Him. So the reality that there is not even  an  iota  of
contradiction between any statement  from  the  Vedic  scriptures  with  any
other statement  from  another  Vedic  scripture.  Hence  the  meanings  and
potencies regarding different names and synonymous names in no  way  sublate
each other.
<p>
Keeping this understanding in mind the author of the Vedas, Vedanta  Sutras,
Srimad  Bhagavatam  and  the  Puranas,   <i>lila  avatar</i>   Krishna   Dvaipayana
Vedavyasa has written in Vedanta Sutras II.III.XXXXIII: The soul is  a  part
of the Supreme Lord due to the  difference  between  the  two  and  also  by
similarness to the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence
which is the Supreme Lords manifestation.  In  Vedanta  Sutras  III.II.XXVII
and XXVIII is stated: The difference and non-difference of the Supreme  Lord
and the soul as revealed in Vedic sciptures is like the relation of the  sun
and its rays, also on account of both being luminous.  This  was  emphasised
for two reasons. One was  to  validate  the  main  theme  of  the  Upanisads
through the non-contradiction of Vedic statements  which  appear  to  differ
due to variegated designations concerning the  many  manifestations  of  the
one Supreme Lord Krishna. Two was to establish the causeless nature  of  the
sentient and insentient manifestations of the Supreme Lord  being  naturally
connected through the variable and invarible  relationship.  The  Taittiriya
Aranyaka III.XIV.I states: Although  the  Supreme  Lord  is  one  without  a
second,  He  manifests  in  unlimited  places.  Although  He  is   the   one
indivisible Supreme Being, He has entered into the physical  bodies  of  all
living entities.
<p>
Other Vedic scriptures iterate  the  same  such  as  in  Manu  Samhita:  The
<i>brahman</i> being absolute although one is diverse and although  diverse  it  is
one. Who can know it? In the Vishnu Purana it is stated  by  Prince  Prahlad
thus: Continuous  obeisance  to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  whom  without
nothing would exist; yet He Himself is totally different from all  creation.
Obeisance to the Supreme Lord the  <i>atma</i>  within  the  manifestation  of  the
sentient and the <i>brahman</i> within the manifestation  of  the  insentient.  The
sole  refuge  beyond  all  manifestations.  The  indivisible  one  and   the
unlimited innumerable. The prime cause of  Vasudeva,  Sankarsana,  Pradyumna
and Aniruddha in the Caturvyuha which manifests the three Purusa avatars  of
Vishnu. Obeisance to the Supreme Lord who is the greatest  of  the  greatest
and the subtlest of the  subtlest,  in  this  way  His  glorious  effulgence
manifests. From the Supreme Lord comes all of creation,  He  has  manifested
all that there is and yet He is not any element of it for He  is  completely
transcendental to all things material and beyond even the mundane  cause  of
creation. Ghantakarna states in  the  Harivamsa:  We  are  all  continuously
endeavouring and dedicating our lives to associate  with  the  Supreme  Lord
amongst whose devotees study the  Vedic  scriptures  and  logically  declare
that He is one without a second although unlimitedly variegated, unborn  and
primordial. In the Bhagavat Purana I.V.XX  Narada  speaks  to  his  disciple
Vyasa stating: The whole creation is pervaded by the  Supreme  Lord  and  He
alone is the source of its  origin,  sustenance  and  destruction.  Also  in
L.VII.II of the same purana is stated: There is nothing else other than  the
Supreme Lord in that which is existent  and  also  in  that  which  is  non-
existent.
<p>
So the devotees of the Supreme Lord and the followers of <i>sanatan  dharma</i>  or
eternal righteousness should follow  this  doctrine  of  natural  difference
from and non-difeerence  of  the  sentient  and  insentient  nature  of  the
<i>brahman, paramatma</i> and the  Supreme  Lord  which  is  harmonious    and  not
contradictory to any  statements  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  including  the
Vedanta Sutras, Puranas, Upanisads, Ramayana, Mahabharata etc. and is  fully
approved and sanctioned by Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasadeva the original  author
of the Vedas.  All  other  conceptions  that  deviate  and  complicate  this
fundamental understanding are to be known  as  erroneous  totally  based  on
illusion and should be pre-emptively rejected and  ignored.  Lord  Krishna's
<i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal  form  constituted  of  elements  like  earth,
fire, wind, water and ether is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord  Himself,
because it is He who is dwelling within these  elements  in  a  supra-subtle
form. The Brihadaranyaka  Upanisad  III.VII.III  states:  The  Supreme  Lord
dwelling in the earth and yet is other than earth, whom the aerth  does  not
know, whose body is the earth, who controls the earth  from  within  is  the
eternal  soul,  the  inner  controller.   Also   in   the   same   scripture
III.VII.XXIII is stated: The Supreme Lord is dwelling  with  the  individual
soul, yet is other than the individual soul, whom the individual soul  knows
not, whose body comprises all souls, who controls the soul from  within.  He
is <i>paramatma</i> the immortal all pervading Supreme soul.
<p>
Vedic scriptural statements like the Chandogya Upanisad VI.III.II  where  it
states: I shall enter these three  divinities  with  the  eternal  soul  not
separated from name and form and in the Taittriya Upanisad  II.VI  where  it
states: Having manifested creation the Supreme  Lord  entered  into  it  and
having entered into it, He became both the sentient and the insentient,  the
conscious and the unconscious, the actual and the casual, As the actual,  He
became all that has manifested in creation.  Such  statements  categorically
qualify the Supreme Lord's paramount  position  and  establish  His  eternal
presence within all insentient  names  and  forms  as  well  as  within  the
sentient <i>atma</i>  everywhere  throughout  all  creation.  The  primary  meaning
expressing cause and effect denotes the ultimate reality and is the  Supreme
Lord.  Therefore   concerning   the   doctrine   of   specific   monism   of
Ramanujacarya, that the Supreme Lord's  manifestation  as  the  <i>brahman</i>  has
devolved  itself  into  subtle  and  gross  as  well  as  the  sentient  and
insentient is completely tenable because the Supreme Lord is  the  both  the
cause and effect.
<p>
Some scholars by division try to omit the all comprehensive cohesiveness  of
the Supreme Lord by establishing that the  sentient  embodied  soul  is  the
enjoyer and the insentient  world  is  the  object  of  enjoyment  with  the
<i>brahman</i> being the controller of both trying to exemplify that the  form  and
nature of each  is  totally  different.  They  quote  the  non-contradictory
nature of the Vedic scriptures as  well  stating  that  a  quantity  of  any
substantive can be considered as being non-different from that  substantive.
At the same time they propose that the  quantity  and  the  substantive  can
also be different on the basis of not being of similar nature and form;  but
they fail to realise that both are nothing but different  manifestations  of
the one Supreme Lord. They also propound that the <i>brahman</i> is both   sentient
and insentient but this is  impossible  as  neither  of  them  can  ever  be
qualified quantities comparable  to  the  <i>brahman</i>  which  is  the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. By simple logic it can be seen that  the
quantity of any sentient substance automatically excludes it from being  the
same as the quantity of any  insentient  substance  and  vice  versa  so  by
definition it is clearly not  possible.  Once  they  realise  the  unity  of
difference and oneness their conceptions of separate and  non-separate  will
be correctly comprehended according  to  the  proper  understanding  of  the
Vedic scriptures.  The Chandogya Upanisad VI.VIII.VII  states:  The  Supreme
Lord is one without a  second  which  determines  that  the  <i>brahman</i>  as  an
absolute manifestation of the Supreme Lord is also one without a second  and
is one underlying energy throughout existence. Thus both  the  sentient  and
animate as well as the insentient and inanimate are  included  but  have  no
influence upon the <i>brahman</i> in the same way as  all  unlimited  objects  that
sun rays shine upon have absolutely no influence upon the sun.
<p>
In this way the doctrine of Ramanujacarya's specific monism contains  not  a
single contradiction to any of the Vedic scriptures. Neither has he  written
anything that needs to be excluded for when something  is  excluded  it  can
never be established. In this case there is not  a  single  thing  excluding
another just a  comprehensive  whole.  So  there  is  no  question  of  ever
excluding anything from Ramanujacarya's writings and  the  only  thing  that
may be excluded is the mundane  scholars  divisive  interpretations  of  the
Supreme Absolute truth.
<p>
There is also no evidence from  any  Vedic  scripture  suggesting  that  the
sentient and insentient are wholistic qualified quantities respectively  for
logically each must always exclude the  other.   Therefore  similar  to  the
adherents of <i>mayavada</i> impersonalism or those who fallaciously deny that  the
Supreme Lord has qualities,  attributes  and  personality  and  who  try  to
impose the concept of nescience  as  being  part  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  and  the
Supreme absolute truth fail to understand that such imposition  is  contrary
to the Vedic scriptures and  the  direct  perception  of  enlightened  self-
realised beings. In the same way the concept  of  specific  and  fluctuating
monism is also fallacious and is hypothesised by those out of ignorance  and
foolish  obstinacy  who  ignore  the  evidence  established  in  the   Vedic
scriptures and who deny the proof of enlightened beings  who  perceived  the
same by direct perception.
<p>
