Next it might be questioned why do the wise not lament  for  the  living  or
the dead? Lord Krishna here gives the reason to this establishing  that  the
soul is eternal and not the physical body. The  words  na  and  eva  meaning
certainly never, destroys any conception of the physical body being able  to
ever be equated with the soul. As the Ultimate  Soul  among  all  individual
souls it is not that the Supreme Lord did not exist before this time for  He
always existed. Similarly it is not that Arjuna and all  the  kings  on  the
battlefield did not exist before this time, for they all  certainly  existed
for the immortal soul transmigrates from body to body. By the  authority  of
Bhagavad-Gita this verse spoken by the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  refutes  such
statements as: and it is not again shall we all  exist  hereafter  from  the
present time till the end to come, meaning that indeed we shall  all  exist.
So this explains and puts into the proper  perspective  the  dissolution  of
the  material  manifestation  at  the  time  of  universal  destruction.  By
negating the origin and destruction of  the  soul,  its  very  existence  is
proved in the middle. In this way the  souls  existence  is  proven  in  all
three being creation, maintenance and destruction. All  souls  are  immortal
being eternal and hence should never be grieved for.
