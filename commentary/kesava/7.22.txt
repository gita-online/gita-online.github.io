Endowed with firm faith by the Supreme Lord, one supplicating the demi-gods
who is desirous of rewards obtains those desired rewards which undoubtedly
were destined by gratifying them. But as declared in the Vedic scriptures:
It is the Supreme Lord who is the controller of all actions, abode of all
beings and the only creator, preserver and destroyer of all creation; yet
possessing no material qualities and free from maya. Salutations to Him the
veritable goal of all worship. It is by the potency of the Supreme Lord
that universal order is maintained and He is well known as the bestower of
all rewards. If one were to wonder that if a votary paying homage to the
demigods gets their cherished desires fulfilled by them independently then
how does the Supreme Lord contribute to this. Lord Krishna answers this
with the word mayaiva meaning by Him alone. As the Supreme soul within
every sentient being, all actions and all rewards are ordained solely by
Him.
