Previously in verse 22 Lord Krishna revealed that His vibhuti or divine,
transcendental opulence from the Vedas is the Sama Veda. Now He specifies
that His vibhuti within the Sama Veda is the hymn known as Brhat-Sama
indicated in the Rig Veda VI.XXXXVI.I beginning tvam rddhim havamahe
meaning O'Indra we invoke you. This hymn is a very wonderfully sublime
auspicious hymn with a very beautiful melody glorifying the Supreme Lord
when He assumed the position of Indra during His manvantara incarnation as
Dharmasetu. Of mantras composed in long and short meters His vibhuti is the
Gayatri mantras which Vedic initiates attain Brahmin status and who then by
chanting in the three regulated periods of the day being before sunrise,
midday and after sunset perform the three sacred sacrifices which are the
lifetime duty of every Brahmin. It is also chanted while the Soma ritual is
being performed by the demigods.
