The Supreme Lord is the witness of all actions good and  evil  performed  by
beings. He is the refuge, the shelter offering protection  and  neutralising
all evil influences. He is the imperishable root seed of  all,  the  eternal
well wisher the origin and source of all creation as well as the  terminator
of creation along with  being  the  depository  and  resting  place  of  all
creation.
