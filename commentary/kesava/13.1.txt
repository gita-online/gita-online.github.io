In the first six chapters of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita known as  the  Karma  Yoga
section, Lord Krishna described the true  nature  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal
soul, which is the sole objective of realisation and the means  to  perceive
it by either <i>jnana yoga</i> or the path of spiritual  knowledge  or  <i>karma  yoga</i>
the path of spiritual activities. In the second six chapters  known  as  the
Bhakti Yoga section, Lord Krishna explains the true nature  of  the  Supreme
Lord, who is the ultimate goal of attainment along  with  precise  knowledge
of His glory, majesty and supremacy revealing in conclusion that  <i>bhakti</i>  or
exclusive loving devotion is the most superior of  processes  for  attaining
the Supreme Lord as it is the most profound means as  well  as  the  topmost
goal of human existence. Now in the final six chapters known  as  the  Jnana
Yoga section, Lord Krishna expands on the  topics  of  penance,  detachment,
the three types of sacrifice, etc. that were not  fully  delineated  in  the
previous 12 chapters. The true nature of  god-realisation  achieved  by  the
those  qualified  by  <i>bhakti</i>  possessing  godly  endowments   of   spiritual
attributes as well as knowledge and renunciation are exclusively  enraptured
by and devoted to the Supreme Lord Krishna.

Now in this  chapter  Lord  Krishna  begins  describing  the  discriminative
knowledge of matter and spirit along  with  the  process  of  assisting  His
devotees transcend the ocean of <i>samsara</i> or  the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth
death. Lord Krishna declared in chapter 12 verse 7 that He quickly  delivers
His unalloyed devotees from <i>samsara.</i> Although He has  previously  spoken  of
the physical body as the inferior part and the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul  as  the
superior part as given in chapter 8, verse 5, He now describes the  combined
nature of both with the words <i>idam sariram</i> meaning the material body,  which
is constituted of the five elements, five senses, mind and false ego and  is
the source of enjoying material delights for <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings,  who
being bewildered by illusion think of themselves as male  or  female  or  as
old and young, etc. thinking themselves to be the  physical  body  oblivious
that the <i>atma</i> is distinctly different and separate from  the  physical  body
they inhabit. This physical body is known as the <i>ksetra</i> or  field  which  is
the source of enjoying the harvest of pleasures and pain  as  the  reactions
to good and evil actions by the doer. Just as a well  planted  field  yields
abundant results and a poorly planted field yields  poor  results.  One  who
has realised that the <i>atma</i> is not the same and different from the <i>ksetra</i>  is
factually a <i>ksetra-jna</i> one who is a knower of truth. This is the  conclusion
of knowledgeable persons well versed in the spiritual truths  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. Although ordinary beings are under the misconception  that  they
are the physical body, believing themselves to be male or female,  young  or
old etc., and convinced that when their physical body feels  happiness  they
are joyful and when their physical body feels unhappiness they are sad.  The
word <i>sariram</i> meaning the physical body denotes etymologically as that  which
decays.  Still  there  are  many  in  this  world  that  are  competent   to
discriminate between the two and  this  Lord  Krishna  emphasises  with  the
words <i>tat-vidah</i> meaning persons  endowed  with  knowledge  of  the  absolute
truth. So the conclusion is that although ordinary beings  who  are  steeped
in ignorance do not have  the  qualification  to  discriminate  between  the
external physical body and the internal <i>atma;</i> the devotees of  Lord  Krishna
have qualified themselves by hearing from the bonafide spiritual master  and
studying the Vedic scriptures are able to discriminate  between  the  <i>ksetra</i>
and the <i>atma.</i>
