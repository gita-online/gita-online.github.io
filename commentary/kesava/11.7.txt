Now Lord Krishna emphasises clearly that the  total  material  manifestation
consisting  of  unlimited  things,  animate  and   inanimate,   moving   and
stationary, sentient and insentient all are  harmoniously  comprised  within
only a part of His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form.  Not  only  that  but
also creation, evolution, dissolution, past, present, future are also  there
to be seen. There should be absolutely no doubts about this reality.
