Lord Krishna now clarifies that the eight-fold nature he spoke about in  the
previous verse is from His lower inferior nature  because  it  is  inanimate
and insentient but He has a higher superior  nature  which  constitutes  the
life force of all living beings as the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul  which  sustains
the whole creation. The physical  body  the  lower  nature  is  factually  a
corporeal inanimate object into which the animate  <i>atma</i>  the  higher  nature
has entered and taken up residence. Both the animate and inanimate  make  up
the higher and lower natures of  the  <i>prakriti</i>  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  The
Vishnu Purana states that although the  <i>atma</i>  is  part  and  parcel  of  the
higher superior nature it is still  understood  to  be  subservient  to  the
Supreme Lord.
