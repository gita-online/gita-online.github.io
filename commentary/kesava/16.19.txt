So now the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  gives  the  final  conclusion  for  this
chapter. Because  absolutely no benefit is ordained for  those  who  do  not
adhere to and follow the injunctions and ordinances of the Vedic  scriptures
it has been unequivocally determined  that  only  by  the  Vedic  scriptures
exclusively and their corroborative adjuncts such as Puranas, Upanisad  etc.
which are endowed with knowledge of the Supreme  Ultimate  truth,  cognition
of the Ultimate reality and realisation of the Supreme  Ultimate  Being  are
the only authority to  be  used  in  understanding  what  is  proper  to  be
performed and what is improper and not to be  performed.  Knowing  this  one
should perform activities in material existence which correspond and are  in
harmony with the axioms and instructions of the Vedic  scriptures  according
to time, circumstances and qualification.
<p>
Thus in the sixteenth chapter the Supreme Lord Krishna  after  first  avidly
describing the qualities and attributes of those  endowed  with  the  divine
nature; He emphatically instructed complete avoidance of all aspects of  the
demoniac nature, explaining its root causes as lust,  greed  and  anger.  He
also described numerous characteristics and examples that indicate one of  a
demoniac nature possess.  His conclusion is that  one  should  only  perform
actions authorised by the Vedic scriptures and never act contrary.
<p>
I take full refuge in the Supreme Lord Krishna, He who is  the  most  worthy
of knowing and the goal of the Vedas, who  in  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  became
the spiritual master and taught the conclusions of the Vedic scriptures.
