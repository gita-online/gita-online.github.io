Having clearly described the demoniac characteristics  to  be  rejected  and
avoided,  Lord  Krishna  establishes  the  quality   based   gradations   of
activities performed in  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature.
Activities such as rituals, penance and charity if  characterised  with  the
quality of <i>sattva guna</i> are  to  be  embraced  but  if  they  are  contrarily
characterised by the quality of <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion or  <i>tama  guna</i>
the mode of ignorance they are to be avoided. Lord  Krishna  commences  with
the gradations of food as food is the support of all life and the purity  of
the mentality is dependent upon the purity of the food.  This  is  confirmed
in Chandogya Upanisad VI.VI.III beginning  <i>apam  somya  piyam  ananam</i>  which
states: The essence of whatever food is  eaten  rises  up  and  becomes  the
mind. From  pure  nourishment  manifests  a  pure  nature;  for  the  mental
disposition determines the quality  of  propitiation  by  rituals  which  is
influenced by the <i>guna</i> one is situated in. The food of every human being  is
eaten according to circumstances  regarding  likes  and  dislikes  which  is
governed  by  their  innate  nature   corroborated   by   their   particular
preponderance to one of the three <i>gunas</i> only. There is no fourth  choice  or
other alternative.
