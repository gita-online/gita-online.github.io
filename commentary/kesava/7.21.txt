If one were to propound that the Supreme Lord is the aggregate  of  all  the
demigods and that the demigods are the forms of the Supreme  Lord  as  well.
This argument is refuted by Lord  Krishna  stating  <i>yam  yam  tanum</i>  meaning
whichever form of demigod or other gods that  one  craves  for  some  reward
seeking to gratify  their  desires  by  worshipping  or  causing  others  to
worship; it is the Supreme Lord  only  and  who  keeps  the  faith  of  that
individual directed towards the very demigod that one contemplates,  keeping
it firm and steady based  upon  their  latent  tendencies  from  innumerable
previous lives. But it should be noted that although  Lord  Krishna  is  the
Supreme  Lord  of  all,  possessing  absolute  power  over   everything   in
existence; He never exerts even the slightest influence  over  any  embodied
being to put their faith and devotion in Him.
