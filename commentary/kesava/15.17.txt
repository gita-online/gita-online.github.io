One may not comprehend that the Supreme Being and Lord Krishna are the  same
because of the fact that Lord Krishna, Himself refers to the  Supreme  being
as  interpenetrating  all  the   worlds.   To   remove   any   vestiges   of
misunderstanding Lord Krishna construes this  verse  with  the  etymological
expression of  the  preceeding  verse  with  Himself  in  the  first  person
singular  stating:  Since  I  am  transcendental  to  <i>ksarah</i>  which  is  the
perishable, the insentient, material nature as  well  as  transcendental  to
<i>aksarah</i> the imperishable, the  eternal,  the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul;  the
Supreme Lord is known as <i>Purusottama</i> the  Supreme  Being.  The  Svetasvatara
Upanisad VI.XVI beginning <i>sa  vishva  krid  vishva  avid  atma</i>  states:  The
Supreme Being is the  creator  of  everything  as  well  as  the  knower  of
everything. He is also the absolute controller  of  everything.  He  is  the
cause of liberation from material existence by the <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings
and it is due to aversion to Him that <i>jivas</i> are  entangled  in  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death. The  Vishnu  Sahasranama,  verse  16  is
states that the Supreme Lord is paramount  among  all  beings.  The  Puranas
glorify Him as the Supreme Sovereign of  all  that  exists  and  the  Narada
Pancaratra states: O Supreme Lord as you are  the  Supreme  Being  you  must
save me for I am extremely unfortunate drowning in  the  ocean  of  material
existence. In this way Lord Krishna is known in the world and in  the  Vedic
scriptures as <i>Purusottama.</i>
