Lord Krishna speaks of  more  qualified  <i>yogis</i>  or  one  who  practices  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness. These <i>yogis</i> are free  from  attachment  to  external
sense objects because their senses are already under  complete  control.  In
this way they offer all their senses such as seeing and hearing and all  the
natural functions of the body such as speaking, eating,  drinking  and  even
breathing as they offer the inhalation into the exhalation and  vice  versa.
Eructation of the body such as the belching  sound  heard  from  eating  and
drinking is to keep the body balanced by letting out air. All  these  things
these <i>yogis</i> offer in the fire  of  self-purification  because  by  doing  so
all negative effects are consumed. This allows the  mind  to  be  controlled
and not diverted to extraneous things making  it  qualified  for  meditation
kindled by wisdom giving firm resolve and  fixed  determination  to  achieve
the goal of <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation.
