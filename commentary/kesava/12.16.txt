Lord Krishna  has  categorically  presented  the  essential  virtues  to  be
cultivated for His devotee desiring to serve Him with  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive
loving devotion. Now He concludes this chapter  with  the  affirmation  that
<i>bhakti</i> is  the  paramount  path  of  <i>dharma</i>  or  eternal  righteousness  and
immortality. <i>Amrtam</i> infers nectar of the gods which leads  to   immortality.
Those  devotees  with  firm  faith  whose  sins  have  been  eradicated   by
performing renounced activities for thousands of  previous  births  and  who
are imbued with the virtues given in the previous seven verses take  to  the
path of <i>bhakti</i> with their minds completely focused upon Lord Krishna as  the
be all of their existence. This was alluded to in verse two of this  chapter
with <i>mayy-avesya mano</i> meaning absorb themselves fully  in  thoughts  of  Him
and in verse seven <i>mat-parah</i> meaning take full refuge in Him  alone.  In  <i>ye</i>
<i>tu</i> meaning and of all those persons the particle <i>tu</i> denotes that  this  last
instruction takes precedence and is superior to all the  individual  virtues
described  in  the   previous  seven  verses.  Such  devotees  of  His   who
resolutely follow the righteous and noble path  of  <i>bhakti</i>   are  without  a
doubt the most dear to Him of all.
