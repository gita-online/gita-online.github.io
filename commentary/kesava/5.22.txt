After expounding that desire and sense  gratification  are  the  sources  of
misery and suffering, Lord Krishna establishes that  steadfast  devotion  to
the eternal <i>atma</i> or soul is the source of eternal  bliss.  One  may  protest
that without sensual pleasures life would  have  no  taste.  To  refute  the
hyperbole of this mentality  and  to  fortify  the  aspirants  of  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation Lord Krishna strengthens the concept by the word  <i>sodhum</i>  meaning
to tolerate or withstand. Withstand what?  Withstand  the  impulses  arising
from <i>kama</i> or lust and <i>krodha</i> or anger. These impulses are very powerful  and
difficult like the strong current of a river. <i>Kama</i> is described  as  intense
desire for sense objects which infatuate the mind due to increasing  passion
from seeing, hearing about or  remembering  objects  of  desire.  <i>Krodha</i>  is
described as the modification of the mind in the form  of  anger  caused  by
extreme situations of frustration in  not  obtaining  the  result  of  one's
desires. The person who is able to tolerate this impulses  and  subsequently
neutralise them by spiritual practices even before the  end  of  life  is  a
<i>yogi</i> or one who has perfected the science of  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness.  Such  a  being  is
spiritually situated and is undoubtedly joyful  and  content.  Such  persons
and no others are qualified to accomplish the goal of  human  existence  and
succeed in the achievement of <i>atma tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  eternal
soul within all naturally created beings. One who slavishly  always  follows
the urges of sensual pleasures, like an animal is unable  to  control  their
mind and therefore is unable to accomplish this goal.
