Lord Krishna now speaks of <i>pranayama</i> or breath  control.  Others  offer  the
<i>prana</i> or exhalation into <i>apana</i> or inhaling breath and then again  the  <i>apana</i>
into the <i>prana.</i> This is also considered as <i>yagna</i> or  offerings  of  worship.
How do they do this? It is done by the process of <i>kumbhaka</i> or the  cessation
of the breath between inhalation and exhalation.  In  this  way  they  offer
their every breath in <i>yagna.</i> In the next verse Lord Krishna tells about  the
rewards for those who perform such <i>yagnas</i>  as  mentioned  above.  Performing
means they know the specific purpose for why and what  they  are  performing
such <i>yagnas</i> as well as how to perform it properly  according  to  the  Vedic
saciptures and by doing so in this manner they have absolved their sins.
