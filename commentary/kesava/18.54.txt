If one takes full shelter of the Supreme Lord with the  mind  fixed  on  Him
while performing every activity.  All  obstacles  and  difficulties  by  His
grace will be overcome. But if out of pride or  vanity  one  disregards  the
instructions of the Supreme Lord Krishna  thinking  that  one  knows  better
then the eternal wisdom of the Vedic scriptures which originated  from  Him.
Then one is doomed  and  will  be  deprived  of  the  four  goals  of  human
existence: <i>kama</i> or enjoyment, <i>artha</i> or wealth, <i>dharma</i> or  righteousness  and
<i>moksa</i>  or liberation from material existence. One will  thus  be  forced  to
continue to rot in <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death.
