Lord Krishna speaks of the boundless happiness experienced by  such  a  <i>yogi</i>
or one perfected in the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness.  The   sinless   <i>yogi</i>   whose
accumulative reactions have all evaporated by continuous meditation  on  the
<i>atma</i> or  soul  within  the  etheric  heart  and  easily  achieves  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from the material existence and is blest with the  eternal  bliss
of communion with <i>paramatam</i> the supreme soul.
