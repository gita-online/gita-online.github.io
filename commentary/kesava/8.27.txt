The result of comprehending the two routes: both the path of light which
gives moksa or liberation from material existence and the path of darkness
which gives bondage to the material existence is that the yogi or one
perfecting the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion
with the ultimate consciousness, whether a jnani devoted to spiritual
knowledge of the Supreme or a jijnasuh devoted to meditation on the atma or
soul. Both becomes firmly established in equanimity and are never again
deluded by maya or illusory impressions superimposed upon the mind. In
other words they are clear as to what is to be done and what is not to be
done in able to say continuously focused on the Supreme Lord. Such a yogi
performs no actions with a desire to attain any rewards on Earth or even to
reach the heavenly spheres by which desiring one is guaranteed rebirth
again from another womb. Therefore the conclusion is to remain always
attentive and established in yoga and traverse forever this ever changing,
precarious material existence.
