The question may arise that a person possessing the characteristics  of  the
previous verse with a pure heart and controlled senses may be unaffected  by
reactions to actions; but how can those without such characteristics  become
unattached to desire for the rewards of actions. Lord Krishna  answers  this
by instructing everyone to offer and dedicate all  actions  to  the  Supreme
Lord. The desire for rewards of actions is the fundamental  reason  for  all
ego conceptions of being the physical body and the root cause of <i>samsara</i>  or
bondage in the cycle of birth and death which so viciously  apprehends  one.
So desire for rewards should  be immediately be given up so one will not  be
contaminated by sinful reactions.
