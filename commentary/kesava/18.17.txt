Lord Krishna reaffirms that one who is free from egoism and the  notions  of
I did this and I did that is not  bound  by  actions  and  there  consequent
reactions. The state of egolessness is the  result  of  a  preponderance  of
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness and such affinity is  the  doorway  leading
to spiritual knowledge. So in  order  to  present  the  threefold  types  of
action and their performance He  speaks  of  knowledge  infering  about  the
action, the  object  of  knowledge,  the  qualified  agent,  the  prescribed
procedure, the knower of the ritual to the Supreme  Lord  and  the  perfomer
thereof. These threefold factors of knowledge, the knowable and  the  knower
form the basis  that  motivates  all  actions  in  the  form  of  initiating
actions, instructing  actions  and  directing  actions,  etc.  It  has  been
declared by the 8th century pandit Kumarila Bhatta who was  responsible  for
defeating innumerable propounders  of  impersonalistic  conceptions  of  the
Supreme Lord: That directing, instructing and enjoining are all of the  same
idea. The action as the object of knowledge is also  threefold.  As  <i>mantras</i>
or sacred incantations  are  the  most  effacious  means  for  invoking  and
propitaiating the Supreme  Lord,  ass  the  hands  are  the  most  effective
instruments for offering oblations to the Supreme Lord and as  the  <i>sruk</i>  or
ladle is the most  effective  instrument  for  pouring  ghees  or  clarified
butter in the sacred fire. In the same way the Vedic ritual is  accomplished
by the actions of the performer of the action who is  merely  an  instrument
alsol and not the actual doer as the previously explained factors  factually
constitute all actions.
