Lord Krishna now confirms that the same  eternal  <i>yoga</i>  or  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness  that  was  imparted  aeons  before  to  Visvavan   is   being
instructed to His friend Arjuna and no one else. Why no  one  else?  Because
Arjuna was  qualified  to  receive  this  <i>yoga,</i>  and  because  he  was  Lord
Krishna's surrendered disciple. As  this  <i>yoga</i>  is  highly  confidential  it
should not be revealed to those who have no  faith  nor  to  those  who  are
unqualified.
