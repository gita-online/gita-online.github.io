Here Lord Krishna is explaining that there is no difficulty in  the  absence
of control of the  senses if the mind is firmly under control. This  answers
the last question of, How does such a one  walk  or  act?  The  particle  tu

controlled aspirant who has their firmly inder  control  while  experiencing
various sense objects through their disciplined senses which are  free  from
aversion and attraction, achieves placidity and tranquillity of  mind.  This
means that the mind has becomes purified.
