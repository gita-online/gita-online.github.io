Among non-poisonous  serpents  of  many  heads  Lord  Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
divine, transcendental opulence is the divine snake Ananta endowed with  the
qualities of dispassion, mightiness,  etc.  Among  the  controllers  of  the
demigods who  direct  universal  management  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  is  Yamaraja  the
demigod in charge of death  who  blesses  the  righteous  and  punishes  the
unrighteous.
