Just as it is impossible for one in a room full  of  smoke  to  avoid  being
affected and influenced; similarly for one existing in  this  transmigratory
world of birth and death it  is  impossible  to  avoid  being  affected  and
influenced. So how then is it possible to remain untouched in  this  strange
world of continuous rebirth into new physical bodies? Lord Krishna uses  the
words <i>ihaiva</i> in this very life  to  emphasise  that  those  who  have  equal
vision by perception of the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul  residing  equally  in  all
beings partake of its eternal transcendental nature and thus have ended  the
cycle of transmigration and are untouched  by  reactions  to  actions  which
hurls one incessantly into the material existence. Those who are  bewildered
and infatuated with delusion  experience  this  world  as  unfathomable  and
become recipients of <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death.
Those who achieve <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul  and  perceive  the
<i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence  as  well  attain
victory over rebirth into this transmigratory world and <i>moksa</i> or  liberation
from the material existence.
<p>
The <i>atma</i> or soul has been declared to be imperishable having  indestructible
attributes. It is always untouched by qualities of  the  physical  body  and
the subtle body and is unmodifiable and eternal. Although  the  <i>atma</i>  exists
in the bodies of all types of beings  and  this  includes  demi-god,  human,
animal, plant and  fish;  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul  is  never  present  within  a
genetically created  clone,  neither  can  the  <i>atma</i>  ever  be  artificially
manipulated to reside in the body of a genetically created clone.
