So requested Lord Krishna  agrees  to  reveal  more  about  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
divine, transcendental opulence; but only those most prominent as  there  is
no limit to His opulence and His glories are endless. The  use  of  vocative
particle  <i>hanta</i>  inferring  dear  one  is  very   personal   and   indicates
compassionate affection.
