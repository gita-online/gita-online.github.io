It should not be speculated that one is entitled to the fruits
of oneâs actions simply  because  it  is  impossibe  to  fully
renounce all actions. To  empasise  this  point  Lord  Krishna
states vimudh-atma meaning one ignorant of the soul. A fool or
a wise person can appear inactive without engaging in  worldly
affairs or  Vedic  activities.  So  the  sense  here  is  that
prakriti, material nature is propelling one to  act  based  on
the effects of oneâs past actions which are  attached  to  the
root of the physical and subtle body. Therefore the conclusion
is that one should first purify themselves by performing karma
yoga which is actions without desires  as  prescribed  in  the
Vedas which destroys sins which hinder  spiritual  development
before embarking on the path of jnana yoga the cultivation  of
spiritual knowledge.
