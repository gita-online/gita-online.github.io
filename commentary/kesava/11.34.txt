<p><div align=justify>Lord Krishna is addressed as <i>Hrsikesha</i> meaning the inner controller  of  the
mind and senses. Although Lord Krishna's power is infinite at the same  time
He has great love for His  devotees, this is evidenced by  His  deigning  to
be the charioteer of His devotee. The whole creation and all  the  hosts  of
heavenly  beings  including  the  <i>Devas</i>  or  demigods,  Gandarvas,   Yaksas,
Kinnaras etc. all rejoice and exult and are filled with love  chanting  Lord
Krishna's holy names, attributes and glories. But the  terrified  demons  in
great  fear  and  anxiety  are  fleeing  in  all  directions,  dejected  and
dismayed. Whereas the hosts of perfected beings who have the power of  their
penance and acquired Vedic knowledge and attained <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from
material existence also offer  their  humble  obeisance  to  you.  The  word
<i>sthane</i> means appropriate and is used to emphasise propriety.  Arjuna  speaks
for 11 verses.
