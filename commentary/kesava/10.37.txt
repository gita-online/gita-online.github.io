Lord Krishna reveals that He is the bijam or root seed and origin of all
beings existing in all situations and manifestations. There is nothing
absolutely whatsoever animate or inanimate which can exist without Lord
Krishna as He pervades the total material existence externally as the
brahman or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence and internally
as paramatma the Supreme Soul within the etheric heart of each and every
living entity. From the primary creator Brahma above even the heavenly
planets down to a blade of grass everything in existence is inseparably
connected to Lord Krishna. As Lord Krishna is present within all causes He
is naturally present in all results as well. He is the cause of all causes.
The Svetavatara Upanisad VI.IX states: The Supreme Lord is the cause of the
lord of all causes.
