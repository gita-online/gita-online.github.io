It could be submitted that depending on ones individual  inclinations  there
are numerous merits in this world such as wealth and kingdoms all  of  which
can  be  acquired  through  regulatory  actions  prescribed  in  the   Vedic
scriptures; while for the ksatriya rulers in general being  without  enemies
is preferable. It may be put forth that Arjuna  himself  should  decide  and
act; but the reply is that one in delusion needs to hear  knowledge  of  the
ultimate truth from those who are qualified and who is more  qualified  than
the Supreme Lord.  Knowledge of the Ultimate  Truth  helps  one  cross  over
this delusion. Wealth and kingdoms are  not  the  means  for  crossing  this
delusion  and  Arjuna  asserts  this  with  the  words  na   or   not.   The
understanding of it is even  if  he  was  to  win  a  kingdom  of  unrivaled
prosperity free from enemies, Arjuna  still  could  not  see  any  means  of
alleviating the grief that was drying up his senses. By the use of the  word
hi meaning certainly the conviction that he could not see  any  solution  to
his grief is reinforced, indicating that only the Lord is  fit  to  instruct
him.
