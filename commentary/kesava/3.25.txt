So one established as a person of spiritual wisdom should also
perform prescribed Vedic actions without attachment  in  order
to guide the masses down the path  of  virtue  to  redemption.
Those  devoid  of  knowledge  of  the  Upanisads   work   with
attachment engrossed totally in their actions. But the  person
of spiritual wisdom being able  to  discriminate  between  the
atma or soul and the physical body is not perplexed and should
act in an exemplary manner that inspires the public to perform
prescribed  Vedic  actions  as  a  matter  of   duty   without
attachment for the good of society.  This  what  Lord  Krishna
means in this verse.
