Although Arjuna was bewildered he could still understand  that
Lord Krishna valued the cultivation of spiritual knowledge  as
being superior to activities without attachment and  he  could
also understand that if Lord Krishna was ordering him to fight
this must be also for his betterement as well,  The  Lord  did
not specify which path Arjuna was qualified  for  as  yet  and
thus Arjuna was in a dilemna and needed  a  clear,  definitive
instruction that would end his  confusion.  Arjuna  is  humbly
requesting this with the  underlying  request  that  the  most
merciful and compassionate Supreme Lord  should  not  bewilder
the mind of one who is His surrenderd devotee.
