Lord Krishna describing the two paths as eternal concludes by reiterating
that those who practice the path of knowledge take the route of light
presided over by the all effulgent Agni the demigod of fire and those who
practice the path of action take the route of darkness presided over by the
demigod of smoke. Both are eternal and beginingless. Preceding by the route
of light the qualified yogi or one perfecting the individual consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness is not reborn again in
the world of mortals but eventually achieves moksa or liberation from
material existence. The aspirant who performs meritoious activities with
the desire for rewards in this life and the hereafter must return to
material existence and take birth again.
