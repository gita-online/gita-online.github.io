Lord Krishna is confirming that it is not possible to become established  in
<i>yoga</i> or the science of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion
with the ultimate consciousness by <i>dhyana</i> or meditation. To behold all  with
equanimity and dispassion is not possible for one  whose  mind  is  restless
and uncontrolled. But through ceaseless striving and  constantly  practising
of meditation it is possible to be successful in controlling it.
