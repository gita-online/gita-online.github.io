In order to continue the previous verse Lord Krishna presents  <i>prakriti</i>  the
material substratum in eight  categories  representing  His  lower  material
energy comprised of earth, water, fire, air and ether  and  they  stand  for
their respective elements in their  subtle  state  being  seeing,  smelling,
hearing, touching and tasting  which are in their modified  state  and  thus
cannot be considered as constituents of nature. <i>Manas</i> or mind  which  stands
for its cause being the  intellect  and  <i>ahankarah</i>  being  false  ego  which
stands for cosmic intelligence as well as the individual  ego  which  stands
for <i>maya</i> the  illusory  deluding  energy  which  is  the  cause   of  cosmic
intelligence. All this is the potency  of  Lord  Krishna  and  the  material
cause of creation consisting of sixteen movable and immovable  modifications
in the form of five subtle elements, five organs with five  senses  and  the
mind all from His lower nature divided into eight categories.
