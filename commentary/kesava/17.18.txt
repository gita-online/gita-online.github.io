Now Lord Krishna explains the <i>danam</i> or charity that is given  in  <i>raja  guna</i>
the mode of passion. The <i>danam</i> that is  given  reluctantly,  that  is  given
grudgingly, that is given with the desire of receiving something  in  return
or that is given with the hope of gaining a reward in the next life such  as
promotion to the heavenly planets is known to be  firmly  situated  in  <i>raja</i>
<i>guna.</i> The particle <i>tu</i> meaning  however  indicates  that  this  mentality  is
inferior to that of those situated in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
