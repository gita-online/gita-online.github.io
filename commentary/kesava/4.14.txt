One may wonder how is it possible that Lord Krishna  is  not  implicated  by
any actions and that reactions to actions are  not  applicable  to  Him?  To
understand this one should look at it in the  following  way.  Although  the
growth of mangoes, rice  and  papayas  are  undoubtedly  supported  by  rain
showers, the rain has no attachment not having any desire  for  tasting  and
enjoying the fruits.  Similarly in this creation  containing  various  human
beings characterised by divine and demoniac  natures,  possessing  good  and
evil  propensities,  performing  righteous  or   unrighteous   actions   and
receiving the bestowal of their reactions it is  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
who sanctions these rewards. But there is no partiality or injustice  coming
from Him every human being creates their own <i>karma</i> or reactions  to  actions
defined by the actions they have been performing life after life since  time
immemorial. In Brahma Sutras II.III.XXXIV written  by  Vedavyasa  it  states
that: Partiality and injustice can never be attributed to the  Supreme  Lord
as there are other considerations that must be taken into account  and  this
is because the Vedic scriptures have declared it so. Lord  Krishna  confirms
here that even those who know Him as the origin  of  creation  and  all  the
worlds  and  know  that  He  is  not  implicated  by  any   activity   being
transcendental to <i>prakrit</i> or material nature; these  individuals  also  have
their desires and worldly attachments terminated and are not bound by  their
actions.
