Lord Krishna is stating that one who regards equally the  well-wishers  such
as relatives who  help  due  to  relations  and  friends  who  help  due  to
affection without desiring anything from them  and  is  also  nonplussed  by
those who wish to do harm such as an enemy or the envious, as well as  those
of righteous conduct and those of unrighteous conduct, such a person  excels
even the <i>yogi</i> or one perfecting the science of the individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness.
