Now Lord Krishna gives an example regarding the support  and  the  supported
and how they are seperatly existing without contact. Just  as  the  wind  is
moving upwards, downwards  and  crosswise  through  the  ether  of  infinite
space; yet never attached to the ether or the space. In a  similar  way  the
Supreme Lord is also not subject to  any  attachments  although  all  living
entities movable and non-movable abide and function within  Him.  It  should
be understood that although He is the underlying  maintainer  and  sustainer
of all creation, He is free from any attachment to the incessantly  changing
transitory forms of material nature.
