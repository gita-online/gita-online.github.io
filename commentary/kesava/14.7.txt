Here Lord Krishna explains <i>raja guna</i> or the mode of  passion  and  describes
how it binds the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being to material existence.  The  quality
of passion gives the impetus to perform activities for the desire  of  sense
gratification and identifying in the mind such sense objects to  be  enjoyed
by the senses. Desire is the hankering for the acquisition of objects to  be
acquired and attachment is obsession for  objects  that  have  already  been
acquired. This <i>rajas</i> tightly binds the <i>jiva</i> through incessant  readiness  to
perform actions to satisfy desires and attachment to the lure  of  perceived
and unperceived results for such actions.
