It is seen that in sickness even the ignorant  who  are  not  developed  are
able to control their senses from sensual objects. So how can not  impelling
the senses towards sense objects be  considered  to  be  indicative  to  one
situated in transcendent meditation. Lord  Krishna  replies  with  the  word
visayah objects of the senses. The enjoyments of sound, sight,  touch,  etc.
cease completely for the one who is ill having no desire to enjoy  with  the
senses anything due to weakness in the overall power of  the  sense  organs.
Although  this  is  true  the  taste  for  these  sensual  objects  persists
remaining dormant within the mind.  The  lust  for  these  things  does  not
vanishe from the mind to the contray while recovering from  illness  one  in
anticipation is thinking of all the pleasures to be enjoyed again  once  the
sickness is finished. But all this is terminated and disappears for one  who
is sthita-prajna  situated  in  transcendent  meditation  when  such  a  one
realises the unprecedented bliss of supreme soul within.  One  who  realises
the supreme soul within is no  longer  attracted  to  the  trivial,  mundane
objects of the material  world  no  matter  how  fantastic  it  may  appear.
Worldly pleasures is no longer appealing.  The  word  param  in  this  verse
denotes Paramatma the supreme soul in every living  entity,  the  source  of
eternal bliss, devoid of all material attributes and thus is  the  exclusive
goal of everyones meditation.  This is confirmed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures
with the passage: All beings exist by but an  infintisemal  portion  of  His
bliss. All beings manifestations depend completely upon  the  grace  of  the
Supreme Lord. The nature of the  Supreme  Lord  is  complete  knowledge  and
complete supremacy.
