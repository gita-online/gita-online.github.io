So Duryodhana faced with the feeling of inadequacy reflects what  is  to  be
done? In this verse he replies that  all  of  his  army  situated  in  their
respective strategic points in their  various  positions  must  support  and
protect Bhishma very carefully, who is the commander  of  the  army.  It  is
understood that where the commander is protected the army is protected.
