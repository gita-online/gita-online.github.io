Lord Krishna speaks in this verse  of  highly  qualified  persons  who  have
directly witnessed <i>paramatma</i> or the Supreme Soul  within  the  heart.   Some
have done this by sharp intellect and discrimination  between  the  <i>atma</i>  or
the  immortal  soul  and  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading
physical existence. Referring to those having learned  the  true  nature  of
the <i>atma</i> from the spiritual master He uses the words <i>yogena</i> or the  practice
of the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion with  the
ultimate consciousness  and  they  are  established  in  meditation.  Others
achieve it by complete renunciation for results from their actions.
