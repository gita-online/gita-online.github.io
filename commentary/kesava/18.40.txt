Lord Krishna first elaborates on the duties of Brahmins according  to  their
respective natures based upon the inherent quality of <i>sattva guna</i>  the  mode
of goodness. Control of the mind and senses, engaging  in  austerities  such
as fasting and restraint as enjoined in Vedic  scriptures,  external  purity
by being physically  clean  and  internal  purity  by  free  of  desire  and
animosity. Forgiving those who have been ungrateful and hateful,  devoid  of
duplicity  having  mutual  concordance  in  body,  speech  and  mind.  Firm,
unshakeable faith in the Vedic scriptures. Knowledge of  what  is  real  and
what is illusory. Realisation of the essence  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  by
understanding the actual  non-contradictory  conclusions  of  the  seemingly
contradictory anomalies in various Vedic scriptures. Such are the duties  of
Brahmins.
