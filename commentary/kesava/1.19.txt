Addressing Lord Krishna as  <i>Acutya,</i>  the  infallible  one,  Sanjaya  repeats
Arjuna request to Lord Krishna  to  position  the  chariot  in  the  middle,
between the two firmly opposing armies indicating  the  mighty  strength  of
Lord Krishna firmness on all sides. There is  no  rule  of  warfare  stating
that one should fight in only one place. Yet why should  Arjuna  request  to
have the chariot stationed between the two armies? In this verse  he  states
that he wishes to observe those arrayed against him desiring  to  fight.  If
it is asked has he come to witness the battle as a spectator  or  to  fight?
Arjuna has no intention of being a spectator; but  to  see  those  opponents
who he is worthy to fight against and who are worthy to fight against him.
