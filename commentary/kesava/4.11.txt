So if Lord Krishna only bestows His benedictions upon those who are  devoted
to Him but not to those who are devoted to sense gratification  and  worldly
attachment then there would appear to be some injustice in this. To  correct
this idea Lord Krishna states this verse. However one approaches  Him,  with
desires or without desires, direct or indirect He rewards  them  accordingly
and this is not only for His devotees who worship Him exclusively; but  this
also applies to all those  who  worship  others  in  various  religions  and
denominations.  For it is a fact that all living beings in all  ways  follow
in all respects Lord Krishna's path  as  He  resides  as  the  supreme  soul
within all living beings. So in conclusion the Supreme Lord Krishna  is  the
ultimate dispenser of all rewards to everyone regardless to whom one  offers
their homage to; but although the rewards are in  equal  proportion  to  the
worship which was offered to Him; it should not be assumed that  worship  of
others in various religions and denominations will be equal  in  quality  or
quantity to the results of the  worship  that  was  offered  to  Him  direct
without any intermediary accept the bonafide spiritual master.
