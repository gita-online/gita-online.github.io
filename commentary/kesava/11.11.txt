Now the effulgence of Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal  form  is
being described. The word <i>divi</i> means in the firmament. If in the  heavens  a
thousand suns burst forth simultaneously  all  at  once  it  could  give  an
indication of the dazzling radiance and splendour the universal form and  no
other comparison is suitable. As 1000 suns rising simultaneously  cannot  be
envisioned except by imagination and is practically  an  impossible  reality
it is difficult to envision. Thus the comparison infers that  the  universal
form is beyond compare to anything ever seen or imagined.
