Others may speculate that just as milk  products  such  as  butter,  cheese.
cream and curds without thinking about them increasing the  fat  content  of
the  body  anyway  increase  bodily  fat  when  eaten.  Then  likewise   the
performance of prescribed Vedic  activities  even  without  desire  for  any
rewards would still yield rewards in the next life which would be  obstacles
in achieving <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence. So such  aspirants
should refrain from all actions. This conception is refuted by Lord  Krishna
as He clarifies that the result of those seeking  rewards  for  actions  are
threefold. Those actions performed  in  righteousness  are  meritorious  and
they  award  birth  in  the  heavenly  spheres.  Those   actions   performed
unrighteously are unmeritorious  leading  to  evil  consequences  and  cause
birth in the hellish planets and birth as animals. Those  actions  that  are
both a mixture of righteousness  and  unrighteousness   cause  one  to  take
birth in the human realms. This applies only to those desirious  of  rewards
for the actions they perform. For those who have renounced  the  desire  for
rewards completely they are not subject to the  threefold  births  as  there
are no rewards for them to be attached to as obstacles for achieving  <i>moksa.</i>
Thus such righteous aspirants never indulge  in  unmeritorious  conduct  and
hence  no  evil  consequences  are  attached  to  them  and  as  all   their
meritorious activities are already dedicated to  the  exclusive  satifaction
of the Supreme Lord, there is no possibilty of them being attached to  their
actions or any desire therof. So with this understanding there is  no  scope
for any doubt about this matter.
