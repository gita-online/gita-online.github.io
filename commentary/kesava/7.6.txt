Lord Krishna now reveals that He alone is the  sole  source  of  the  entire
creation and its dissolution as well. Everything  in  all  creation  movable
and immovable have manifested and evolved from His two fold  nature.  He  is
the cause of the creation of the inanimate temporary physical  body  and  He
is the cause of the animate eternal embodied <i>atma</i>  or  soul.  The  inanimate
reality is due to a  modification  of  His  propensity  as  He  becomes  the
substratum while the animate reality is the way  by  which  He  enters  into
material nature  and  enjoying  participates  and  interacts  with  it.  The
physical body cannot sustain and grow without  the  life  principle  of  the
<i>atma</i> and both the physical body and the soul are both His  powers  and  both
completely under His control. The  power  and  the  powerful  cannot  remain
separate because the source of the power is found residing in  the  powerful
only.
