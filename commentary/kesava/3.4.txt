It has been established  that  activities  prescribed  in  the
Vedic scriptures performed without anticipation of rewards are
conducive  for  spiritual  developement.  Without  this  inner
consciousness one is not  qualified  for  jnana  yoga  or  the
cultivation of spiritual knowledge. Many may wish for moksa or
liberation and attempt to renounce the world prematurely   but
they do not reach perfection only by such  renunciation.  This
is verified in the  verse  by  the  words  na  eva  sanyasanat
meaning  not  merely  by  renunciation.   So  it   should   be
understood that without purity of mind and adequate  spiritual
knowledge a person even though appearing to  be  a  renunciate
actually has not properly qualified themselves for jnana  yoga
in spite of appearances.
