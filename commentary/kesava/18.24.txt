<p><div align=justify>Those actions that are undertaken through the defect  of  not  knowing  that
absolutely everything is under the complete  control  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna.  Those  actions  that  are  engaged  in  without  considering   the
consequences of good or evil for them or determining as to  whether  or  not
one is capable of accomplishing them.  Those  actions  that  cause  harm  to
others and to oneself and that are  merely  a  waste  of  time,  energy  and
expenditure. Such actions are invariably situated in <i>tama guna</i> the  mode  of
ignorance.
