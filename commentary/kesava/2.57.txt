Lord Krishna answers the question, How does such a one sit?  With  the  word
yada meaning when, when one is in meditation they do not  let  their  senses
go out, for example like the following of sounds by the ear and compels  the
organs of action to perform only the basic functions  of  utmost  necessity.
The illustration used is of the  turtle  which  out  of  fear  of  something
protects itself by drawing its limbs and head inside its  shell.  After  the
danger passes the turtle again lets out its limbs again and in a  controlled
manner continues on its way. In  the  same  way  one  who  is  sthita-prajna
situated in the perfect knowledge of transcendent meditation acts thus.
