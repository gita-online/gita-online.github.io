For the purpose of germinating and increasing  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving
devotional service the Supreme Lord Krishna in  chapter  ten  spoke  of  His
<i>vibhuti</i> or divine transcendental opulence and at its  end  in  verse  42  He
alluded to His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form with the words  <i>eka-amsena</i>
referring to a fractional expansion of Himself. Beginning  with  chapter  2,
verse 12 <i>na tv evaham jatu nasam</i> meaning: Never was there a time  when  Lord
Krishna  did  no  exist.  Continuing  on  to  chapter  4,  verse  46   <i>yogam</i>
<i>atisthottistha</i> meaning: become a <i>yogi</i> or one perfecting the science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness. In the first four verses of this  chapter  Arjuna  begins  by
gratefully acknowledging the great compassion  of  Lord  Krishna  to  reveal
such supremely confidential knowledge regarding the eternality of  the  <i>?tma</i>
or eternal soul in comparison to the  temporary,  perishable  state  of  the
physical body and then affirms that now his delusion has been dispelled  and
the infatuation felt due to a sense of ego for the body and  mind  has  been
eradicated because it is an absolute  truth  that  the  soul  is  never  the
performer of any action.
