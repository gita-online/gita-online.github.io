Some may conclude that if those imbued with  <i>sattva  guna</i>  or  the  mode  of
goodness neither welcomes nor  avoids  actions  conducive  to  happiness  or
unhappiness, then they should not indulge in any activities at  all  because
anyway  they  are  not  desirous  of  rewards.  Contrarily  the  very   same
activities if they are motivated by desire for rewards keep one enslaved  in
<i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of birth and death. So to be  safe  it  would
be better to abandon all actions. Lord Krishna resolves this predicament  in
this verse by confirming that it is impossible  for  any  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied
being in a gross or subtle body to completely  stop  all  actions  entirely.
This  is  because  there  is  always  some  activitiy  operating   for   the
maintenance of the subtle and  physical  body  even  if  it  is  beyond  the
threshold of comsciousness. So in conclusion one who  has  relinquished  the
desire for rewards for their actions performing prescribed Vedic  activities
with <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion or performing them as a  matter  of
duty is designated as situated in  actual  renunciation  and  not  the  mere
abstainer of actions.
