When and how the mind and senses accompany the  <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  being  in
the process of transmigration from one body at the time of death to  another
at the time of conception is clarified by Lord Krishna. The purport is  that
wherever the <i>jiva</i> departs from a body and whenever it is compeled to  accept
another body the  <i>atma</i> or immortal soul migrating from one body to  another,
arrives with the subtle forms of the mind and  senses  in  tact  to  perform
their functions through the physical body which has  been  allotted  due  to
<i>karma</i> or reactions to previous actions.  The  Supreme  Lord  clarifies  this
with the analogy of the wind carrying  the  scents  of  flowers  to  various
locations.
