The Supreme Lord Krishna's magnificent is beyond the  ability  of  the  mind
and senses to fathom and comprehend. It is  declared  in  the  Brhadaranyaka
Upanisads III:VIII:X: O Gargi if one performs  ceremonial  rituals,  worship
and propitiation and undergoes rigid austerities for thousands of  lifetimes
without knowledge of Lord Krishna being the Supreme God of  all  gods;  then
the results of all such activities is limited  and  minimal  indeed.  Verily
one who having lived their span  of  life  in  the  material  existence  who
departs this world ignorant and oblivious to the reality  that  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna is the ultimate cause of their very existence as  well  as  the
source of the complete cosmic creation  is  considered  to  be  pitiful  and
their condition is lamentable. But one who departs this world at the end  of
their life knowing the absolute  paramount  position  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna is exalted. The Supreme Lord Krishna the origin and  source  of  all
things animate and inanimate is most worthy to be known to those  who  value
their  own  best  interests.  He  is  eternal,  immutable,   the   spiritual
substratum pervading all existence,  the  support,  the  preserver  and  the
refuge for all creation. There is no  change  or  diminution  in  His  form,
qualities, attributes  and  potencies.  Lord  Krishna  and  His  <i>avatars</i>  or
incarnations and expansions authorised in Vedic scriptures are  the  eternal
protector of the Vedas and the principles of righteousness  delineated  very
precisely and concisely in the Vedic  scriptures  as  they  all  are  verily
righteousness personified. The Primal Supreme Being the ancient of  all.
