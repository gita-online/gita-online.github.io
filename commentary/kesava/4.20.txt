Now Lord Krishna speaks about the non-binding effects that  the  actions  of
the spiritually intelligent insure. They are without egoism  and  unattached
to the doership of actions. Being completely satisfied  by  the  bliss  they
experience within their consciousness they maintain their  bodily  existence
by accepting what comes on its own accord. They are no  longer  affected  by
the dualities of life such as good and evil.
