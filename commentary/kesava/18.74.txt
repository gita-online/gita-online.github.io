The Supreme Lord Krishna is the absolute  controller  and  self  sustaining,
independent sovereign of all, the most  worthy  of  adoration,  worship  and
propitiation,  the  bestower  of  all  blessing  and  benedictions  and  the
creator,  maintainer,  protector  and  sustainer  of   all   creation.   The
intelligent aspirant desiring  their  own  best  welfare  should  completely
surrender unto Him accepting Him alone as their only refuge.
<p>
I bow down to the Supreme Lord Krishna, the  origin  of  all  creation,  the
ultimate source and the ultimate goal,  who  out  causeless  compassion  and
merciful magnaminity for His devotees, manifested a  ship  in  the  form  of
Srimad Bhagavad-Gita to save His devotees who are drowning in the  ocean  of
<i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death.
<p>
I seek refuge in the Supreme Lord Krishna, who  as  an  incarnation  assumed
the form of the swan Hamsa to transmit the eternal  spiritual  knowledge  of
Srimad Bhagavad-Gita to Sanaka and his brothers who  subsequently  empowered
His  Holiness  Nimbadityacarya  the  establisher  of  the  Kumara   Vaisnava
Sampradaya.
<p>
His Holiness Nimbadityacarya wrote a deep and profound commentary on  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita; but his commentary  was  so  esoteric  and  complex  that  I,
Keshava Kashmiri acquiring spiritual wisdom  by  devout  meditation  on  his
holy feet have received inspired insight into his purports with the  purpose
of simplifying the explanation while  illuminating  the  meaning.  Hence  my
commentary clearly enlightens his purports in this way and  is  factually  a
commentary on His Holiness Nimbadityacarya's commentary on Srimad  Bhagavad-
Gita.
<p>
Now this commentary known as the Enligtener  of  the  Principles  of  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita has been completed by Dig Vijaya Sri Bharati Keshava  Kashmiri
Bhattacarya.....OM Sri Krishnarpanam astu.
