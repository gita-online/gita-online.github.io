Lord Krishna having concluded an elaborate exposition on the three <i>gunas</i>  or
modes of material nature and  how  they  influence  the  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings; entitling those who are conscious of  what  is  eternally  in  their
best interest to aspire for <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material  existence  by
wholeheartedly  cultivating  the  qualities  of  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of
goodness. Now a point of contention may be raised  that  if  all  <i>jivas  are</i>
categorised in one of the three modes according to which one is  predominant
then a <i>jiva</i> for example possessing the virtues that  would  situate  one  in
<i>sattva guna</i> would have to enjoy  the  equisite  happiness  of  the  heavenly
planets with all of the rapturous but transitory pleasures of the  celestial
demigods and <i>moksa</i> will have eluded them. In such a situation how will  they
be delivered from <i>samsara</i> th perpetual cycle of birth and death  and  attain
the bliss of <i>m</i>oksa. In order to respond to such  a  question,  Lord  Krishna
specifically introduces the  inherent  qualifications  of  the  Brahmins  as
ordained by  Vedic  scriptures  along  with  the  natural  duties  that  are
established upon the differentiated degrees of goodness that one  possesses.
This applies to <i>raja</i> and <i>tama gunas</i> as well according to <i>varnasrama</i>  or  the
status and stage of lfe in which one is situated, In order to  to  establish
that the prescribed Vedic activities enjoined in the  Vedic  scriptures  are
by nature dominated by <i>sattva guna</i> if performed without self motivation  for
the exclusive satisfaction of the Supreme Lord  then  as  such  they  confer
tranquillity, wisdom and devotion which all lead to <i>moksa</i>  and  heralds  the
imminent attainment of communion with the Supreme Lord.
<p>
The Brahmins the priestly class, the <i>ksatriyas</i> or royal  warrior  class  and
the <i>vaisya's</i> the mercantile and agricultural class  are  all  spoken  of  in
unison because they only have the right to initiation making them  qualified
to  study  the  Vedic  scriptrures,  engage   in   <i>yagnas</i>   or   ritualistic
propitiation and worship. Whereas the <i>sudra</i> or servant class  are  mentioned
separately as they have not the qualification for initiation  and  study  of
the Vedic scriptures but all are factually the product of their  own  innate
natures.
<p>
To study  the  Vedic  scriptures  and  perform  <i>yagna</i>  the  prerequisite  of
initiation essential and required. A <i>sudra</i> is a  fourth  class  citizen  who
may perform unauthorised activities without sin because they are  only  once
born from the womb not twice born by the spiritual master. It is  prohibited
in the Vedic scripture to initiate a <i>sudra.</i> If done it will  bring  calamity
upon the spiritual master, his dynasty and  the  whole  kingdom.  There  are
direct  references  in  the  Vedic  scriptures   prohibiting   <i>sudras</i>   from
initiation. Such passages as:  The  <i>sudra</i>  carries  the  dead  body  to  the
cremation ground that is a <i>sudra</i> and if a <i>sudra</i>  hears  a  mantra  his  ears
should be filled with wax, if he recites a mantra his tongue should  be  cut
out and if he memorises a mantra his life should be  taken.  So  it  can  be
understood that in ancient times the prohibitions of a <i>sudra</i>  were  strictly
enforced.
<p>
But examples are cited in Vedic scriptures attesting to the fact that if  it
is discered that a <i>sudra</i> possesses the innate qualities of <i>sattva guna</i>  then
even he can be eligible to receive initiation if this has  been  ascertained
by the bonafide spiritual master.
<p>
There is a famous example in the Javalaopanisad of even  an  outcaste  which
is lower then a <i>sudra</i> humbly begging for initiation at the feet of the  sage
Gautama Rishi who  perfunctionarily  asked  him  who  his  father  was.  The
outcaste boy did not know who his father was and told   Gautama  Rishi  that
he would have to  ask  his  mother  and  come  back.  When  he  returned  he
confessed that his mother had told him that she  had  slept  with  many  men
before he was born and so she could not verify who his father  was.  Yet  as
unsavoury as the story was because the  outcaste  boy  had  told  the  truth
Gautama Rishi was pleased and told him that total honesty is  an  undeniable
virtue of  <i>sattva  guna</i>  thus  qualifying  him  to  receive  initiation  and
immeadiately ordered him to shave his head, take full bath and put on  clean
cloth, whereby Gautama Rishi initiated him. 
<p>
The innate characteristic of the Brahmins is predominance  of  <i>sattva  guna.</i>
That of a <i>ksatriya</i> is a predominance of <i>raja guna</i>  with  some  <i>sattva  guna.</i>
That of a <i>vaisya</i> is an equal portion of <i>raja guna</i> and <i>tama guna</i> and that  of
a <i>sudra</i> is a predominance of <i>tama guna</i> with a little <i>raja guna.</i>
