The statements made in the previous  verse  are  being  justified  with  the
words <i>kasmac na</i> meaning why not  which  refers  to  why  shouldn't  all  the
demigods and exalted sages and perfected beings  bow  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna who is the progenitor of Brahma who is their  creator.  The  Supreme
Lord is the embodiment  of  all  creation,  comprised  of  the  animate  and
inanimate. He is <i>sat</i> the effect and <i>asat</i> the cause and He is <i>tat param</i>  that
which is beyond both. He is beyond the <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings united  with
primordial matter which is characterised as what is  existent  and  what  is
non-existent. He  is  beyond  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum  pervading
physical existence. He is beyond the <i>brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum
pervading  all  existence.  He  and   His   energies   are   indestructible,
imperishable and eternal. His plenary expansion within all  sentient  beings
is the <i>atma</i> or soul which is also  indestructible  and  eternal.  The  Katha
Upanisad I.II.XVIII beginning  <i>najayate  mriyateva  vipaschit</i>  meaning:  The
soul is never born neither does it ever die.  As  all  sentient  beings  are
blessed with an eternal soul bestowed by  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  alone  why
should they not all bow down to Him.
