After  the  <i>yogi</i>  or  one  perfecting  the   science   of   the   individual
consciousness with the ultimate consciousness has withdrawn  the  mind  from
sense objects and secured it in the <i>atma;</i> then  the  mind  becoming  utterly
serene achieves the supreme bliss that is sublime as  a  matter  of  course.
Lord Krishna speaks of two alternatives: one is <i>santa-rajasam</i> or  free  from
passion and the second is <i>akalmasam</i> or free from the blemishes of desire  in
other words sinless. Such a person is  <i>brahma-bhutam</i>  or  endowed  with  the
realisation of  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence.
