Lord Krishna declares that one who is  unable  to  control  their  mind  and
senses cannot be in possession of determinate reason. This  is  because  any
one of the rambling senses which the mind attaches itself to in  pursuit  of
sense objects has the power to deviate one, taking away  even  their  common
sense and compelling them to be oblivious to their  highest  good  which  is
realisation of the soul. The example given of an unfavourable wind  forcibly
propelling astray a boat in the water,  completely  deviating  it  from  its
destination is quite apropos.
