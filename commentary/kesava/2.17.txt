In this verse the Supreme Lord Krishna emphasizes  the  conclusive  position
of the soul with the word  avyayasya meaning indestructible. How this is  to
be understood is given by the word yena  meaning  by  which  indicating  the
difference between the soul and the physical body which the  soul  pervades.
This pervasiveness  is  so  extremely  subtle  that  it  is  impossible  for
anything to cause the  destruction  of  its  indestructible  nature  because
whatever would be attempting to destroy it is also  completely  pervaded  by
it as well.
