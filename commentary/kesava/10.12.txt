Now it is being confirmed by Arjuna that all Lord Krishna states as well  as
all that the  great  sages  have  stated  about  Him  is  100%  correct  and
absolutely true. He addresses Lord Krishna as <i>Bhagavan</i> meaning the  complete
possessor of total power, total wisdom, total beauty,  total  wealth,  total
fame and total renunciation. He also asserts that neither the  servitors  of
righteousness the demigods nor the opponents  to  righteousness  the  demons
both of limited  understanding  are  able  to  know  the  Supreme  Lord  who
performs His phenomenal pastimes as though they are sport.
