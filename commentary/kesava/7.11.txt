Lord Krishna continues explaining  His  subtle  qualities  that  He  is  the
strength of the mighty performing their individual duties devoid of  passion
and attachment. He is the energy of sexual desire for procreation  which  is
not contrary to virtue and righteousness and does  not   conflict  with  the
injunctions and  prohibitions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures.  Passion  is  the
unabated craving to get a not yet obtained object with the thought to  enjoy
it.  Attachment  is  the  mental  conditioning  which  after  obtaining  and
enjoying an object makes one cling to the conception  that  such  an  object
must always remain and continued to be enjoyed.
