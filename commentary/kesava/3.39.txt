Here Lord Krishna illustrates the inimical nature of  kama  or
lust with three lucid examples concluding that  discriminatory
knowledge of even basic right and wrong and even common  sense
is completely neutralised by the influence of kama causing one
to act in base and degraded  ways.  The  ignorant  though  are
always  pursuing  kama  because  they  derive  pleasure  while
enjoying the sense objects afterwards when they feel the  pain
of the reaction they are forced to accept they may see kama as
an enemy. The person situated in Vedic wisdom sees kama as  an
enemy from the beginning even while contemplating enjoying the
action and later if they actually consumate  the  action  then
they know a painful reaction is forthcoming. Thus for those of
Vedic wisdom kama is known as being an eternal enemy.
