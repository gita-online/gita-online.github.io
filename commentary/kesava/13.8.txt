Lord Krishna defines the qualities of <i>Parabrahman</i> the Supreme  Lord  as  the
source of the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence
beginning with <i>sarvatah pani padam</i> meaning with hands and  feet  everywhere.
The Svetasvatara Upanisad III.IX states: Without feet or hands He  is  swift
and seizes. He sees  without  eyes  and  hears  without  the  ears.  Without
material organs the Supreme Lord sees on all  sides  and  hears  all  things
within and without and grasps from all directions. The  Supreme  Lord  being
of  transcendental  nature  endowed  with  supra-extraordinary  potency   is
performing all actions of coming, going, grasping, seizing, hearing,  seeing
although without hands and  eyes  and  ears  and  feet,  etc.  The  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being who realises <i>atma-tattva</i> or the reality  of  their  soul  and
achieves <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence, they  will  ultimately
attain the association of the Supreme Lord  and  experience  this  state  as
well. The Mundaka Upanisad III.I.III states: When an aspirant perceives  the
source of the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence  as
the brilliantly effulgent Supreme Lord, then realising  the  ultimate  truth
such a one becomes pristine and pure casting off all dualities such as  what
is good and what is evil and attains  direct  communion  with  the  Ultimate
Consciousness and the Supreme Lord. Hence all  those  liberated  beings  who
have attained such communion to the  Supreme  Lord  are  also  known  to  be
performing actions like Him irrespective of whether or  not  they  have  the
actual material organs. Through the auspices of the  <i>atma</i>  or  immotal  soul
and the <i>brahman</i> the <i>Parabrahman</i> pervades with knowledge all objects  of  the
<i>ksetra-jna.</i> When ignorance has been completely  removed  and  nescience  has
been transcended the unlimited aspect of the <i>atma</i> becomes manifest  and  the
quality of knowledge becomes unlimited and the soul becomes endowed with  an
all pervasive quality of omniscience including past and  future.  Only  then
is the <i>atma</i> spoken of as being equated to <i>Parabrahman;</i> otherwise it  is  not
possible. The same is declared by Vedavyasa in his treatise  Vedanta  Sutras
II.III.XXVIII beginning <i>yavadatam  bhavitva ca</i> meaning: Proof that the  <i>atma</i>
is the consciousness factor is that cognition is only  present  as  long  as
the <i>atma</i> is present; before  self  realisation  it  is  obscured  and  after
enlightenment it is perceived.
