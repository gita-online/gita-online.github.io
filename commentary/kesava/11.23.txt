<p><div align=justify>Arjuna is confessing to Lord Krishna that he is totally distraught  and  his
equilibrium is completely unbalanced  by  the  sight  of  the  <i>visvarupa</i>  or
divine universal form which is <i>nabah-sprsam</i>  meaning  pervading  the  entire
firmament. Seeing such a form radiant and  scorching  in  many  colors  with
flaming  eyes  and  open  mouths  with   horrible   teeth   a   feeling   of
uncontrollable  fright  overcame  him.  The  word  <i>nabah</i>  meaning  firmament
denotes the highest heaven beyond the material  nature.  The  Maha  Narayana
Upanisad I.II  beginning  <i>tad  akshare  parame  vyoma</i>  states:  The  Supreme
controller of all resides in the highest  imperishable  heaven.  Because  it
is the spiritual abode of  the  Supreme  Lord  whose  power  is  primordial,
eternal  and  absolute  it  is  transcendental  to  <i>prakriti</i>  the   material
substratum  pervading  physical   existence   and   not   subject   to   the
modifications of the material creation.
