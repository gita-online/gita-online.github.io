After having explained the  position  of  the  lowly  and  unfortuante  Lord
Krishna follows the line of thought of how much more assured is the  supreme
destination attainable by the higher members of society  like  the  Brahmins
and Vaisnavas who are noble  and  righteous.  If  those  of  low  birth  and
demerits can attain the supreme destination then how much more can those  of
high birth and much merit including the royal sages who are the best of  the
<i>ksatriyas</i> or warrior class as well  as  the  seekers  of  truth.  This  goes
without  question.  Therefore  it  has   been   clearly   and   irrrefutably
established that <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion to Lord Krishna is only means  to
rehabilitate a fallen human being and the only absolute  way  to  accomplish
the attainment of the supreme destination of the  eternal  spiritual  worlds
in association with  the  Supreme  Lord.  Until  having  attained  this  the
spiritually  intelligent  should  renounce  all  temporary   and   transient
illusions of happiness in this <i>asukham</i> or miserable world we  live  in.  Why
is this world miserable? It is because  we  are  bound  to  the  three  fold
miseries of old age, disease and death. The only escape from this misery  is
taking complete refuge of Lord Krishna under the guidance  of  the  bonafide
spiritual preceptor  from one of the four authorised channels  of  disciplic
succession as revealed in Vedic  scriptures.  Worshipping  and  propitiating
only Him each and  everyday  of  one's  life  and  succeed  to  the  Supreme
destination without hindrance. Otherwise the blessing of  birth  in  a  high
family, meritorious deeds, education etc. serve  absolutely  no  purpose  if
they are not used in the loving service of the Supreme Lord.
