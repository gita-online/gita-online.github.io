If it is practically impossible for one to achieve <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from
material existence and attain the eternal spiritual worlds  of  the  Supreme
Lord. How is it realistic to aspire  for  it?  To  answer  this  query  Lord
Krishna declares to exclusively seek refuge in the Supreme  Lord  alone  and
nothing else. The Supreme Lord is the  creator,  protector,  maintainer  and
sustainer of all. He compassionately revealed Srimad Bhagavad-Gita  for  the
benefit of all living entities. Lord Krishna is  extremely  affectionate  to
His devotees. Out of His great magnamity and affection He even accepted  the
position as chariot  driver  for  His  dear  devotee.  By  adhering  to  His
dictates as given in  the  Vedic  scriptures  and  devotedly  following  His
instructions one achieves assured success in life and  attains  unparalleled
bliss in communion with Him in the eernal spiritual worlds which are  beyond
time, death and all material designations.
