Therfore those that only eat food that  has  been  offered  in
yagna or worship are faultless and no other. This Lord Krishna
is  confirming  with  the  word  santah  meaning  saintly  and
virtuous. Those who perform yagna become absolved of all  sins
produced from the daily use of the five utensils in  the  home
used by householders in the cooking and  preparing  of  foods.
Such  sins  are  produced  from  the  non-performance  of  the
injunction of yagna and from the performance of the prohibited
action. These are serious hindrances in attaining heaven.  The
five acts if piety performed by the twice  born  brahmins  are
mandatory,  beginning  with  Brahma  Yagna  or  Vedic   study,
offering worship to God, homage to the anscestors, feeding  of
animals and welcoming and feeding chance  guests.  These  five
acts of piety neutralise all sins contracted by the five areas
of destuction in the home being the  pestle,  the  grindstone,
the fireplace, the waterpot and the broom. Manu  Samhita  III.
69-71 confirms all sins  from  these  five  actions  are  duly
nullified by the five previous acts of piety.
