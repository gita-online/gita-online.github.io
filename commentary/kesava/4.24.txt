Lord Krishna explains that all the actions of  such  a  <i>yogi</i>  or  one  whose
individual consciousness is in communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness
are dissolved but how is this  possible?  It  is  because  such  a  <i>yogi</i>  is
established in the knowledge of the <i>atma</i> or soul  with  full  cognisance  of
every action  being  a  <i>yagna</i>  or  offering  to  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. As everything in existence is  factually
within the <i>Brahman</i> it can be understood that everything is actually  a  form
of the <i>Brahman.</i> The <i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  of  reality  is  surely
the destination to be achieved by those who are experiencing  it, as  verily
it is eternal and permanent. This is in contrast to one  being  absorbed  in
obtaining the enjoyments of  heaven  which  are  temporary  and  transitory.
Concentration in the <i>Brahman</i> is considered as <i>yagna</i> or propitiation  to  the
ultimate reality.
