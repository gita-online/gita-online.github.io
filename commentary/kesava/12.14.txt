One who neither rejoices upon receiving something  delightful  nor  despairs
in  receiving  something  that  is  not  a  delight,  no  laments  when  the
delightful object  is  lost,  nor  desires  to  possess  it  again  and  who
renounces both positive and negative actions which  bind  one  to  <i>karma</i>  or
reactions to  actions  with  positive  and  negative  consequenses;  such  a
devotee of Lord Krishna is very dear to Him.
