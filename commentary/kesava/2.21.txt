As to remove   any  doubts  concerning  the  Vedic  injunction  against  the
killing  of  cows  and  the  killing  of  a  brahmana  such  as  Drona,  the
perpetrators of these heinious crimes go directly to hell to suffer  at  the
termination of their material  existence.  To  mitigate  this  Lord  Krishna
tells Arjuna that one who knows the  soul  to  be  indestructible  and  thus
eternal as well as  unborn  and  unmodifiable  although  uniquely  different
within every body knows that no one in anyway can cause the  destruction  of
the soul. Who is the doer in the action of killing? Whom can  one  cause  to
be killed? Can one be the agent in the death of the soul? The answer  is  no
to all and it is indicated that there should be no doubt about the  veracity
of the Vedic scriptures regarding the sin incurred either  when  one  causes
another to be killed or when one is directed to kill another.  By  this  the
Vedic injunctions prohibiting cow slaughter and  the  slaying  of  brahmanas
and the great sin attached thereof must be accepted as fact even though  one
is in knowledge about the factual nature  of  the  eternal  reality  of  the
souls immortality.
