If one is unable to  practice  detachment  by  themselves  then  one  should
mentally dedicate all actions to the Supreme Lord entrusting them to Him  as
the doer and offer all prescribed Vedic activities as well  as  all  worldly
activities in  renunciation.  This  includes  surrendering  all  ordinances,
injunctions and prohibitions as well as one's  daily  mundane  duties  along
with the resultant hopes, aspirations and rewards unto the Supreme Lord  who
becomes the only goal. One who after due reflection makes this  resolve  has
perceived that Lord Krishna is the supreme reality to attain.
