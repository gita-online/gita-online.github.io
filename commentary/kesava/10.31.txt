Among the sounds of speech from the various letters of  all  languages  Lord
Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine,  transcendental  opulence   is   the   sound
represented by the first letter of the alphabet known as A. Among  different
types of compounds in grammar His <i>vibhuti</i> is the dual  compound  whose  both
parts are complimentary yet independent. Among subjugators  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  is
all subjugating time terminating all existence in the form of Shiva  at  the
time of universal destruction and of creators His <i>vibhuti</i> is  <i>visvato-mukhah</i>
the four- headed Brahma. The Svetara Upanisad VI.XVI states: He who  is  the
knower and devourer of time the omniscient  one  possessing  all  auspicious
attributes etc. In the Udyoga Parva of Mahabharta it  states:  Lord  Krishna
incessantly revolves the wheel of time, the wheel  of  the  worlds  and  the
wheel of all dimensions by His <i>vibhuti.</i> The Supreme Lord Krishna rules  over
all time, all death and all that is moving and non-moving. This  is  eternal
truth.
