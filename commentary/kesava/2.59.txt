Thus the control over the senses is root cause of stabilising the mind.  Now
Lord Krishna reveals  the  flaws  in  not  possessing  a  stable  mind.  One
situated  in  spiritual  intelligence  with  discrimination  and  powers  of
observation trying their level  best  to  keep  the  mind  from  gravitating
towards the senses and withdrawing their mind repeatedly away  from  objects
of the senses and directing it internally within is a  form  of  meditation.
But the senses are so strong that they forcibly  invade  the  mind,  disrupt
this  meditation  and  forcibly  overpower  the  mind  and  indulge  it   in
contemplating sense gratification and bodily attachment. How is it  possible
that the senses can carry away ones mind while they are  intently  striving?
It is because the senses are so restless and  turbulent  that  they  totally
disregarding all ones efforts in discrimination,  besieging  the  mind  they
direct it towards sensual objects that will gratify these  self-same  senses
by engaging the mind in sense contemplation.
