Having instructed the  true  knowledge  of  the  soul  as  being  distinctly
different from the physical body and seeing that this  knowledge  has  still
not been firmly embedded in Arjunas  heart,  Lord  Krishna  reiterates  this
truth again in order to illustrate that this knowledge never becomes  firmly
embedded without practice of  the  means  which  is  yoga.  To  do  this  He
introduces the yoga path of selfless actions as the means to this end.  Thus
the reality is to perform all actions under the direction of ones mind  well
cultivated by the aid of  spiritual  knowledge  from  the  Vedic  scriptures
exclusively. Although this  spiritual  knowledge  is  scientific  Arjuna  is
still unsteady in its application due to lack of practice  in  assimilation.
So Lord Krishna explains that by practice in the performance of  actions  by
the renunciation of their rewards  Arjuna  will  be  completely  freed  from
transmigration in the material existence.
