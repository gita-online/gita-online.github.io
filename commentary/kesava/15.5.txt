Lord Krishna briefly explains  some  characteristics  of  that  imperishable
Supreme state, His eternal abode. There the light of the sun or the moon  or
fire is not necessary because His eternal  abode  is  self-illuminating  and
self-effulgent without any association with material  existence  and  always
beyond the darkness of nescience. This  is  confirmed  in  the  Svetasvatara
Upanisad III.VIII beginning:  <i>veda  hametam  purusam</i>  meaning:  The  Supreme
Lord, more resplendent then the sun, illuminates  all  within  and  without,
only by realising Him is a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being able to transcend  <i>samsara</i>
the perpetual cycle of birth and death, there is no other  possibility.  The
usage of the word <i>mama</i> meaning my dispels any  illusions  of  seperation  or
seperate identity of His abode. It is not an independent entity  nor  is  it
non-different from Him. The Supreme Lord's eternal abode  is  a  portion  of
His divine potency.
