This is the final chapter of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita  and  in  it  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna gives a concise synopsis of all the subjects presented  in  the
previous 17 chapters. This He does in order to  impress  upon  our  memories
the topics  elaborated  upon  earlier  and  to  clearly  delineate  how  all
conceptions harmoniously unite in  the  marvellous  sublime  beauty  of  the
final conclusion. At the end of the  last  chapter  it  was  explained  that
actions were  only  declared  righteous  if  they  were  performed  for  the
exclusive satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His  authorised
incarnations  revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures.  Such   actions   exclusively
dedicated in chapter 17, verse 27 for His satisfaction alone  are  known  as
SAT and clearly denote that  the  desire  for  rewards  is  what  is  to  be
abandoned and not the activity. This was also confirmed earlier  in  chapter
12, verse 11 where Lord  Krishna  advises  that  controlling  the  mind  one
should relinquish the desire for the rewards of  actions.  Even  earlier  in
chapter 5, verse  13  Lord  Krishna  had  advised  mentally  renouncing  all
actions.
<p>
Why then do these two  instructions  seem  contradictory  and  what  is  the
correct understanding regarding the renunciation  of  all  actions  and  the
renunciation of desire for the receiving the rewards of  actions?  The  true
nature of abandonment of actions and  the  abandonment  of  the  desire  for
rewards and the distinction between  the  two  is  what  Lord  Krishna  will
address. In this context it must be taken into consideration whether or  not
<i>sannyasa</i> or renunciation and <i>tyaja</i> or abandonment  are  actually  different.
The Mundaka Upanisad III.II.VI beginning <i>veda tat vijnano  sunisch</i>  meaning:
Those  who  have  purified  themselves   through   renunciation   and   have
ascertained and comprehended the Vedic  scriptures  will  achieve  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence. Neither  through  actions,  nor  wealth,
nor progeny but only by renunciation is immortality gained.
<p>
The  evocatives  <i>mahabaho</i>  meaning  mighty  armed  denotes  Lord   Krishna's
indomitable might and <i>kesinisudana</i> refers to His destroying a mighty  demon.
So He is requested to by His supreme power to destroy  the  misunderstanding
of renunciation along with destroying the enemies on  the  battlefield.  The
evocative <i>Hrsikesa</i> acknowledges that Lord Krishna is the  inner  monitor  of
the mind and that only He can remove all doubts.
