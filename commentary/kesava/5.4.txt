How renunciation can apply to the <i>yogi</i> or the follower  of  the  science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness who is performing <i>karma yoga</i> or  prescribed  Vedic  activities
is being  clarified  here  by  Lord  Krishna.  The  ignorant  and  uniformed
mistakenly see these two paths as separate yielding divergent  results;  but
this is not accepted by those who are self-realised  as  it  has  been  seen
that a person  who  determinedly  follows  either  path  achieves  the  same
result.
