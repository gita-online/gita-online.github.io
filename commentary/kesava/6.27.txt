Now Lord Krishna speaks of the most exalted <i>yogi's</i> who perceiving  the  <i>atma</i>
in all created beings view them as non-different from  himself.  Just  as  a
person does not like to create difficulties for themselves and at all  times
wishes the best for themselves. In the same way such a <i>yogi</i>  does  not  want
difficulties created for any being and at all times wishes the best for  all
beings. Such a <i>yogi</i> is completely free from passion and desire  and  is  the
most exalted of all <i>yogi's.</i> All persons due to their  previous  actions  are
caught in the current of  reactions  of  merits  and  demerits  that  create
obstacles  in  achieving  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord.  Those  whose
knowledge is veiled by nescience birth after  birth  since  time  immemorial
have no idea that the highest goal of human existence is first  <i>atma  tattva</i>
or realisation  of  the  soul  within  the  etheric  heart  and  second  the
perception of the <i>atma</i> or soul in all created beings and the ultimate  unity
of all created beings. This unity is absolute  inseparable  unity  with  the
Supreme Lord.

By chance a fortunate individual receives the  unconditional  mercy  of  the
Supreme Lord, reflects on the purpose of human  existence  and  gaining  the
association of pious people comes into contact with  a  qualified  spiritual
preceptor and following their instructions  concerning  realisation  of  the
<i>atma</i> and the path to <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the  material  existence  they
purify their mind and very existence. Then such a person engages  themselves
wholeheartedly  in  the  practice  of  meditation  which   culminates   into
realisation of the embodied self being the <i>atma</i> or soul  and  <i>paramatma</i>  the
Supreme Soul both residing within the etheric heart. From this time  on  one
only experiences  the  actions  dictated  by  destiny  and  until  all  past
accumulated reactions are finished. One comprehends that both happiness  and
unhappiness are temporary and  caused  by  merits  and  demerits  from  past
actions and present obstacles on the path to  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  to  the
Supreme Lord. Just as those fettered in golden chains  or  iron  chains  are
both in bondage and each feel the same type  of  relief  when  released  and
freed. So in the same way the pleasure one receives  causing  obstacles  due
to merits and the pain one receives causing obstacles due to  demerits  both
have the same effect of relief when they are finally exhausted and a  person
is set free by achieving <i>moksa.</i> This  mentality  one  applies  also  to  all
created beings because one sees everything with the  same  equal  vision  as
one perceives themselves.
