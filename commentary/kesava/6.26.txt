Lord Krishna declares even higher states for the  established  <i>yogi</i>  or  one
perfecting the science of the individual consciousness  attaining  communion
with the ultimate consciousness. The <i>yogi</i> who  perceives  the  Supreme  Lord
existing in all beings as well as his very self is  certainly  advanced  but
here Lord Krishna is stating that the one who worships Him as <i>paramatma</i>  the
indwelling supreme soul within all living entities is  even  more  superior.
In the Vishnu Purana it  states:  O  Lord  it  is  Your  nature  only  which
indicates Your Supreme power of encompassing all living beings  in  creation
and because You are omni-present, You are infinite  and  upon  reaching  you
the liberated beings also assume these qualities. The <i>yogi</i> although  engaged
in all forms of activities  like  eating,  teaching,  traveling,  meditating
still achieves similar  nature  to  the  Supreme  Lord  due  to  inseparable
communion with Him at all times in all situations.
