Lord Krishna has now ended descriptions of the basic details of  the  nature
and characteristics of the demoniac. Now He strongly advises  by  any  means
to avoid the triple threat of lust, greed and anger which is the  underlying
root cause of all demoniac vices and evils.  As  soon  as  lust,  greed  and
anger are abandoned all other vices and evils dissolve and dissapate.  Birth
in hellish existences has three doors in the form of the door of  lust,  the
door of greed and the door of anger. As soon as anyone enters into  any  one
of these three doors they become  void  of  discrimination  and  their  mind
becomes apprehended and controlled  by  the  senses.  This  causes  complete
chaos and utter ruin to any human being, blocking  access  to  their  higher
nature and totally obscuring the consciousness of the <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul
which leads to <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material  existence.  The  three
doorways of lust, greed and anger causes one  to  perform  such  sinful  and
abominable activities that damnation is the only result and  leads  a  human
being directly to hell to suffer  immensely  for  their  sinful  inequities.
Hence one should be extremely vigilant to avoid these three doors  and  keep
them far away at a safe distance.
