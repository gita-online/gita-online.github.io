One who performs the natural prescribed duties  as  ordained  by  the  Vedic
scriptures according to qualification accomplihes the four  goals  of  human
existence  which  are:  <i>kama</i>  or  enjoyment,  <i>artha</i>  or  wealth,  <i>dharma</i>  or
ighteousness and <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material  existence.  By  devotion
and wholehearted commitment to performing one's natural  duty  the   highest
perfection is achieved in the form of self-realisation. It may be  submitted
that so many perform their duties perfectly and yet  still  do  not  achieve
the highest perfection, this is seen to be true.  But  the  reason  for  not
achieving self-realisation is that they have not yet developed  devotion  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna wholeheartedly. That is why  success  eluded  them.
So this is how the natural duties of a human should be conducted.
