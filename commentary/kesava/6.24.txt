Now Lord Krishna presents the four-fold divisions of the subsequent  results
of such a firmly established <i>yogi</i> or one perfected in  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness. Such a very advanced being has become united  with  the  <i>atma</i>
or soul thus perceiving the <i>atma</i> in  all  beings  of  multifarious,  diverse
natures and variegated  physical and subtle bodies. This  applies  from  the
highest demigod known as Brahma down to an inanimate tree. How  is  it  that
such a <i>yogi</i> can perceive his <i>atma</i> existing in  all  beings  and  all  beings
existing in his <i>atma.</i>  The  words  <i>yoga-yuktatma</i>  meaning  united  with  the
nature of the <i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence,
one sees all things with equal vision, without any distinction between  them
knowing that all forms  are  veritable  products  of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  material
nature. The purport is  such  a  <i>yogi</i>  sees  all  forms,  even  his  own  as
manifestation of  the  <i>Brahman</i>    and  therefore  there  is  no  distinctive
difference  in his <i>atma</i> and the <i>atma</i> of others.  The  <i>atma</i>  is  eternal  and
pure and distinctly different from the physical body. So firmly adhering  to
self-realisation such a <i>yogi</i> becomes enlightened in all respects.  Yet  even
the physical bodies are equal as well as they all  manifest  from  the  same
primordial matter and all have a beginning and an end. So in this way  there
is no contradiction if the <i>yogi</i> perceives his <i>atma</i> existing  in  all  beings
and all beings existing in his <i>atma.</i>
