Lord Krishna is addressed in the vocative with the  words  <i>kamala-patra-aksa</i>
meaning whose eyes are large and  beautiful  like  the  petals  of  a  lotus
flower and denotes His qualities of sweetness and softness of form  as  well
as the repository of charm and beauty in look. The reality  of  His  <i>vibhuti</i>
or divine, transcendental opulence has been understood as well as His  being
the source of creation and dissolution for  all  beings  in  all  existence.
Although Lord Krishna is the doer of all He is  the  non-doer  as  well  for
these things manifest automatically from Him. Although He is the  controller
of all, He is impartial. Although He is present within all He  is  untainted
by their imperfections. Although  He  directs  all  according  to  <i>karma</i>  or
reactions from righteous or unrighteous actions He is not  unfair.  Although
He bestows the results of everyone's righteous or unrighteous actions He  is
not cruel. He is equal to all though He bequeaths various  results  such  as
<i>moksa</i> or liberation, <i>baddha</i> or bondage, etc. He is equal to all. He  is  the
absolute controller of primordial matter, time consisting of  past,  present
and future,  the  object  of  adoration  for  all  beings,  unassailable  by
everyone, unconquerable by anyone, whose will is indomitable, unable  to  be
transgressed  and  who  has  the  compassionate  nature  of  destroying  the
impediments and obstacles of His devotees. Such infinite greatness has  been
understood and assimilated by Arjuna.
