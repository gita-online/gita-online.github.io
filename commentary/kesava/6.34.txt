Lord Krishna  is  being  requested  to  dispel  all  doubts  concerning  the
destination of one who does not succeed in their life in perfecting <i>yoga</i>  or
the science of the individual consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness. All embodied beings are  perishable  and  devoid  of
omniscience so as the omniscient Supreme Lord and most  affectionate  friend
it would behove Him to completely clear up this question.
