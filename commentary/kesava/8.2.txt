What is <i>adhiyagna</i> that is entitled for propitiation  and  to  whom  is  this
propitiation offered? Who is the specific god? Who is the receiver  of  this
<i>yagna</i> or propitiation offered in worship? Is it Indra the chief of  all  the
demigods or is it to the Supreme Lord? If the Supreme Lord is  the  receiver
then is <i>yagna</i> offerred to Him internally residing inside the  physical  body
or is it offered externally to His manifestation outside the physical  body?
If the <i>yagna</i> is offered internally then in what way does  the  Supreme  Lord
accept the offering? Finally it is asked how and in what way is the  Supreme
Lord Krishna to be realised at the time  of  death  of  the  physical  body?
Arjuna addresses  Lord  Krishna  in  the  vocative  case  using  the  anonym
<i>Madhusudana,</i> the killer of the Madhu demon. The  purport  of  this  is  that
just as it is easy for Lord Krishna to terminate demons,  it  is  also  easy
for Him to terminate the doubts in Arjuna's mind concerning these subjects.
