After pointing out the defects of performing optional activities  which  are
not essential, Lord Krishna extols the virtues  of  equanimity  in  that  it
neutralises all reactions  without  a  doubt  both  positive  and  negative.
Therefore  everyone  should  make  a  diligent  endeavour  to  achieve  this
consciousness of equanimity. For one expertly engaged in  actions  which  do
not incur reactions on their path to attain  liberation  form  the  material
existence and the ultimate truth is the highest skill.
