I humbly bow down to the Supreme Lord Krishna, the  ultimate  controller  of
all creation, who is only  accessible  through  <i>bhakti</i>  or  loving  devotion
which is the highest of the highest, who by His causeless mercy is also  the
bestower of such <i>bhakti</i> to whom He chooses and who dispels the  darkness  of
ignorance known as <i>maya</i> or the delusion of illusion.
<p>
The first six chapters of Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  known  as  the  <i>karma  yoga</i>
section were revealed for the aspirants of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  the
material existence to establish that the highest  and  most  profound  human
goal is to attain communion with the Supreme  Lord  by  realisation  of  the
embodied <i>atma</i> or soul. <i>Atma tattva</i> or the knowledge of the soul  was  stated
as paramount and the means of achieving <i>moksa</i> along with  selfless  actions,
equanimity, detachment, meditation and as parts of <i>yoga</i> or  the  science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness. Now in the next six chapters is being revealed how <i>bhakti</i>  or
loving devotion is the only means to  accomplishing  the  ultimate  goal  of
communion with the Supreme Lord.
<p>
Now in order to describe the path of devotion to the  Supreme  Lord  and  to
confirm that He is the highest reality and ultimate  attainment,  possessing
eternal divine attributes such as omniscience, omnipresence and  omnipotence
and to establish that the  Supreme  Lord  is  the  ultimate  goal  and  sole
recipient worthy of devotion. Also to describe different kinds  of  devotees
of <i>bhakti</i> to the Supreme Lord and their  antagonists  the  non-devotees  and
the non-believers in God and the Vedic scriptures, the middle  six  chapters
from seven to twelve known as the <i>karma yoga</i> section are being revealed.
<p>
In the beginning of chapter seven the  description  of  the  nature  of  the
object of devotion is given along with the nature of the  devotees.  At  the
conclusion of chapter six, verse forty-seven Lord Krishna declared that  one
who devotedly worships Him exclusively with their mind  focused  on  him  is
considered to be the best amongst all <i>yogis</i> or those engaged  in  perfecting
the science of the individual consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness. The question one might ask is what  is  the  way  to
know the Supreme Lord and how should one fix the mind on Him and how  should
a devotee humbly offer  Him  worship?  Although  these  questions  were  not
raised by Arjuna; yet without being asked Lord  Krishna  out  of  compassion
spoke the word <i>chrnu</i> meaning listen and then He spoke the words  <i>mad-asrayah</i>
meaning with your mind focused on Me.
<p>
The Supreme Lord Krishna possessing solely transcendental qualities such  as
eternity, consciousness and bliss and although appearing in  human  form  is
completely beyond the sway of material nature while at the same  time  being
the  source  of  infinite  auspicious  attributes  such  as  compassion  and
majesty. One should concentrate their minds  on  the  Supreme  Lord  of  all
other lords and worship Him with love and devotion and not like  any  lesser
god for trivial material gains.  Then  the  Supreme  Lord  of  all  will  be
revealed within  the  etheric  heart  of  one  so  surrendered  in  all  His
splendour, power and glory without fail.
