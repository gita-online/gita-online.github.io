How is this verse to be understood? For one who is born  death  is  certain.
This is because of the reality of a  fixed  time  limit  in  regard  to  the
continuation of actions relating to the   coming  into  existence  of  one's
physical body as well as the longevity of one's present  physical body.  The
fact that this reality is inevitable is due  to  the  nature  of  activities
performed in one's previous existence which causes one  to  be  continuously
connected to the cycle of birth and death in the present body. Therefore  it
does not behoove one to grieve over the unavoidable regarding  the  physical
body which is dependant on actions.
