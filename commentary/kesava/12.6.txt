The Supreme Lord Krishna Himself is the savior of His  surrendered  devotees
who exclusively perform <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion to Him.  He  rescues  them
from <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of birth  and  death  devouring  all  in
material existence and bestows upon them His own nature  of  endless  bliss.
Here Lord Krishna is instructing Arjuna  to  act  as  His  devotees  do.  By
focusing His mind on the Supreme Lord alone, which is  the  most  auspicious
abode for the mind, He is adored and beloved by His devotees  and  the  Lord
of all lords. One should establish their intellect  decisively  and  resolve
in their mind that the Supreme Lord  Krishna  is  the  paramount  object  of
worship and the ultimate goal to be attained. With the  mind  and  intellect
absorbed in the Supreme Lord one  will  certainly  abide  with  Him  in  His
eternal spiritual abode at the end of  this  flickering  physical  existence
along  with  countless  others  of  similar  determination  and  sharing  in
communion with Him will not be separated  from the Supreme Lord ever again.
