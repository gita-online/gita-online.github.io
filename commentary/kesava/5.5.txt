The same result stated in the previous verse is <i>atma tattva</i>  or  realisation
of the soul. This is achieved by both the follower  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  the
performers of prescribed Vedic activities without attachment to the  rewards
as well as the follower who performs renunciation of actions to the  Supreme
Lord both attain the result of <i>atma tattva</i>. Thus one  who  sees  by  careful
analysis that because both paths yield the same fruit they are actually  the
same is situated in true knowledge.
