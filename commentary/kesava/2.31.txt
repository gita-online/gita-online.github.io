Having established the fact that it is not intelligent to lament  about  the
soul of any living entity, Lord Krishna  subsequently  responds  to  Arjunas
supplication of what is in his highest good  with  the  word  svadharmam  or
principles of righteousness. Not only considering the  nature  of  the  soul
but one's duty is indicated here as well. Lord Krishna is  emphasising  this
to Arjuna so that he will follow his duty as  a  ksatriya  and  act  like  a
warrior. For to act contrary and hesitate or  waver  is  not  in  accordance
with ksatriya code according to Vedic scriptures and  such  a  deviation  by
Arjuna would be considered an act of unrighteousness.  What  then  is  duty?
Righteousness is duty which is not separate from those  who  are  righteous.
For a ksatriya there is nothing more welcome then the oppurtunity  to  fight
a battle to protect righteousness. As it is stated in Yagnavalkya  that  the
steps taken in warfare are as sacrifices themselves for  those  who  do  not
turn their backs from battle even though wounded. It  is  to  be  understood
that  Arjunas  previous  lamentations  such  as  feeling  sympathy  for  his
relatives in battle arrayed against him,  his  body  shaking  and  his  hair
standing on end, his mind reeling  and  his  loss  of  equilibrium  are  all
unfavorable to him in executing his duty and thus  are  not  appropriate  in
this situation.
