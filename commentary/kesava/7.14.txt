It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that the flowing of  the  qualities  of
Lord  Krishna's  divine  potency  known  as  <i>maya</i>  or  illusory  impressions
superimposed upon the mind  is  without  a  beginning  or  an  end.  In  the
Svestasvatara Upanisad IV.V it states that by the agency of  <i>maya</i>  unlimited
beings are produced possessing like qualities. So it  is  not  possible  for
those embodied beings deluded and controlled by <i>maya</i>  and  to  ever  receive
divine benedictions and such being the case they will never be  eligible  to
overcome the delusory effects of <i>maya.</i> Lord Krishna speaks thus  to  address
this point of overcoming the potent effects of <i>maya</i> So  marvellous  is  this
wondrous illusion which is perceived in <i>prakriti</i> or the material  substratum
evolving through the three <i>gunas</i> or  the  modes  of  goodness,  passion  and
nescience into physical forms which are all totally controlled by the  Self-
Effulgent, Supreme Lord full of eternity, knowledge and bliss, who  although
omnipresent is never touched or influenced  by  the  <i>gunas</i>  or  <i>prakriti</i>  or
anything animate or inanimate. There is also nothing which a has  a  similar
nature to <i>maya</i> as its function  is  one  of  a  kind.  In  the  Svetasvatara
Upanisad IV.X it states: One should know that <i>maya's</i> nature is illusory  and
that the omniscient and omnipotent Supreme Lord is its source filtered  into
material existence through the three <i>gunas</i> and unable to  be  surmounted  by
hundreds of processes and thousands  of  techniques  unless  and  until  the
grace of the Supreme Lord is  attained.  According  to  the  Katha  Upanisad
V<i>.</i>XIII: He who is the  constant  within  the  inconstant,  the  intelligence
among the intelligent, the one within the many and who grants  all  desires.
In the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad I.IV.X it states: Whoever among  the  demigods
becomes awakened to  this  indeed  becomes  it,  this  applies  likewise  to
elevated beings and also to advanced  humans.   The  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal  soul
within embodied beings is without  limitations  but  among  embodied  beings
only those who are able to disconnect themselves from all ego  sense  of  I-
ness and my-ness and external desires and renouncing all other goals  accept
the Supreme Lord Krishna as the exclusive goal of their life  endeavour  and
spiritual practices. Thus  worshipping  Him  wholeheartedly  as  omnipotent,
omnipresent and omniscient controller of <i>maya</i>, taking total  refuge  in  Him
solely and faithfully following the six activities favourable for  spiritual
advancement such as  enthusiasm,  endeavouring  with  confidence,  patience,
following the Vedic injunctions, abandoning the  association  of  those  not
devoted to the Vedic culture and  accepting and following  the  instructions
of the authorised guru from the bonafide disciplic  succession  as  revealed
within  the  Vedic  scriptures;  one  is  with  devotion   and   unshakeable
perseverance able to overcome this insurmountable  <i>maya.</i>  The  word  <i>eva</i>  or
only is used in the sense of decisiveness as in exclusively. In  the  Vamana
Purana the child saint Prahlad says: Those highly evolved persons  who  have
taken refuge in the Supreme Lord, infinite,  immutable,  without  a  second,
the foremost of all lords, the God  of  Gods,  the  auspicious  bestower  of
liberation, the Lord of Laxsmi, the goddess of fortune  and  the  master  of
Garuda, His carrier never have to be subjected to  chastisement  by  Yamaraj
the demigod in charge of punishment in diverse hells.
