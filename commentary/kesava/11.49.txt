Lord Krishna reveals that it is extremely difficult to see His human two-
armed form and He emphasises this with the words su-durdarsam which means
very rarely seen. The visvarupa or divine universal form is impossible to
be seen without His grace, yet His four armed human form is so rare that
the demigods are always hankering to see it even for a moment; but now Lord
Krishna is revealing that His beautiful two armed human form is the rarest
of all and that it is so seldom revealed the demigods never get the chance
to see it.
