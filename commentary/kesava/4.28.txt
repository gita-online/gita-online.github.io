Here Lord Krishna reveals others who earn money honestly  and  donate  funds
to qualified Vaisnavas and Brahmins to perform <i>yagna</i> or offering of  worship
to propitiate the Supreme Lord. They also offer foodstuffs to feed  all  the
guests at the Supreme Lord's festivals. They bear the  expense  of  building
temples to the Supreme Lord Krishna or His authorised incarnations as  well.
This is known as <i>arthayagna.</i>  Some  perform  austerities  such  as  special
fasting during the time which corresponds from <i>amavasya</i> or the new  moon  to
<i>purnima</i> or the full moon and back again to <i>amavasya</i>.  Others  perform  <i>yagna</i>
by practicing the eight-fold  yoga  system  such  as  <i>yama</i>  or  forbearance,
<i>niyama</i> or restraint, <i>asanas</i> or postures, <i>pranayama</i> or  breathing  exercises,
<i>pratyahara</i> or withdrawal,  <i>dharana</i>  or  focused  attention  and  <i>samadhi</i>  or
complete absorption in meditation. Others strive by observing austere  vows,
others perform <i>yagna</i> by intense study of the Vedic scriptures.
