What is to  be  determined  by  this  verse?  What  should  be
understood  is that in the beginning of creation Lord  Krishna
Himself entered into each  and  every  living  entity  as  the
imperishable atma or soul to monitor   the  evolution  of  all
living beings and to accomplish  the  goals  of  the  freewill
exercised by every individual soul  who  previously  had  been
merged within his internal potency. Thus by  inspiring  Brahma
to project them into  the  material  manifestation  they  were
created into innumerable names and forms and expressions.  The
Brahmins were manifested from the head of the Supreme  Brahman
and thus they were able to perform actions these actions  were
performance of yagna or  worship  and  then  rains,  food  and
living beings arose.  All  human  beings  have  the  right  to
perform spiritual activities according to  qualification;  but
those who instead  choose  to  shun  this  responsibility  and
disrespect all of creation which provides all necessities,  by
not performing yagna has verily disconnected  themselves  from
the  spiritual  reality  that   the   Supreme   Lord   Himself
established for the benefit of all living beings. Thus day  by
day such a living entity is increasing  their  sins  by  being
deluded into thinking they are independent and do not need  to
satisfy the chance guest, the ancestors, the demigods and  the
Supreme Brahman. Thus by daily feeding oneâs body  food  which
was not consecrated by being offered in yagna that unfortunate
person human life is in vain. The purport is that  even  death
is better than living for such a person as this.
