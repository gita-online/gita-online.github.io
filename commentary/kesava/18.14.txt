The five factors being the physical  body,  the  life  airs,  the  ego,  the
senses and the soul are invariably the cause of all  actions.  Lord  Krishna
now specifies that all  actions  performed  by  the  mind,  speech  or  body
whether righteous as prescribed  by  the  Vedic  scriptures  or  unrighteous
which are prohibited in the  Vedic  scriptures  are  caused  by  these  five
factors.
