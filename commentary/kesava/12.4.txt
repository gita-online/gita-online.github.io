It could be  surmised  that  if  the  worshippers  of  the  <i>avyakta</i>  or  the
unmanifest impersonal <i>brahman</i> being the spiritual substratum  pervading  all
creation are  also  able  to  reach  the  Supreme  Lord  then  why  are  the
worshippers of the Supreme Lord considered superior and in what way do  they
differ from the others? Lord Krishna explains that <i>asakta</i> or  attachment  to
seeking <i>brahman</i> gives benefits only with  great  difficulty  and  trail  and
tribulation because it is exceedingly difficult to  imagine  what  to  focus
upon when it can not be perceived by the mind and senses. Also for  one  who
is in the bodily conception of life bewildered by the  ego  and  deluded  by
thinking they are the physical body it is impossible  to  ever  realise  the
<i>brahman</i> or achieve pure devotion to the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul.
