Why is it that billions of humans do  not  recognise  Lord  Krishna  as  the
Supreme Lord and  controller  of  all  and  the  cause  and  source  of  all
creation? And even those who do know about Lord Krishna  being  the  Supreme
Lord of all, how do they still remain a transmigratory soul  every  lifetime
forced to accept a  new  physical  body?  To  answer  these  questions  Lord
Krishna explains: <i>sarvam idam jagat mohitam</i> meaning the entire  creation  is
deluded. This is due to the  influence  of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of
goodness  possessing  discrimination  and  righteousness,  mode  of  passion
possessing pride and desire and the mode  of  ignorance  possessing  inertia
and degradation. These three modes infatuates all  living  entities  causing
their higher consciousness to be veiled and inaccessible.  Thus  it  is  not
possible for billions of human beings as well as other  living  entities  to
recognise  Lord  Krishna's,  imperishable,  paramount  position  above   all
creation.  Although  in  an  impersonal  sense  human  beings  are  able  to
recognise and relate to  portions  of  Lord  Krishna's  power,  majesty  and
superiority by their conceptions of a supreme being or  supreme  controller,
o as a totally independent power; but these  humans  are  unable  to  relate
that these  attrinutes  apply  exclusively  to  Lord  Krishna,  who  is  the
ultimate  reality.  Also  these  humans  are  unable  to  perceive  that  He
manifests and incarnates in the material worlds  in  His  eternal  spiritual
body which is immutable and not subject to  decay  or  modification  and  He
does this for the welfare of His devotees. The conclusion is that all  these
billions of human beings do not recognise Lord Krishna as  He  factually  is
possessed of eternal, transcendental attributes and divine qualities.  Hence
they all are unable to attain His divine potency which enables them to  free
themselves from <i>samsara</i> or the endless cycle of birth  and  death  and  thus
remaining in bondage are reborn again and again indefinitely.
