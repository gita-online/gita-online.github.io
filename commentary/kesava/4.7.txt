So it is accepted that Lord Krishna has no beginning and  is  immutable  and
that He instructed Visvavan the demi-god of the sun millenniums before in  a
past incarnation but a question may arise in  regard  to  the  many  births.
When did all these manifestations take place? Lord Krishna  clears  up  this
point beginning with the words <i>yada  yada</i>  meaning  whenever  and  wherever.
This signifies that anytime or anyplace that a decline in  righteousness  is
apparent, being antagonistic and in opposition to  divinity,  at  that  time
the Supreme Lord  manifests  Himself.  Here  the  word  <i>dharma</i>  which  means
righteousness does not  imply  ordinary  righteousness  as  applies  to  the
mundane interactions of <i>varnasrama</i> or the position and stages in life.  Here
<i>dharma</i> applies to the deterioration of <i>bhakti yoga</i> or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness by the means of loving devotion. When there is  a  decline  in
<i>bhakti yoga</i> and the path of  devotion  to  God  is  opposed  by  unrighteous
rulers who in ignorance are inimical to love of God then at that  time  Lord
Krishna manifests Himself  personally.  Thus  it  is  stated  by  Bhumi  the
goddess of the Earth in the Brahmavaivarta Purana: The Earth  is  unable  to
bear the burden of those greatly sinful persons who are averse  to  devotion
to Lord Krishna and who blaspheme Lord Krishna's devotees. Lord Krishna  has
explained in the Srimad Bhagavatam that when <i>sattva  guna</i>  or  the  mode  of
goodness increases then humans naturally will  proportionately  increase  in
righteousness and devotion to Him. A person living their  life  without  any
devotion to God has wasted there human existence and a person who  does  not
take delight in hearing about the sublime  transcendental  pastimes  of  the
Suprem Lord Krishna which benefits all living entities has lived their  life
in vain.
