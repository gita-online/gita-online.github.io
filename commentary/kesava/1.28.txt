Here Arjuna exclaims that he cannot foresee any  benefit  from  slaying  his
own kinsman in battle. In the Vedic scriptures it is revealed that  in  this
world 2 types of living entities are automatically granted entrance  to  the
heavenly planets: one  being  the  renunciate  who  is  disciplined  in  the
practice of yoga and the other is the warrior slain in  battle.  So  Arjunas
arguement is that although there is provision for the  slain,  there  is  no
declaration of any merit for the slayer.
