One who is not an annoyance or disturbance to anyone  or  anything  and  who
also does not feel any annoyance or disturbance from  anybody  or  anything,
being antagonistic to no one is equal to all and thus freed from the  mental
fluctuations of elation, intolerance, fear and anxiety is very dear  to  the
Supreme Lord Krishna.
