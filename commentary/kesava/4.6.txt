The question may be asked that  if  the  Supreme  Lord's  knowledge  is  not
veiled like Arjuna's then how is it that He manifests Himself? To  alleviate
this doubt Lord Krishna  replies  with  the  words  <i>ajo  pi  sann  avyayatma</i>
meaning He is unborn  having  an  imperishable  body.  His  body  is  purely
spiritual without being the result of any  previous  actions  and  manifests
itself by His own potency for the benefit of all the  worlds.  Moreover  the
characteristics of the Lord Krishna's <i>svarupa</i> or divine form have been  well
described in the Vedic scriptures the most precise being known  as  <i>sac-cid-</i>
<i>ananda</i> or comprised of eternity, knowledge and bliss.  He  Himself  declares
that being the omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent Supreme  Lord  of  all
possessing  unlimited  forms,  attributes  and  powers  which  contains  the
concentrated essence and the maximum  of  all  essences  when  He  manifests
Himself by  His  internal  potency  known  as  <i>yogamaya.</i>  There  is  nothing
imaginable or  unimaginable  that  is  impossible  for  Lord  Krishna.  Some
commentators interpret this verse to mean  that  Lord  Krishna  keeping  the
material nature under His control manifests Himself  through  it.  But  this
interpretation  is  not  valid  and  should  not  be  accepted  because   it
contradicts the Vedic scriptures of the Supreme Lord's  <i>svarupa</i>  being  <i>sac-</i>
<i>cid-ananda.</i> If we are to accept that the Supreme Lord's <i>svarupa</i>  comes  from
material nature comprised of the <i>gunas</i> or three modes of  goodness,  passion
and nescience then we must accept that it  is  made  of  elements  like  our
human body and is perishable also and that is false.  The  Vedic  scriptures
state that one who accepts that the Supreme Lord Krishna's <i>svarupa</i>  is  made
from material elements should be  excommunicated  and  considered  as  being
outside of the Vedic culture and Puranic injunctions.  Therefore  it  should
be clearly understood that those that have faith and believe in the  Supreme
Lord and the eternal Vedic scriptures should accept  only  the  commentaries
descending through <i>parampara</i> or authorised Vedic  disciplic  succession  and
which are never contradictory to the Vedas,  Puranas,  Upanisads  and  other
Vedic scriptures.
