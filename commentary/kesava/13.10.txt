The Supreme Lord Krishna who is known as <i>Parabrahma</i> is  the  source  of  the
<i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all  existence  which  is  without
and within the elements such as earth, water, fire, air,  ether,  etc.;  yet
He is outside of them  and  distinctly  different  and  separate  from  them
because He is their cause and they are His products. At the same time He  is
within all as well constituted as physical bodies constituted  by  the  five
elements in the inanimate  immovable  and  the  animate  movable.  In  every
aspect of creation He is existing in a subatomic manifestation in all  <i>jivas</i>
or embodied beings of every living entity as  the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul.
Because He exists in an extremely subtle subatomic state  it  is  impossible
to perceive Him by the senses or understand  Him  by  the  mind.  So  He  is
acutely incomprehensible and it is very difficult for  transmigrating  <i>jivas</i>
to realise that  He  is  different  and  separate  from  the  physical  body
although He resides within the etheric heart of all <i>jivas</i> as the  <i>atma.</i>  For
those <i>jivas</i> who are bereft of the  20  virtues  given  by  Lord  Krishna  in
verses 8 to 12 the <i>atma</i> is very far away indeed  meaning  the  consciousness
required for self-realisation in order to  realise  the  <i>atma</i>  is  very  far
away. Those <i>jivas</i> who are endowed with these 20 virtues  such  as  humility,
non-violence, serving the Vaisnava spiritual master, etc.; the <i>atma</i> is  very
near indeed meaning that the consciousness required for self-realisation  in
order to to realise the <i>atma</i> is very near.
