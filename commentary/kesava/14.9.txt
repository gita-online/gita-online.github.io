Here Lord Krishna describes in brief the functional capacity  of  the  three
<i>gunas</i> which are  <i>sattva guna</i> or the mode of goodness, <i>raja guna</i> or the  mode
of passion and <i>tama guna</i> or the mode of ignorance.  The  quality  of  <i>sattva</i>
impels the mind  to  be  attracted  to  happiness.  Although  there  may  be
situations of pain and discomfort the overall tendency of  the  mind  is  to
seek knowledge and experience joy. The quality of <i>rajas</i> activates  the  mind
to be attracted to action. Although there may be situations  of  tranquility
and calm the overall tendency is constant activity. The quality of <i>tamas</i>  is
obscuring and distorting knowledge  even  if  instructed  by  the  spiritual
master. Such  perversion  causes  the  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being  to  commit
degenerative activities that hinder it's well  being  and  blocks  it's  own
best interests.
