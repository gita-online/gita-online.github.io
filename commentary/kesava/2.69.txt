Thus one situated in yoga attaining the  state  of  transcendent  meditation
ceases from pursuing sensual objects because they have mastered  the  senses
and have them under controls. But the question may  arise  that  if  in  one
developed by yoga sense objects naturally come to and are  experienced  then
one may be deviated and cease to remain  in  the  transcendent  state.  Lord
Krishna refutes this doubt by this verse. As water entering the  ocean  does
not affect or change the ocean; likewise the yogi immersed  in  transcendent
meditation is unaffected and unchanged by those things interacting with  the
senses which are destined  to  come  due  to  previous  karma  or  by  fate.
Although they may be  experienced   they  in  themselves  are  not  powerful
enough to generate any change or deviation internally. Thus such a  one  has
attained peace in the form of liberation from extreme joy as well as  misery
because the desires causing actions which are the  cause  of  all  types  of
misery are terminated but ones devotedness to the yoga does not deviate  and
does not terminate. Contrarily one who is inclined  to  ruminates  over  and
hankers after sensual  enjoyments  can  never  find  peace  and  incessantly
revolves in the material existence  buffeted  hither  and  thither   by  the
negative and positive reactions of their own desires.
