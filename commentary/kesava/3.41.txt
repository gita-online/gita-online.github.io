Now Lord Krishna explains how to restrain kama or  lust  which
is so  terrible  and  destructive  to  the  consciousness  and
development of a human being and which  is  the  root  of  all
evils because it obscures  true  knowledge  arising  from  the
teachings of the spiritual master which lead to  inner  wisdom
which arises from meditation and  reflection  on  the  Supreme
Lord. One must withdraw the senses away from the sense objects
at the very beginning before  they  have  contact  and  remain
resolute with a steady mind.
