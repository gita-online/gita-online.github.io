By stating anotherâs duty is fraught with danger Lord  Krishna
was indicating that fear of hellish  births  wa  the  fear  in
question. Arjuna understood this; but now he is  enquiring  if
there is another reason sins are committed. It is  known  that
sins lead one to hell and no fear is greater then the fear  of
going to hellish regions; so what is it that compels beings to
commit sins even against  their  better  judgement  as  though
driven by force.
