What should one  do?  Lord  Krishna  states  here  to  remain  balanced  and
equipoised. Discard the mentality of being attached. Be balanced  in  either
victory or defeat and perform your duties.  Karmani  refers  to  duties  the
plural usage of duties indicates various obligatory and  occasional  duties;
but the optional duty is not to be included among  these  as  they  are  not
required. Otherwise there would be contradiction between the former and  the
latter statements. Yoga is explained by Lord Krishna  Himself  as  being  in
the state of equanimity.
