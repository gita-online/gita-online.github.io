In this way Lord Krishna has explained that those who  possess
endless desire for the enjoyment of sense objects  must  offer
the food they eat in yagna or worship to purify themselves  to
to be able to perform prescribed Vedic activities according to
oneâs qualification for the optimal benefit to themselves  and
by which actions assist the efficacy of  the  world,  universe
and all of creation. Now Lord Krishna is describing  that  the
person who having achieved atma-tattva or soul realisation and
is freed from all material desires is faultless  even  by  not
performing prescribed  Vedic  actions.  But  the  particle  tu
emphasises the huge difference between the person with desires
who pursues sense enjoyments delighting in the five senses  of
touch, taste etc. and the opposite sex; and the person without
desires who takes delight only in the bliss of  their  eternal
soul and the Supreme Lord. For such a self realised  soul  who
has already attained the goal of human existence no ordinances
of the Vedic scripture are required by them.
