Knowledge is of two types mundane  and  transitory  and  transcendental  and
eternal; but why is it that all those whose minds  have  been  enveloped  in
ignorance since time immemorial are so infatuated while others are  able  to
free themselves from delusion? It is do to the Supreme Lords  grace  through
the mercy of His devotee that those are able to  free  themselves  from  the
infatuation of delusion. Only be the grace of the Supreme Lords  devotee  is
one able to reverse the envelopment of ignorance constituted by the  mindset
fashioned from reactions to one's  actions  and  flow  towards  the  eternal
nature of the <i>atma</i> or soul  which  is  realised  by  continuous  reflection,
contemplation and meditation upon the  teachings  of  the  Vedic  scriptures
received through the mouth of the spiritual master and the following of  His
instructions who has himself realised the essence of  the  Vedic  scriptures
and who has achieved  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  soul  and  has
attained the Supreme Being which is completely transcendental to all  things
material and is like the rising of the sun  illuminating  the  consciousness
in all directions to those who have knowledge of . This is why  such  beings
do not get infatuated and become deluded.

With the statement in the possessive  case  <i>adityavit  jnanam</i>  meaning  true
knowledge shining like the sun  and  the  statement  <i>prakasayati  tat  param</i>
meaning reveals the supreme being, Lord Krishna  refutes  the  adherents  of
absolute monism because it is not possible to have even an iota  of  contact
with it because of the plural inference of the word  <i>atmanah</i>  meaning  souls
even after their ignorance is dispelled. This refutes those  who  deny  that
knowledge is different from its nature and also refutes those  who  propound
oneness of the quality and the qualified  trying  to  establish  a  relation
with the knower and knowledge like light  and  its  source.  Because  it  is
known that knowledge is distinctively different from the nature of the  <i>atma</i>
or soul. This infers that gross and subtle embodied beings  created  in  the
material existence due to  reactions  from  past  life  activities  obscures
knowledge into a lesser quality like the light of a lamp  is  lessened  when
covered  by  a  shaded  glass  although  it  does  not  change  its  nature.
Contrarily when one has achieved <i>atma tattva</i> then in the state of  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation the destruction of the physical and  subtle  bodies  reveals  the
knowledge of the <i>atmas</i> quality as the light of a lamp is  more  illuminating
when the shaded glass cover is removed; yet there is no  difference  in  its
nature but only in its perception. As  by  the  removal  of  the  impurities
obscuring a jewel allows its radiance to be seen; in the same way  when  the
impurity of undesirable mundane qualities like  lust  and  fruitiveness  are
removed  and  abandoned  then  the  transcendental  qualities   of   wisdom,
renunciation and compassion reveal themselves in all their splendour.  These
qualities  are  always  present  without  being  created  because  they  are
eternally manifest as qualities of the <i>atma.</i>
