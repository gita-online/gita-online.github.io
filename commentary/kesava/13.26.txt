It may be comprehended that <i>paramatma</i> the  all  pervading  Supreme  Soul  as
well as the  localised  <i>atma</i>  or  the  immortal  individual  soul  are  both
distinctly different from <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading
physical existence. It may also be understood that it is only by the  medium
of <i>prakriti</i> that bodies and senses manifest and cause the <i>jiva</i> or   embodied
being to engage in activities which gives <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  to  actions.
But the question may be raised that if <i>paramatma</i>  and  the  <i>atma</i>  have  such
intimate contact with the physical body which is experiencing joy and  grief
as it performs unlimited activities; then how are they  both  not  affected,
implicated and contaminated  by  such     enactments  and  remain  only  the
witness and monitor. Anticipating such a query  Lord  Krishna  answers  that
they are both <i>anaditvan nirgunatvat</i>  meaning eternal without  beginning  and
possessing no material qualities or attributes whatsoever. Imperishable  the
knower of the sphere of activity, supreme because  they  are  transcendental
to <i>prakriti</i> and everything material including the physical  body,  mind  and
intellect which is in specific illustrative examples sometimes  referred  to
as the self. Whatever has  manifested  from  <i>prakriti</i>  possesses  the  three
<i>gunas</i> or goodness, passion and nescience and are perishable. This  comprises
the scope of <i>prakriti</i> but <i>paramtama</i> and the <i>atma</i> are not implicated  by  the
physical body or influenced by its modifications thereof and  therefore  are
only monitoring all thoughts and actions as the witness.
