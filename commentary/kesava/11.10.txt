Sanjaya elaborates upon the Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine,
universal form with the word <i>anatam</i> meaning unlimited  refers  to  unlimited
eyes, unlimited mouths, unlimited faces  and  unlimited  wonders,  unlimited
ornaments, unlimited weapons and unlimited marvels. All are  devoid  of  the
threefold limits of time, space  and  form  and  are  transcendental,  self-
effulgent and infinite.
