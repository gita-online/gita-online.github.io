Now Lord Krishna declares the results one acquires by  knowing  Him  as  the
ultimate, absolute, paramount supremacy to all that exists.  Those  who  are
not subject to illusion and delusion, who can discriminate  between  between
the physical body and the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul and have  realised  that  He
is <i>Purusottama</i> the Supreme being. These are the  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings
that are all knowing for they have perceived the  essence  as  well  as  the
goal  of  all  existence.  This  is  confirmed  in  the  Chandogya  Upanisad
III.XIV.VI beginning <i>sarvakarmi sarvakamah sarvagandhah  sarvarash</i>  meaning:
The Supreme  Lord  is  the  cause  of  all  causes,  the  supreme  divinity,
possessing all transcendental qualities and endowed with glorious,  blissful
accruements, whose immanence is all pervading. In chapter 7,  verse  7  Lord
Krishna has already revealed that there is nothing  higher  then  Him.  Thus
the spiritually evolved propitiate and worship Lord Krishna with  <i>bhakti</i>  or
exclusive loving devotion by speech with  prayers  to  Him,  by  voice  with
songs of hommage to Him, by sacred actions  dedicated to Him and by  a  mind
totally absorbed in love for Him. Except for the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  who
exists within the innermost etheric heart of all <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings
as <i>Paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul: there is none else more worthy  of  adoration
then Him. It is stated in the Moksa Dharma known  as  the  Mahabharata  that
the demigods take refuge in Shiva, who in turn takes shelter of Brahma,  who
in turn takes refuge in the Supreme  Lord;  but  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
takes refuge in nothing. The knowers of the ultimate truth  do  not  worship
Brahma, Shiva, the demigods or any other god because they cannot  equate  to
the paramount position of the Supreme Lord Krishna in any  way.  Neither  is
it possible for any of them to bestow the  unequivocal,  absolute  knowledge
that Lord Krishna bequeaths in Srimad Bhagavad-Gita.
