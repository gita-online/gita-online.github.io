A person who is interested in attaining  atma-tattva  or  soul
realisation must perform activities without desire  unattached
to the results. The reason being that one without desires  has
their mind focused on the  Supreme  Lord  and  such  direction
leads to spiritual knowledge. So Lord Krishna  is  emphasising
this point that while performing prescribed Vedic  actions  in
this way without attachment, with the  consciousness  directed
towards the Supreme Lord, naturally purity of  mind  developes
and then spiritual knowledge after which the highest moksa  or
liberation from the material existence is attained
