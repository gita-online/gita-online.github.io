Among the Daityas or descendants of Diti who are of the demoniac line,  Lord
Krishna's <i>vibhuti</i> is the great devotee Prahlad whose  name  literally  means
one who makes the righteous happy  and  who  is  surrendered  fully  to  the
Supreme Lord with <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving  devotion.  Among  measurements
His <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental opulence is time the  prime  cause  of
all results and comprised of divisions  such  as  seconds,  minutes,  hours,
days, months, years, millenniums etc. Among birds His <i>vibhuti</i> is Garuda  the
carrier of Vishnu.
