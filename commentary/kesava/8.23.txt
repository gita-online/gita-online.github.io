Lord Krishna has  declared  that  those  who  realise  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  the
spiritual substratum pervading all  existence  and  also  those  who  attain
realisation of the Supreme Lord are not subjected to <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual
cycle of birth and death and no longer take birth in the worlds of  mortals,
whereas others must take birth there. There are the route of the  celestials
and the route of the <i>Manes</i> or ancestors. Now the question to be known is  by
what route does one not take  birth  again?  Lord  Krishna  introduces  both
paths beginning with the words <i>yatra kale</i> meaning by which time.   Here  the
word <i>kale</i> refers to the route taken by the soul departing  the  body  of  an
aspirant and escorted by the servitor of the presiding demigod of  the  day,
month, year, etc. who are the transporting demigods.  The  names  Agni   and
Jyotis are referring to the presiding demigods  of  fire  and  illumination.
They are not referring to time because in the Chandogya Upanisad IV.XV.V  it
states: From a year to the sun god, etc.  The  presiding  demigods  such  as
<i>Surya</i> the sun god are stated in the conclusion which is appropriate  as  the
preceding and succeeding names are prescribed for the demigods  and  thus  a
day, month, etc. stands for their respective times of  these  demigods.  The
purport is that the aspirants taking the route of  the  respective  demigods
are twofold: Those who have perfected the path of  spiritual  knowledge  and
those who have perfected the path of detached renunciation. Those  who  have
reached perfection by spiritual knowledge do not  take  birth  again.  Those
who even though have perfected detached renunciation still must  take  birth
again.
