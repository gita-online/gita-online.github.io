By previously  establishing  the  depreciating  effects  of  the  senses  in
affecting the mind and degrading the intellect, Lord Krishna  now  concludes
this topic by explaining that the problem to be addressed is the senses  and
that one who has the potency to  restrain  their  senses  from  their  sense
objects is one who is situated in transcendent meditation.
