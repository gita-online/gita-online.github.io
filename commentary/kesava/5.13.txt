It was stated previously that the renunciate is not bound to  reactions  due
to lack attachment but the ignorant desiring rewards are bound to  reactions
due to attachment. But who is virtuous and who is sinful  when  the  actions
of all beings is impelled by the Supreme  Lord  hence  virtuous  and  sinful
actions should go to Him. To this point Lord Krishna answers in  this  verse
and  the  next  that  theSupreme  Lord  is  not  involved  influencing   any
activities of the embodied beings, neither the pious  or  sinful  activities
nor any acceptance or involvement in the  merits  or  demerits  acquired  by
one's activities. The word <i>loka</i> has two meaning  in  the  Amarakosa  Lexicon
III.III.II one meaning is the world and the other is people which  sometimes
is synonymous as here. It is the nature of  people,  embodied  beings  which
determines the degree of nescience constituted by  actions  engaged  in  and
reactions accepted since time immemorial. The understanding is  that  it  is
the Supreme Lords external energy <i>maya</i> or the deluding illusory energy  that
directs the embodied being according  to  their  degree  of  nescience  from
reactions to past life activities.
