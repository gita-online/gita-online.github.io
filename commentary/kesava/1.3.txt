Duryodhana  in order to kindle some anger in  the  heart  of  his  preceptor
Drona, speaks about the excellence of the Pandava army cynically  using  the
words: <i>Behold the mighty army of the  Pandavas  well  arranged  in  military</i>
<i>phalanx.</i> Here Duryodhana is conveying to Drona that the Pandavas  have  come
prepared to engage in battle. Duryodhana   wants  to  further  incite  Drona
against the Pandavas by the use  of  the  word  <i>Behold</i>  implying  that  with
unmitigated arrogance the Pandavas are fast approaching without waiting  for
us to start who are depending upon Drona himself. If Drona then  puts  forth
that the Pandavas are his pupils as well and due to Yudhisthira being  elder
have the right to start  before  you  if  they  so  desire.  But  Duryodhana
anticipating that response, overtly mentions Dhritadyumna the  commander  of
the Pandava army by calling him the son of Drupada, to remind  Drona of  his
being the son of his mortal enemy, so there  should  be  no  compassion  for
them. If Drona then argues that one should not fight  with  the  son  of  an
enemy who is commander of an opposing army, Duryodhana   by  also  referring
to Dhritadyumna as Dronas disciple neutralises that argument by the  offence
incurred of his in choosing to fight against a preceptor a condemned  action
so  there  is  no  doubt  as  to  motivation.  Duryodhana  by  also  calling
Dhristadyumna intelligent suggests that everything as  a  pupil  he  learned
from Drona would now be used against him so there should  be  no  hesitation
or neglect towards him as he has made up his mind to take Dronas life.

What Sanjaya is subtlety conveying to Dhritarastra is  that  his  son,  King
Duryodhana uninfluenced by the sanctity Kuruksetra possesses no  inclination
for righteousness. A serpent even though fed with  milk  does  give  up  its
venom; on the contrary it increases its poison and anger. So also  the  same
regarding your son, you should not worry that he will  ever  return  to  the
kingdom to the Pandavas for he definitely will not.
