Now Lord Krishna expounds upon the characteristics of  one  who  has  become
qualified for realising the state of the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence. One who has experienced  the  wisdom  derived  from
the manifestation of pure knowledge and is  of  cheerful  mind  without  any
desire for sense objects, who neither greives what is  lost  or  craves  for
what  is  unachieved,  who  due  to  inner   satisfaction   resulting   from
perception of the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul, regards a clod of  earth,  a  stone
and a lump of gold as all the same  and  looks  at  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings with the same equanimity. Such a one is not a  friend  to  those  who
praise and honor him; nor an enemy to those who criticise and ridicule  him.
Such ones attain supreme state known as <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving  devotion
unto the  Supreme Lord. <i>Bhakti</i> is the supreme perfection of  all  knowledge.
The famous verse in Bhagavat Purana I.VII.X beginning  <i>atmaramas  ca  munayo</i>
meaning: All types of liberated beings who delight  in  communion  with  the
immortal soul and are free from material bondage; still  eagerly  desire  to
render <i>bhakti</i> unto the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His  authorised
incarnations as revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures.  This  confirms  that  Lord
Krishna has transcendental qualities  and  divine  attributes  so  wonderful
that even  those  who  have  achieved  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence are still enthused to worship and  serve   Him.  Liberated  beings
referred to are the four Kumaras led by Sanandana. In  this  way  explaining
the highest platform as that of one who  renders  <i>bhakti</i>  unto  the  Supreme
Lord with total purity of  heart  who  is  established  in  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the immortal soul. Devoid of these qualifications it  is  not
possible to realise the state of the <i>brahman</i>  in  which  one  perceives  all
<i>jivas</i> in a state of perfect equanimity. In  the  absence  of  realising  the
state of <i>brahman</i> it is imposiible to become established in <i>atma  tattva</i>  and
devoid of <i>atma tattva</i> is is impossible to achieve  the  supreme  destination
and attain communion with the Supreme Lord.
