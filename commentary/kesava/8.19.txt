A doubt may arise that  any  action  performed  by  those  absorbed  may  be
destroyed and later when they reappear they may  have  to  perform  entirely
new actions. Lord Krishna  refutes  this  doubt  and  evokes  dispassion  by
inferring enough  pondering  over  the  36,000  cycles  of  dissolution  and
creation which transpire during Brahma's lifetime and in which  contains  43
million 200 thousand births and deaths for a human  being  based  on  a  100
year life span. Lord Krishna specifically clarifies  that  all  movable  and
immovable living entities that existed on the previous  day  of  Brahma  are
all manifested again and again as variegated and  diverse  species  such  as
demigod, human, animal, bird, fish etc., all in precise accordance with  the
inviolable laws of <i>karma</i> or the subsequent reactions  to  previous  actions.
Then again at the beginning of the night of Brahma all are  dissolved  again
under  the  compulsion  of  his  nature  and  are  absorbed  back  into  the
unmanifest which is Brahma's subtle body.  The  Vedic  scriptures  proclaim:
The creation of the sun, the moon, the Earth, the sky  are  all  exactly  as
they were before. Then  after  36,000  times  of  creation  and  dissolution
Brahma's life span is ended. At this time all beings movable  and  immovable
all  planetary  systems  and  universes,  even  Brahma  and  his  planet  of
Maharloka are all dissolved into the ultimate unmanifest starting  from  the
Earth each of the worlds dissolve and are absorbed into the  Supreme  Being.
The Subala Upanisad states: Earth devolves into water, water  devolves  into
fire, fire devolves into air, air devolves into ether and  so  forth  up  to
the cosmos which devolves into the <i>avyakta</i> or unmanifest, the  <i>avyakta</i>  into
the <i>akshara</i> or the indestructible, the <i>akshara</i> into <i>tamas</i>  or  darkness  and
the <i>tamas</i> into the Supreme Lord Krishna, within everything merges.  Thus  it
is confirmed that except for the eternal spiritual  worlds  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna, all beings and the  entire  material  creation  consisting  of
trillions of universes are subject to  incessant  creation  and  dissolution
periodically.
<p>
Although this process irrevocably applies  to  all  beings  indiscriminately
there is one exception. In the case of Lord Krishna's initiated devotees  in
authorised <i>parampara</i> or disciplic  succession  from  any  one  of  the  four
bonafide  <i>sampradaya's</i>  as  confirmed  in  Vedic  scriptures  being   Brahma
Sampradaya, Sri Sampradaya, Rudra Sampradaya  and  Kumara  Sampradaya;  they
alone are exempt from rebirth again for once attaining  Lord  Krishna  there
is no question of any one of them ever having to take birth in the  material
worlds again for they are automatically promoted to  the  eternal  spiritual
worlds to associate with Him.
