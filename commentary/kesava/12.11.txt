Lord Krishna explained in the previous verse that by following  renunciation
for the rewards of actions one achieves the Supreme  peace.  Now  explaining
further He declares that His devotee who has become  renounced  should  also
possess the virtues given in seven  verses  beginning  with  <i>advesta  sarva-</i>
<i>bhutanam</i> meaning free from enmity towards any  living  being.  One  reflects
that all misfortunes are due to their past <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  from  one's
own actions. One is also <i>karuna</i> or compassionate to those  in  need  and  is
<i>nirmamo</i> or free from possessiveness of even relatives  and  <i>nirahankarah</i>  or
ego sense from even one's physical body and things other than  the  <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul. Who is  <i>dukha-sukha</i>  or  even  minded  and  self-satisfied  in
happiness or distress with whatever comes of its own accord.  Who  is  <i>ksami</i>
or  tolerant  and  <i>drdha-niscaya</i>  meaning  firmly  resolved  and  resolutely
determined to fully follow the teachings of the  spiritual  master  and  the
Vedic scriptures and perform <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive  loving  devotion  to  Lord
Krishna. One who has ceased to  pursue the desires of the senses and  mental
tendencies  of  the  mind  and  has  instead  directed  their  consciousness
internally  to  the  <i>atma</i>  in  the  heart  surrendering   their   mind   and
intelligence to the Supreme Lord Krishna verily worship  Him  and  are  very
dear to Him.
