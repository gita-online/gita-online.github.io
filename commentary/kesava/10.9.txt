Lord Krishna speaks of the results such devotees are benedicted  by  <i>satata-</i>
<i>yuktanam</i> or constantly aspiring for communion with Him,  through  meditation
and worship; He personally as <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme  Soul  within  bequeaths
the inner inspiration whereby they unfailingly come to Him.
