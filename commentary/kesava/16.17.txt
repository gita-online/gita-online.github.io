Lord Krishna praises the avoidance of lust, greed and anger for by doing  so
the highest good and well being of a human being is  assured.  Freedom  from
these  voracious  evils  allows  one  to  engage  in  spiritual   activities
beneficial for oneself and all creation  by  the  acquisition  of  spiritual
knowledge concerning devotion to the Supreme Lord  along  with  <i>atma  tattva</i>
realisation of the soul and <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from  material  existence.
This insures one will never have to enter a hellish condition  of  life  and
eventually will attain the Supreme Lord.
