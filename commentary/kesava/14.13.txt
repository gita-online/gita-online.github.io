Here Lord Krishna speaks of the indications of <i>tama  guna</i>  or  the  mode  of
ignorance with the presence of inertia, indolence and delusion in  the  mind
and in the  senses..  The  word  <i>moha</i>  means  absorbed  in  illusion;  hence
neglectfulnesss  of the teachings of the spiritual master,  carelessness  in
obligatory duties such as fasting from all grains on <i>ekadasi</i>  which  is  the
11th day leading to the new moon and  full  moon.  Listlessness,  inactivity
and  subject  to  the  illusion  of  perverting   reality   with   distorted
impressions giving a false view of life. By all  these  things  one  can  be
seen to be controlled by <i>tama guna.</i>
