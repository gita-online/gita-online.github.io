If such a hopeless situation exists as given in  the  previous
verse why does everyone not follow the  sublime  teachings  of
Bhagavad-Gita? Why are so many  living  entities  hostile  and
antagonistic to the Bhagavad-Gitaâs pristine instructions?  In
answer to this Lord Krishna states that all  creatures  follow
accordingly to whatever nature they  have  attained  and  that
nature shapes their actions.  This  nature  is  acquired  from
activities performed in past lives which ripen in this life as
impressions of positive of  negative  acts.  Even  persons  of
wisdom in Vedic knowledge do not act  contrary  to  their  own
natures. So what to say of  the  ignorant?  They  must  follow
there nature also acting in ignorance.  The  purport  is  that
although it may  be  possible  for  such  persons  to  abandon
desires and attachment, the necessary purity of mind does  not
manifest to evoke feelings of dedication to the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna and His impeccable treatise of Bhagavad-Gita.
