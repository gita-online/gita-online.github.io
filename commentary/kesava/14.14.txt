Now Lord Krishna explains that a <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  when  situated  in
<i>sattva guna</i> or mode of goodness at the moment  of  death  reaches  the  pure
unblemished association of the spiritually perfected in the higher  heavenly
planets up to the planet of Brahma which is where  the  virtuous  and  pious
reside.
