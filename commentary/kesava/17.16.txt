Here Lord Krishna explains that the austerity that  is  foolishly  practiced
because of repeated habit and useless attachment or is diabolically  engaged
in due to depraved  perversity  where  one  tortures  oneself  as  in  self-
mortification to gain power or which causes injury, pain  and  suffering  to
other living entities such as blood rituals of animal and human  sacrifices,
is situated irrevocably in the inertia of darkness in <i>tama guna</i> the mode  of
ignorance.
