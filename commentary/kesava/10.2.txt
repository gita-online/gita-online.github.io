One may wonder how to remedy the fact that there are so  many  philosophers,
theosophical thinkers, and erudite scholars who are unable to  realise  Lord
Krishna's  supreme,  transcendental  position  as  the  cause,  source   and
ultimate controller of all creation.  To  augment  this  view  Lord  Krishna
referring to the demigods and the great liberated sages states the words  <i>na</i>
<i>viduh</i> which means that even they  are  unable  to  understand  Him.  Neither
Indra the chief of the celestial demigods nor  Bhrigu  the  crest  jewel  of
sages are able to perceive beyond the parameters of their  mind  and  senses
and  comprehend  the  divine  reality  of  Lord   Krishna's   transcendental
appearance in human form  endowed  with  supreme  indomitable  never  ending
glory. <i>Saccidananda</i>  or  eternal  existence,  unlimited   consciousness  and
endless bliss. Unlike  the  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  inhabiting  various
bodies throughout creation who take birth due to their actions and whom  the
Supreme Lord bestows upon  them  knowledge  and  power  according  to  their
merits. As the <i>jivas</i> are His creation arising from Him although  eternal  as
well they are severely limited possessing only finite  knowledge.  Hence  it
is impossible to know the reality of  the  Supreme  Absolute  Truth  without
being properly instructed in <i>parampara</i> or disciplic succession from  one  of
the four <i>sampradayas</i> or spiritual channels authorised in Vedic scriptures.
