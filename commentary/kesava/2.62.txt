Lord Krishna further explains here that from anger arises delusion which  is
the lack of discrimination about knowing what actions to  perform  and  what
actions not  to  perform.   From  delusion  comes  confusion  which  is  the
bewilderment of intelligence and forgetfulness of the truths written in  the
Vedic scriptures instructed by the spiritual master.  From  confusion  comes
illusion the misinterpretation of intellect in determining the  true  nature
of reality. From illusion one becomes completely ruined. One loses focus  on
the goal of material existence and the purpose of human life  and  lives  in
the darkness of nescience. Thus it must be understood that controlling  ones
mind is essential.
