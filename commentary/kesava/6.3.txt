If the previous verse is true then does one have to perform  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or
prescribed Vedic activities until death? Lord Krishna  clarifies  this  with
the word <i>aruruksoh</i> meaning who aspires. If one is aspiring for  <i>atma  tattva</i>
or realisation of the soul then <i>karma yoga</i> is merely a stepping stone  until
one is established in selfless actions without ego influence.  Such  actions
soon lead to renunciation which culminates in <i>dhyana yoga</i> or the science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness by meditation. The purport is that an aspirant should  perform
prescribed  Vedic  activities  until  they  are  securely   established   in
renunciation which initiates reflection and introspection,   culminating  in
meditation which leads to the attainment of <i>atma tattva.</i>
