It is fine that the reality concerning  the  <i>ksetra</i>  will  be  described  in
brief but the need may arise for further evidence  in  detail.  Anticipating
such queries Lord Krishna confirms that it is also eulogised by <i>rsibhih</i>  the
sages such as Vasistha and Parasara and is revealed in the Vedic  scriptures
in various precise and concise ways. The  Taittriya  Upanisad  II.I  states:
Verily is the Supreme Lord the essence of food.  The  person  consisting  of
food is the physical body of the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being, then  the  next  is
the breath followed by the mind. Further in verse II.IV  it  states:  Verily
after that within of the mind which consists of intellect there  exists  the
<i>atma</i> or eternal soul which consists of consciousness. This is the nature  of
the <i>jiva.</i> These facts have been stated explicitly by Vedavyasa  in  the  Rg,
Yajur, Sama and  Atharva  Vedas  and  and  conclusively  proven  in  Vedanta
Sutras. All the conclusions from the Vedic  scriptures  are  harmonious  and
clear to the Vaisnava devotees and the <i>pandits</i>  or  scholars  in  the  Vedic
culture as well.  The  Vedanta  Sutras  reveals  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence and the ultimate truth in an  abbreviated
form yet it is more exact and profound. The  Vedas  reveal  it  in  explicit
detail and the Upanisads reveal its  nature,  attributes  and  glories  very
elaborately. An  aphorism  is  defined  as  concise,  precise,  unequivocal,
understandable, eternal and free from  illusion.   The  Vedanta  Sutras  are
aphorisms on the investigation and knowledge of the  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal  soul
and the ultimate truth.

It should not be assumed that the Vedanta  Sutras  discuss  only  about  the
<i>brahman</i> because that is not the case, for in order to  impart  knowledge  of
the <i>brahman</i> the <i>atma,</i> the <i>jiva</i> and  the Supreme Lord must also be  discussed
as well, along with the invariable attributes of  omnipresence,  sustenance,
purity, maintenance, etc. These things could not be  comprehended  correctly
without understanding their relationship to the Supreme Lord. Neither  could
they be propounded properly without defining  their  relationship  with  the
<i>atma</i>  which is fully controlled and dependent and mercifully graced  by  the
Supreme Lord. So descriptions of  the embodied soul and its  origin,  nature
and function are very beneficial regarding  knowledge  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  and
there is no contradiction anywhere in the Vedic scriptures in any  way.  For
example ether is known not to be created as it is not stated it  is  in  the
Vedic scriptures. This is confirmed in Vedanta  Sutras  II.III.I.  Also  the
<i>atma</i> being eternal is not created because  no  Vedic  scripture  has  stated
thus. The individual <i>atma</i> is the  knower  and  omniscient  as  confirmed  in
Vedanta Sutras II.III.XVII. So for both examples the effect  is  established
by understanding the cause. So this topic has been well spoken of in  detail
both generally and specifically of <i>ksetra</i> and the <i>ksetra-jna</i>  but  now  Lord
Krishna will concisely explain it further.
