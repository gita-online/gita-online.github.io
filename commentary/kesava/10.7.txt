Lord Krishna expresses the immense devotion  the  great  illuminated  beings
who <i>matva</i> or have realised His Supreme Absolute  position  and  incomparable
glories as the  Ultimate  Reality,  the  Ultimate  Truth  and  the  Ultimate
Personality controlling all beings in all existences. He the sole object  to
be known and the goal o all knowledge. He is recognisable  through  external
identifying manifestations such as the cause of creation, the origin of  all
living entities , the source of all existence etc. He is the prime cause  of
all created beings and all  things  sentient  and  insentient,  movable  and
immovable. He also monitors the ascent and descent  of  all  beings  through
higher and lower planetary species and up and down  into  higher  and  lower
species of life including their internal growth  and  evolution.  Everything
is manifested, energised and activated  because  of  Lord  Krishna's  desire
alone and the spiritually intelligent realising  this  continuously  worship
Him fully with devotion and love.
