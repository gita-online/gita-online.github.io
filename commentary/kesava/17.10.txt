The ritual or ceremony of any kind that is devoid of guidance of the  Vedics
scriptures and ignores and  refrains  from  following  the  injunctions  and
ordinances of the Vedic scriptures due to indifference  or  belligerence  is
know to be firmly situated in <i>tama  guna.</i>  Wherever  no  Vedic  mantras  are
chanted by duly initiated Vaisnavas and  brahmanas,  wherever  there  is  no
devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His  authorised  incarnations
and expansions as revealed in Vedic  scriptures  ad  wherever  there  is  an
absence of faith in Lord Krishna is  always  irrevocably  situated  in  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna.</i>
