In preceding verses Lord Krishna has indicated that a yogi  can  attain  the
<i>Brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  and  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation as well Now He presents in brief  the  method  of  meditation  to
achieve this. The five sense objects sight, sound, taste,  touch  and  smell
enter the mind through the five gates of the physical body being  the  eyes,
ears, tongue, hands and nose. All of them  must  be  dextrously  avoided  so
they exert no influence. The eyes must be half closed focused within on  the
point between the eyebrows. If they are wide open they may be distracted  by
external objects and if they are fully  closed  one  may  fall  asleep.  The
breath must be regulated and controlled until gently and  effortlessly  with
constant practice the breath  becomes  suspended  automatically  controlling
the mind and senses. Such a  reflective  and  determined  person  intent  on
attaining <i>moksa</i>  even  while  steadfastly  practising  such  austerities  is
liberated in that very life.
