Here it can be discerned that unlike the deities  of  other  gods  who  need
extensive exertion and effort to gain their benedictions,  the  devotees  of
Lord Krishna feel perfectly at ease in worshipping Him. This is what  He  is
indicating by the words <i>me bhaktya prayacchati</i> meaning offering to Him  with
loving devotion. Even if one of sinless mind and pure heart  fully  focusing
on the Supreme Lord offers Him something that  is  obtained  without  effort
such as water or even a leaf or flower; if it is imbued with devotion it  is
sanctified and the Supreme Lord, who is  the  fully  content  and  cognisant
controller of the  entire  creation  indecipherable  by  Brahma  and  Shiva,
becomes pleased and  indeed  He  feels  indebted  to  such  a  devotee.  The
Narayaniya section of  Mahabharata  states:  Brahma,  Shiva,  the  demigods,
other gods, the Daityas, Danavas, Raksasas,  Asuras,  celestial  sages,  the
Nagas, Garuda, Gandharvas, Siddhas and royal sages that  whatever  oblations
either sacrificial or ancestral all ends up automatically  at  the  feet  of
the  Supreme  Lord.   But  whatever  action  is  performed  with  <i>bhakti</i>  or
exclusive loving devotion to Him, He accepts with  the  utmost  appreciative
and affectionate love.
