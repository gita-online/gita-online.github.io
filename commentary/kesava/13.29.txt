Lord Krishna concludes this chapter with a brief synopsis  of  what  He  has
elaborated upon distinguishing the <i>ksetra</i> or  sphere  of  activity  and  the
<i>ksetrajna</i> or the  knower  of  the  sphere  of  activity.  The  <i>atma</i>  or  the
individual immortal soul and <i>paramatma</i> or the  all  pervading  Supreme  Soul
and the difference of both from each other as well as from <i>prakriti</i>  or  the
material substratum pervading physical existence. He  proclaims  that  those
by the vision of knowledge inferring that was acquired by the  teachings  of
the spiritual master from the Vedic scriptures  through  who  realise  these
things achieve perfection and attain the supreme destination.
<p>
I take complete refuge in the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  the  omniscient  and
omnipotent Supreme Being, the  controller  of  all.  Who  out  of  causeless
compassion categorically instructed  the  discriminative  knowledge  of  the
<i>ksetra</i> and the <i>ksetrajna</i>.
