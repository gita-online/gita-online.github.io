Now it may be wondered that if a person who abandons the  path  of  <i>yoga</i>  or
the science of the individual consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness never meets with an evil destiny, then  exactly  what
is the destination of such a person? Lord Krishna answers this by  revealing
that after death such a person by the power  of  <i>yoga</i>  resides  for  a  long
duration of time on the higher planets of the righteous to reap the  results
which one has merited. After which the results  reaped  are  exhausted,  one
takes birth in a pious and wealthy family
