To answer  the  previous  verse  Lord  Krishna  states  the  word  <i>sannyasam</i>
<i>karmanam</i> or  the  renunciation  of  actions.  The  path  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or
prescribed Vedic ativities  and  renunciation  of  the  rewards  from  one's
actions both lead to <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation. But of the  two  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> is superior.
