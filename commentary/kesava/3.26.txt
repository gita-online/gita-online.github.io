As a person who falls in the mud is stained by the mud in  the
same way an ignorant person attached to the rewards  of  their
actions is stained with having to receive negative  reactions.
Lord Krishna is stating  that  a  person  of  Vedic  spiritual
wisdom should impart knowledge to them but in a simplified way
knowing that the ignorant are lacking in purity  of  mind  and
are not qualified to perform prescribed Vedic  activities  one
of spiritual wisdom should not disturb their  equilibrium  and
confuse  them  with  superior  teachings  as  this  will  only
acerbate their self esteem. The spiritually wise should merely
encourage the ignorant to  continuously  perform  their  daily
activities as a matter of duty  without  attachment  and  also
perform occasional duties on special  occasions  in  the  same
spirit as well.
