Lord  Krishna  is  the  supreme  omniscient,  omnipotent   and   omnipresent
controller of all. Although the source of all creation He is  unattached  to
His creation while still being  compassionate to all  living  entities.  Why
then does not everyone take the mercy of the Supreme Lord and  attain  <i>moksa</i>
or liberation from the material existence. The words  <i>avajananti  mam  mudah</i>
means ignorant fools blaspheme the Supreme Lord.  This  is  because  due  to
accumulations of sins since time immemorial they become infatuated by  their
material  designations  and  possessions  and  so  deluded  are  unable   to
recognise the paramount  position  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or  even
achieve the association of His devotees. Such fools think the  Supreme  Lord
is an  ordinary  human  being  because  He  appears  to  be  human  although
factually He possesses an eternal transcendental, spiritual form which  only
appears human. These ignorant wretches deride  and  disrespect  the  Supreme
Lord and refuse to accept Him as the Lord of the entire creation;  at  times
even substituting their own  inferior  gods  as  the  Supreme  Lord  without
having   the   authoritative   evidence   to   support    such    fallacious
misrepresentations.  Such deluded fools falsely think  of  Lord  Krishna  as
they do any other person and thus are beguiled and  bewildered  by  <i>maya</i>  or
illusory perceptions superimposed upon the mind.

The Supreme Lord Krishna is the original cause and source of  everything  in
existence. He is the ultimate bestower of all rewards for  all  actions  and
the final beatitude for those who have attained <i>moksa.</i> All  living  entities
and everything in creation emanate  from  Him  first.  The  purpose  of  His
divine appearances is exclusively for the benefit of mankind  by  protecting
the righteous and annihilating the unrighteous.
