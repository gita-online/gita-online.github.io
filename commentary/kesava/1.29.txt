It could be put forth that even if  there  is  no  reward  in  the  heavenly
planets there would still be royal luxuries and kingly  enjoyments  in  this
world for the slayer. To  refute  this  supposition  in  this  verse  Arjuna
declares <i>what use are these?</i>  The explanation  of  Arjuna  addressing   Lord
Krishna by the vocative  <i>Govinda</i>  indicates  that  since  the  Lord  is  the
possessor  of  eternal  existence,  consciousness  and  bliss,   Arjuna   is
imploring that the Lord should satiate him with  this  bliss.  In  the  word
<i>Govinda, go</i> stands for the senses and <i>vinda</i> stands for He who  attracts  and
directs the senses.  So  Arjuna  feeling  great  despair  contemplating  the
prospect of immense slaughter as a consequence of  war  is  requesting  Lord
Krishna to properly direct his senses for his ultimate benefit.
<p>
If it were to be submitted that even if Arjuna, being the son of  Pandu  and
Kunti had no desire for royal luxuries and kingly enjoyments, for  the  sake
of his relatives such desires are appropriate. This is neutralised  by  this
verse which stating that all those relatives for whose  sake  these  desires
would be appropriate are on the battlefield  ready  for  war.  Therefore  in
this context Arjuna has no need to fight.
<p>
It may be argued that even if Arjuna thinks of  them  as  relatives,  if  he
does not slay them, they will certainly slay  him.  So  Arjuna  should  slay
them all and rule over the entire kingdom.  To  refute  this  Arjuna  states
that he never desires to slay them, even if they wish to  slay  him.  Arjuna
addressing Lord Krishna with the vocative <i>Madhusudana</i>  is  giving  reference
to Lord Krishna terminating the  existence  of  a  demon  name  Madhu  in  a
previous time. The name is used to give credence  to  Arjuna's  position  by
illustrating as an example that  demons  are  to  be  exterminated  and  not
relatives.
<p>
Arjuna exclaims here that even for dominion of all the worlds he  would  not
wish to slay the sons of Dhritarastra,  let  alone  for  a  kingdom  on  the
earth. By addressing Lord Krishna with the  vocative  <i>Janardana</i>  meaning  He
who destroys the ignorance of His  devotees,  Arjuna  is  supplicating  Lord
Krishna to destroy his ignorance as well.
