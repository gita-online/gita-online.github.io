To answer the question how will yagna or worship fulfill oneâs
prayers Lord Krishna  reponds  that  the  devas  or  demi-gods
nourished by the  oblations  offered  will  in  turn  mutually
reciprocate fulfilling all oneâs prayers  with  properity  and
abundance. Gratifying  each other as such human and deva  will
all attain the fulfillment of their desires.
