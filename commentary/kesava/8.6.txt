Not only by thinking of Lord Krishna  alone  does  one  attain  His  eternal
nature; but whatever one thinks at the moment of death one  becomes  without
fail. This is  being  stated  with  the  words  <i>yam  yam</i>  meaning  whatever.
Whatever one is thinking at the last moment of death will transport  one  to
become the very object or  conception  one  contemplated  while  dying.  The
reason  Lord  Krishna  also   gives   with   the   words   <i>sada</i>   <i>tad-bhava-</i>
<i>bhavitah</i> meaning due to being completely absorbed in such contemplation  the
powerful prominence of the final thought and image infuses itself  upon  the
consciousness determining their next birth.
