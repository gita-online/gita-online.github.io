After the illustration of currents of  water  which  are  inanimate  in  the
previous verse,  Lord  Krishna  gives  an  illustration  of  animate  beings
referring to moths rushing into a blazing fire and being  destroyed  is  the
same as the mighty warriors of the Kaurava and  Pandava  armies  rushing  to
their destruction on the battlefield as depicted by  speedily  entering  the
flaming mouths of Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form.
