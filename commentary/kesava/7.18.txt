One may pose the question what about the other three types being  <i>artto</i>  the
aflicted, <i>atharthi</i> or those seeking wealth and <i>jnajinsuh</i>  or  those  seeking
<i>moksa</i> or liberation. Are they wretched and unworthy?  To  the  contrary  and
Lord  Krishna  confirms  this  with  the  word  <i>udarah</i>  meaning  noble   and
magnanimous. All these devotees are  noble  beings  who  have    accumulated
great merit in the course of tens of thousands of previous  births.  No  one
can become a devotee of Lord Krishna if they only have  a  small  amount  of
merit from previous lives. The devotees of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  have
such a surplus of accumulated merit due  to  having  practised  austerities,
undergone penance, performed yoga, engaged in  meditation,  offered  prayers
and given worship. That it is a natural  course  of  events  that  in  their
early lives they attain the opportunity to be Lord Krishna's devotee.   This
is confirmed and corroborated in the  Vedic  scriptures  by  the  statement:
Humans whose sins are expired cultivate devotion  to  Lord  Krishna.  Others
who still remain sinful never become Lord Krishna's devotee, they  only  can
worship Kali, Ganesh or some impersonal phantasm conception.  So  for  those
aspirants of the three  previous  types  who  have  the  tinge  of  fruitive
motivations, still they are the elect and after finally  achieving  devotion
to Him they become free from desire and qualified for  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
from the cycle of birth and death. Lord Krishna accepts  the  <i>jnani</i>  as  His
very self to exemplify their  exalted  position,  because  nothing  is  more
dearer then oneself. For the <i>jnani</i> is the elite  and  the  absolute  devotee
who is firmly established being time tested over a myriad of  lifetimes.  He
is wholeheartedly devoted to the Supreme Lord as his only  goal  another  of
which there is nothing superior and having such faith assuredly  arrives  at
that goal.
