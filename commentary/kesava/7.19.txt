The association with an advanced and  enlightened  devotee  of  the  Supreme
Lord is most difficult to achieve. This Lord Krishna indicates by the  words
<i>bahunam janmanam ante</i> meaning at the final cycle of innumerable births.  All
these  final  cycle  births  are  meritorious,  characterised  by  righteous
actions and noble activities which were numerous.  It  is  not  possible  to
achieve such  felicity  with  the  meagre  merits  acquired  from  righteous
activities throughout a single lifetime. To have  the  supreme  blessing  to
qualify for worshipping the Supreme Lord Krishna one must have  a  bountiful
surplus of meritorious activities over a myriad of lifetimes. Then  at  such
a time an enlightened being with overflowing love  and  complete  dedication
based on the true understanding of the goal of life, the means to attain  it
and how Lord Krishna is connected to both  as  the  omnipotent,  omniscient,
all pervading Supreme Being, worships Him with  all  their  body,  mind  and
heart. Lord Krishna should be known to be the source of the <i>Brahman</i>  or  the
spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  and  also  the  cause   of
creation, preservation and dissolution of  the  entire  material  existence.
The Chandogya Upanisad III.XIV.I states: All the demi-gods  that  have  come
to worship you, are actually also you because the creator of the  worlds  is
manifested from you. As the infinite is  omnipresent  the  Supreme  Lord  is
like that. An exalted being endowed with the discriminating  power  of  this
knowledge is <i>su-durlabah</i> meaning extremely  rare,  perhaps  only  one  among
millions of humans. It is stated in the Bhagavat  Purana:  Among  those  who
have attained <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the cycle of  birth  and  death  only
one of them out of millions is dedicated to the Supreme Lord Krishna.
