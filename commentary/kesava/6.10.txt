Such are the characteristics of a person situated in <i>yoga</i> or the science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness. Now Lord Krishna presents the process by which such  <i>yoga</i>  is
practised. The <i>yogi</i> is one perfecting <i>yoga</i> who  has  complete  control  over
their mind and senses and is free  from  desire  engaged  in  meditation  in
order to attain <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation  of  the  soul.  The  word  <i>ekaki</i>
means alone and the word <i>rahasi</i> means solitary  place.  One  should  perform
this <i>yoga</i> in seclusion by oneself in mountain caves or  forest  bowers  that
are not inhabited by others.
