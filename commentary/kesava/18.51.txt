<i>Bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion itself manifests the  Supreme  Lord  and
by <i>bhakti</i> alone He is revealed. Lord  Krishna  is  bound  by  the  love  and
devotion of His devotees. <i>Bhakti</i>  is  superior  to  everything  and  is  the
infallible means of attaining eternal communion with Him. Only by <i>bhakti</i>  is
it possible to comprehend the reality of Lord Krishna as He is,  who  He  is
and what He is in reality. Free from doubts, false  knowledge  and  illusion
by understanding His unlimited divine  attributes  and  His  endless  divine
qualities. One becomes blissfully attached  to  Him  through  the  causeless
mercy of His devotee and attaining His grace worships Him  exclusively  with
love and devotion. Such a devotee is always with Him  and  never  away  from
Him. Lord Krishna being completely subdued  by  fervent  love  and  devotion
never leaves the presence of such a devotee nor does the devotee ever  leave
Lord Krishna's presence. Every second of the day  In  all  aspects  of  life
such a  devotee  is  worshipping  Him  sometimes  internally  and  sometimes
externally and thus he abides in the Supreme Lord  and  the     the  Supreme
Lord abides in him. They are never apart from  each  other.  This  has  been
confirmed In chapter six, verse 30 which states: One who  sees  the  Supreme
Lord in everything  and  sees  everything  in  the  Supreme  Lord  is  never
separated from Him.
