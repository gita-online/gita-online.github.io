Nevertheless, as remarkable as it  may  seem,  all  created  beings  do  not
reside in the Supreme  Lord  like  liquefied  butter  attached  to  <i>ghee</i>  or
clarified butter because it is stated so in the Vedic  scriptures  that  the
<i>atma</i> or soul is  verily  separate  and  not  associated.  So  how  can  such
contradiction be reconciled. Lord Krishna states: <i>pasya  me  yogam  aisvaram</i>
or behold my divine supernatural power which is  extraordinarily  phenomenal
and which is beyond the scope of the human mind. So verily none  can  fathom
the Supreme Lord even conceptually because  He  is  factually  beyond  human
conception.  As for Him there  is  nothing  beyond  His  scope  because  His
divine supernatural power encompasses everything and  is  fully  capable  at
all times in accomplishing the  impossible  and  reconciling  perfectly  any
contradictions. How can He who is <i>bhuta-bhrt</i> or the maintainer  of  all  and
He who is <i>bhuta-bhavanah</i> or  the  protector  of  all  explain  in  what  way
existence is created? Lord Krishna states <i>na bhuta-stah</i> meaning He does  all
this without being associated with them. All this creation comes as  a  fiat
of His will in the form  of  consciousness.  This  is  corroborated  in  the
Taittiriya Upanisad II.VI which states: He merely desired that  there  would
be many and manifested creation.
