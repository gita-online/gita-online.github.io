Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal  form  is  being  described  as
<i>anadi-madhya-antam</i> meaning without beginning, middle  or  end  with  <i>ananta-</i>
<i>viryam</i> or unlimitedly powerful of infinite prowess  endowed  with  unlimited
arms, heads, faces and eyes which are equated to the sun and moon. The  cool
rays of the moon soothe and nourish  the  devotees  who  are  distraught  in
separation from the Supreme Lord. The scorching  heat  of  the  glowing  sun
punishes  and  chastises  the  demons  like  a  blazing  inferno  which   is
comparable to the fire at the time of universal destruction.
