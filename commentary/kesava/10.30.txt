Lord Krishna states that His <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental  opulence  is
<i>sarganam</i> or creation as the beginning, middle and ending.  In  verse  20  of
this chapter He revealed His <i>vibhuti</i> beginning, middle  and  ending  of  all
living entitiess by the word <i>bhutanam.</i> But  here  He  is  referring  to  the
insentient process that manifests as creation itself  for  the  benefit  and
welfare for all sentient beings. Of all knowledge  existing  Lord  Krishna's
<i>vibhuti</i> is <i>adhyatma-vidya</i> or the  supreme  knowledge  of  the  eternal  soul
which includes the Supreme Lord who  bestowed  its  eternality  and  how  to
attain His eternal association which is the paramount attainment.

Lord Krishna declares of the three methods of debate being <i>vadah, jalpa</i>  and
<i>vitanda</i> His <i>vibhuti</i> is  <i>vadah</i>  which  is  the  absolute  conclusive  reality
determined by the logical method of discussion and debate regarding the  pro
and cons of things by those who are established in <i>satya guna</i>  or  the  mode
of goodness in order to determine and ascertain the ultimate  truth  of  any
topic. Such beings are  always  free  from  passion  and  the  duplicity  of
subterfuge and deception.  <i>Jalpa</i>  is  the  method  of  argument  which  uses
calculated  criticism  and  superficial  suppositions  to   invalidate   the
opposition in an underhanded manner and is like  a  hedge  of  sharp  thorns
purposely keeping out any chance for a  conclusive  truth.  <i>Vitanda</i>  is  the
method of argument  which  uses  false  facts  and  absurd  affirmations  to
destroy an opponents position without having ever established a position  of
their own. The fallacy of <i>jalpa</i> and <i>vitanda</i>  is  that  they  falsify  facts,
distort truth and misrepresent reality for the purpose  of  inserting  their
own deceptive hidden agenda.
