Lord Krishna explains that He radiates  heat  by  the  sun  which  condenses
moisture over bodies of water and rises up and forms clouds which  He  sends
forth as rains in abundance in springtime according to the seasons of  every
location on the Earth. He is <i>amritam</i> or immortality as the life  force  that
appears at the conception of all living beings  and  which  departs  at  the
cessation of all living beings as such He is also <i>myrtuh</i>  or  death.  He  is
all  beings,  manifested  as  matter  and  unmanifested   as   spirit.   The
understanding is that according to their qualifications  the  <i>mahatmanas</i>  or
great beings know Lord  Krishna  as  the  internal  witness  of  all  living
entities and worship Him as the one supreme absolute truth or as a  specific
<i>avatar</i> or incarnation and expansion as revealed in the Vedic scriptures.
