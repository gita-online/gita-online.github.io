The doubt may be raised that it seems impossible to  perform  actions  as  a
doer while at the same time be indifferent to the  actions.  To  dispel  any
doubt and remove any contradiction Lord Krishna  states  the  compound  word
<i>mayadhyaksena</i> meaning as the superviser, controller or overseer of <i>maya</i>  the
illusory external energy  brings  forth  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence which consists of all creation and  all  moving
and non-moving living entities. The extent of His  involvement  is  to  keep
the wheel of creation  and  transmigration  of  all  living  being  enacting
perpetually being created again and again  continuously  in  cycles.  So  in
this manner there is not even the slightest contradiction or  necessity  for
doubt.
