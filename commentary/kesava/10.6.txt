Now Lord Krishna speaks on the benefits of knowing Him  in  reality  as  the
great sages spoken previously do, as  the  Supreme  transcendental  majestic
Lord of all. This is stated with the words <i>yo vetti tattvatah</i> meaning  those
who know  in  truth,  regarding  His  transcendental  potencies  and  divine
opulence and how they manifest, direst and sustain the whole creation.  Such
one's  like  the  great  sages  will  undoubtedly  become   established   in
undeviating <i>yoga</i> or the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion with the Ultimate Consciousness of the Supreme Lord.
