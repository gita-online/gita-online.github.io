Thus  after  describing  that  the  indiscrimate  and  unfortunate  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being who think  of  themselves  merely  as  a  material  body  and
erroneously believe they are the independent doer of  actions  are  ignorant
and of perverse, distorted  understanding  that  pollutes  their  mentality.
Whereas a person bereft of egoism possessed of proper understanding  is  not
tainted with the evil consequence of <i>karma</i> which binds one  so  perniciously
to <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death. One whose mind  has  been
purified through association with the Vaisnvas  and  instructions  from  the
Vedic scriptures from hearing the words of the Vaisnava spiritual master  no
longer consider themselves the doer of actions nor are  they  ever  attached
to the desire of  rewards  for  their  actions.  Such  evolved  beings  have
resolved that everything is completely dependent upon the Supreme  Lord  who
is  sustaining  and  energising  everything  and  is  the  sole  <i>isvara</i>  the
controller of all existence. Thus one has no conceptions of  I  will  do  or
this is mine or I will achieve, etc. and so forth. One who has achieved  the
true nature of the <i>atma</i>  the  immortal  soul  automatically  realises  their
eternal connection to the Supreme Lord Krishna. Such a  blessd  one  is  not
affected by material activities or influenced by worldly conceptions.  If  a
situation arises on its own accord where such a  one  must  perform  actions
they never think of themselves as the doer but  consider  that  the  Supreme
Lord is the doer of everything. Thus they are not fettered  to  actions  and
subsequently are not coerced to accept the resultant <i>karma</i> which forces  one
to experience the merits or demerits of actions.
