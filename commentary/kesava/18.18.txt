Now Lord Krishna describes the characteristics of the threefold  factors  of
knowledge, the knowable and the knower on the basis of the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or
modes of material nature. Knowledge as the object  of  all  actions  can  be
explained as that which gives knowledge. The knowable is one who  knows  the
means by which the action is accomplished. The knower is the one  performing
the  action.  These   three   are   the   essential   elements   and   their
characteristics and functions have been substantiated in the  philosophy  of
Sankhya or analytical knowledge by Lord Krishna's <i>avatar</i> of Kapila-deva  and
will be elaborated upon in the next three verses.
