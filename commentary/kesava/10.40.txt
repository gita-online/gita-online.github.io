<p><div align=justify>Thus presenting His principle vibhuti or divine, transcendental opulence
which relates to material existence in brief, Lord Krishna being more
concise includes them all in the previous verse. Now He concludes this
chapter with the words: kim jnatena tava meaning what is the need of
knowing all these facts separately. It is sufficient to know the reality
that Lord Krishna maintains the total material manifestation and upholds
the complete cosmic creation with just an infinitesimal spark of His
transcendental potency.  The two particles in athava of atha and va in the
first word of this verse meaning otherwise together express this point of
view. The word ekamsena means infinitesimal fraction. As it is declared by
Parasara in the Vishnu Purana: Lord Krishna from whom 1/10,000 part of
1/10,000 part which equals 1 percent of 100 million, maintains and sustains
the whole creation and cosmic manifestation. The entire material creation
containing the sentient and the non-sentient are all completely dependent
on Lord Krishna for their very existence. The understanding is to meditate
on everything as being a part of Him because nothing can exist without Him.

Taking complete refuge in the Supreme Lord Krishna who revealed His vibhuti
out of compassion for all beings, may bhakti or exclusive loving devotion
towards the Supreme Lord germinate and grow through  the knowledge of such
glories.
