Before Lord Krishna spoke of the merits of performing <i>yagna</i> or offerings  of
worship to propitiate the Supreme Lord. Now He will speak  of  the  demerits
accrued by failure to perform <i>yagna.</i> The key word is <i>ayagnasya</i>  which  means
for one who does not perform <i>yagna.</i> Without performing <i>yagna</i> in one  of  the
12 previously mentioned ways then even the meager joys  of  this  world  are
not available. If the pleasure of  mortals  in  this  world  which  is  very
limited is unavailable to those who do not perform <i>yagna</i> then  how  can  one
ever attain the higher planetary systems  where  pleasure  is  abundant  and
unlimited.
