Among the subduing power of rulers, Lord Krishna's vibhuti or divine,
transcendental opulence is the power of punishment that keeps the
wrongdoers in line. His vibhuti is that policy which leads to success. Of
secrets His vibhuti is maunam or silence which is inviolable being the
master of all secrecy and His vibhuti of the wise is the wisdom of those
who are self-realised.
