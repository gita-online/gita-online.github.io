The perfection of self-realisation  is  only  obtained  in  perfection  from
worshipping the Supreme Lord and offering everything one possesses  to  Him.
This can be also done by following one's natural  duties  without  deviation
as ordained in Vedic scriptures. All <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  manifested
from Lord  Krishna  who  is  omnipotent,  omniscient,  omnipresent  and  who
created, maintains and sustains everything in  all  creation  which  is  all
permeated solely by Him.
