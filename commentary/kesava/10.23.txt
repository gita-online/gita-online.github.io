Of  articulate  sound  vibrations  Lord   Krishna's   <i>vibhuti</i>   or   divine,
transcendental opulence is the monosyllable OM the root of all sound.  Among
<i>yagna</i> or propitiation and worship of the Supreme Lord, His <i>vibhuti</i> is  <i>japa-</i>
<i>yagno</i> or the devoted chanting of the Supreme Lord Krishna's holy  names.  Of
immovable mountains His <i>vibhuti</i> is the Himalaya mountains.
