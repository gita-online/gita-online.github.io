Until now Lord Krishna has been referring to <i>yogis</i> or  those  following  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness as being renunciates. Such a <i>yogi</i>  should  always  be
considered a renunciate as being impelled for  spiritual  knowledge  is  the
only motivation of action and thus being free  from  the  influence  of  all
dualities such as attraction and repulsion, happiness and distress,  such  a
<i>yogi</i> is not subject to likes and dislikes and is free from  <i>samsara</i>  or  the
cycle of birth and death easily without effort.
