But of all the previous four types Lord Krishna confirms that the  <i>jnani</i>  or
those of spiritual wisdom are the elite. The <i>jnani</i> excels the others and  is
superior by dint of their knowledge of the ultimate truth which  makes  them
<i>nitya-yukta</i> or eternally connected and <i>eka-bhaktir</i> or  continuously  focused
on the Supreme Lord. Like ordinary humans are exclusively attached to  their
family members, or as a poor man is exclusively attached to a rich  man  for
his maintenance. The <i>jnani</i> is not attached  to  others  nor  does  he  serve
others because they are  solely  possessed  of  exclusive  devotion  to  the
Supreme Lord in the forms of hearing  about,  speaking  about,  singing  to,
meditating on, worshipping and informing others. In the  Vishnu  Purana  the
prince Prahlad who recognised the Supreme  Lord  as  boundlessly  dear,  has
said: The unrelenting desire for objects of the senses  which the  sensually
attached possess; may that same never ending desire reside in  my  heart  to
always be devoted to the Supreme  Lord.  The  great  sage  Parasara  praised
Prahlad thus: With his mind  totally  absorbed  in  the  Supreme  Lord  when
Prahlad was bitten by poisonous serpents he did not feel a thing because  he
was immersed in remembering the Supreme Lord Krishna  who  swiftly  appeared
for his rescue as the incarnation Narasimha-deva.

It is declared in  the  Vedic  scriptures  that:  Devotion  is  serving  the
Supreme Lord Krishna with speech, mind,  body  and  activities  because  the
root <i>bhaja-bhajati</i> means to serve.  Therefore  the  spiritually  intelligent
have explained that <i>bhakti</i> or devotion is exclusive loving  service  to  the
Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  and  expansions
as revealed in the Vedic scriptures. If reference to  the  Supreme  Lord  is
not found to be revealed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  with  name,  form  and
qualities and pastimes; then  never  can  such  an  erroneous  and  illusory
conception of the  Supreme  Lord  be  ever  considered  to  be  factual  and
authentic.

To the enlightened devotees who know the reality  of  Lord  Krishna  as  the
Supreme Lord, He is extremely dear to them and they are also extremely  dear
to Him. It is also cited in the   Bhagavat  Purana  where  Narayana  states:
Just as parents are happy with their children, just as Rudra is  happy  with
his entourage and just as I am happy with Goddess Laxsmi; in  the  same  way
Lord Krishna's devotee is always extremely happy with Him. The Supreme  Lord
has nothing else dearer to Him then His loving devotees.
