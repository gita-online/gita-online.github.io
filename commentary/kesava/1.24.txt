In answer to the question what did Arjuna do next? Sanjaya  replies  with  a
mood to console the blind  Dhritarastra whose mind was visibly disturbed  by
the doubt that his son Duryodhana might not be victorious but  could  indeed
lose the entire kingdom.  Dhritarastra  previously  had  not  the  slightest
intention of giving back to the  Pandavas,  the  children  of  his  deceased
brother Pandu, their rightful share of the kingdom. Then when  the  Pandavas
had to suffer further miseries in the forest for 13 years  did  he  consider
giving them a reprieve. But in the process of undergoing various trails  and
tribulations of forest life, Arjuna received many divine weapons  from  Siva
and Indra and his mighty Gandiva bow  bestowed  upon  him  by  Agni.  Arjuna
although being protected by Lord Krishna and fully capable of defeating  the
belligerent warriors of the Kaurava army when he saw so many of  his  family
and friends arrayed against him he became overwhelmed  with  compassion  for
them.

One might wonder how is it possible that just before battle  such  a  mighty
warrior as Arjuna is  smitten  so  untimely  with  feelings  of  compassion.
Arjuna is being referred to as <i>Kaunteya</i> the son of Kunti who is the  exalted
sister of Vasudeva who Lord Krishna accepted as His father. Vasudeva was  so
magnanimous and compassionate that he forgave Kamsa  who  was  an  incurable
sinner. So feeling some pity for  them  Arjuna  forlornly  spoke  the  words
found in the next verse.
