Although by reflection it  can  be  clearly  understood  that  the  soul  is
indestructible and not to be lamented for; yet and still the  physical  body
is destructible. With the termination in battle of the physical  body  of  a
very dear one such as preceptor, protector  or  loved  ones  the  seperation
from whom will undoubtedly cause deep lamentation. To categorically  clarify
this misusage Lord Krishna explains that just as there is no grief when  one
discards old worn out garments and there is joy at  accepting  new  garments
in the same way the embodied soul discarding  old worn out  bodies  joyfully
accepts new ones.  So if preceptors like Bhisma  were to lose their body  in
this war of  righteousness  then  they  would   receive  a  new  and  better
physical body in their next life and it would be  beneficial  for  them  and
not unfavorable.
