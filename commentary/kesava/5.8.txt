How would the  performer  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  prescribed  Vedic  activities
without attachment who has achieved <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of  the  soul
behave? Lord Krishna replies to this in these two verses. The  <i>yogi</i>  or  one
following the science of the individual  consciousness  attaining  communion
with the ultimate consciousness comprehends  the  reality  that  all  bodily
functions along with the senses are functioning independently and  thus  one
is not subject  to  conceptions  of  doership.  Seeing,  hearing,  smelling,
tasting and touching are the functions of the eyes, ears, nose,  tongue  and
body. When the eyes open and close does one think they are  the  opener  and
closer? In this way one should think for all actions  one  performs.  Moving
is the function of  the  legs,  speaking  of  the  mouth,  pleasure  of  the
generating organs and so forth. Breathing is a function of the  vital  force
and includes all others  as  it  sustains  the  entire  body.  Lord  Krishna
explains this exposition in the way of <i>artha-krama</i> or  where  the  order  of
the meaning is  more  potent  than  <i>patha-krama</i>  or  textual  position.  The
purport is that one should live their life free from the ego of  I-ness  and
my-ness and conceptions of  doership,  knowing  that  all  actions  are  the
functions of the organs and senses and are independent from  the  individual
consciousness.
