Beholding the resplendent Supreme Lord Krishna in all His glory before  him,
Arjuna out of extreme expressions of devotion salutes the Supreme Lord  with
praises such as <i>ananta-virya</i> or unlimited personality and <i>amita-vikramah</i>  or
immeasurably powerful and humbly offers Him obeisance from  all  directions.
He also states that Lord Krishna pervades the total creation because  it  is
an extension of Him therefore He is everything  in  existence.  Due  to  His
attributes of omnicsience and omnipresence it is  clearly  established  that
Lord Krishna Himself is <i>paramatma</i> or the Supreme eternal soul pervading  all
creation and all living entities for the collective total of every  <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul of all living entities constitutes His  divine,  transcendental
spiritual body and which also contains  what  appears  to  be  inanimate  as
well. This proves that the material creation is not just an illusory  mirage
that  is  not  factual   adhered  to  by  the  <i>mayavadis</i>  or   the   pseudo-
impersonalists who do not  believe  that  the  Supreme  Lord  has  unlimited
qualities, phenomenal attributes and wonderfully, sublime personality.
