Thus Lord Krishna previously described that created beings from the  highest
material planet <i>Maharloka</i> of Brahma  down  to  the  lower  heavenly  planets
called <i>Mahat</i> are all  subjected to rebirth in the  material  existence.  Now
He explains that the creation and dissolution of  all  the  material  worlds
like Earth, the galaxy, our solar system, all the universes up  through  the
heavenly planets  to the topmost planet of <i>Maharloka</i>  are  all  created  and
absorbed back into the <i>avyakta</i> or  the  unmanifest  which  is  regulated  by
Brahma's day and night each comprised of 4 billion 320 million years.
<p>
All sentient beings in physical existence were created by  Brahma  from  his
subtle body. This subtle body is one of the transformations of  <i>prakriti</i>  or
the material substratum pervading physical existence.  This  the  unmanifest
is from Brahma and is within material existence although  super  subtle  and
from which emanates countless myriad  of  unlimited  beings  accompanied  by
their respective bodies and minds and  senses  with  which  to  enjoy  their
respective activities and pleasures. This happens at the dawning of  Brahmas
day when he awakes.  At the closing of Brahma's day  and  the  beginning  of
his night all beings who emanated from his subtle body are  withdrawn  again
into his subtle body to repose in dormancy until his awakening  again  after
4 billion 320 million years.
