Lord Krishna abides within the physical bodies  of  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings as <i>vaisvanara</i> the digestive fire which joining with  the  vital  airs
of <i>prana</i> or exhalation and <i>apana</i> or inhalation, digest  the  four  kinds  of
food that are chewed, sucked, licked and drank. This is  also  confirmed  in
the  Brhadaranyaka  Upanisad   V.IX.I   beginning   <i>ayamagnirvaisvanaro   yo</i>
<i>ayamantah puruse</i> meaning: From the <i>purusa</i> or Supreme Lord comes the fire  of
digestion known as <i>vaisvanara</i> by which food that is eaten is digested.
