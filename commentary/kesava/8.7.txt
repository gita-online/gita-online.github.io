So the reality being that the attainment of a particular cherished  goal  in
the next life is determined and destined by constant contemplation  upon  it
has been duly revealed by Lord Krishna. As Arjuna is a worthy  aspirant  for
<i>moksa</i> or liberation from  material  existence  he  is  being  instructed  to
judiciously  think  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  with  every  action  he
performs. This is what  is  being  indicated  by  the  word  <i>tasmat</i>  meaning
therefore. The reason is that whatever thoughts the mind is set upon due  to
habituation it remains fixed to at the moment when death  arises.  Therefore
one should set their mind  on  Lord  Krishna,  the  Supreme  controller  and
bestower of all boons at all times. At the same time  one  should  carefully
avoid all sins in the form of neglecting to perform one's obligatory  duties
and occasional duties ordained by the injunctions of  the  Vedic  scriptures
according to <i>varnasrama</i> or ones position and rank in society. Arjuna  was  a
<i>ksatriya</i> or warrior who was from the royal class and  it  was  his  duty  to
protect righteousness in the world. With our minds and will being free  from
impurity  by  performing  natural  occupational  duties  accordingly   being
unconditionally devoted to the Supreme Lord, we will attain  Him  without  a
doubt.
