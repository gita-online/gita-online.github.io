Thus Lord Krishna concludes this chapter stating the results of
ascertaining the intrinsic meaning of the answers to the eight questions
asked by Arjuna. The yogi or one perfecting the science of the individual
consciousness attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness having
devotion for the Supreme Lord eclipses all. Such a being fully realising
the intrinsic truths revealed in the answers given by Lord Krishna to these
eight questions and understands the absolute supremacy of the Supreme Lord
surpasses in achievement all the pious merits of those who are devoted to
study and reflection of the Vedas, those who perform ritualistic Vedic
activities for rewards, those who engage in severe austerities and penance
and those who give much charity to others. Such a yogi understands that
material goals only lead to temporary rewards and that all meritorious
activities performed with any attachment or desire assuredly propels one
back into physical existence endlessly. The conclusion is that for such a
yogi it is the Supreme Lord Himself that is the only goal and as He is the
only goal such a one attains the Supreme Lords and has eternal association
with Him in His transcendental abode in the spiritual worlds.
