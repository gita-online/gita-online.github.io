In the previous verse Lord Krishna declares that those that truly  know  Him
attain Him. Now the  question  may  be  raised  is  there  any  requirements
necessary for attaining Him or does it mean that oneness  with  Him  in  His
abode transpires automatically with knowledge of Him. To clear this up  Lord
Krishna  states:  <i>vita-raga-bhaya-krodha</i>  meaning  completely   freed   from
passion, fear and anger. Passion is  attachment  to  the  opposite  sex  and
children and family life. Fear is abhorrence of frightening  situations  due
to lack of faith in God. Anger is a state of mind that blows up  when  one's
ardent desires are frustrated by  obstacles.  This  clearly  indicates  that
<i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of knowledge is  essential  for  the  mind  to
control the senses. In the Visnusahasra 136 it is given that:  the  physical
body,  the  senses,  the  mind,  the  intellect,  the  vitality,  splendour,
potency, patience, and the <i>atma</i> or soul  all  are  the  possessions  of  the
Supreme Lord. The very knowledge of the Supreme  Lords  transcendental  <i>nama</i>
or names, <i>rupa</i> or forms, <i>guna</i> or attributes, <i>lila</i> or pastimes and  <i>dhama</i>  or
abode is the <i>tapasya</i> or penance which dissolves all <i>karmas</i> or  reactions  to
previous actions. Thus wholly absorbed  internally  and  externally  in  the
wonderful and  phenomenal  Supreme  Lord  one  naturally  attains  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation with Him. Although there are different forms  accepted  when  one
attains the state  of  <i>moksa</i>  these  elevated  beings  attain  oneness  with
differences or union with separateness. They are  united  because  they  all
have attributes like omniscience and <i>ananda</i> or bliss. Yet they are  separate
due to  differences  in  qualities  having  their  own  unique,  individual
spiritual characteristics. The  great  sage  Pantajali  of  the  <i>hatha  yoga</i>
system defines oneness as union with differences. In this way the  statement
of oneness of similar qualities in the state of <i>moksa</i>  has  been  explained.
There are two realities: one is the reality  of  oneness  in  form  and  the
other is the reality of difference in forms. The absence  of  difference  of
the individual <i>atma</i> or soul from the  <i>paramatma</i>  or  the  supreme  soul  has
already been refuted in chapter II.XIII by the plural  usage  of  souls  and
concludes with the words <i>dhiras tatra na  muhyati</i>  meaning  the  intelligent
are not deluded by this.
