It can be seen that  Lord  Krishna's  two-fold  potency  consisting  of  the
inferior external energy and the superior internal energy  as  described  in
chapter seven, verse five is non-different  from  the  <i>ksetra</i>  or  filed  of
activity and the <i>ksetra-jna</i> the knower of the field of activity.  Here  Lord
Krishna refers to matter as <i>prakriti</i> or the  material  substratum  pervading
physical existence and <i>purusa</i> or the supreme eternal spirit of  all  as  the
<i>atma</i> or immortal soul are both beginingless and attached to each other  from
time immemorial. It should be understood that <i>prakriti</i> is the lower form  of
existence known as the <i>ksetra</i>  which  is  insentient  containing  the  three
modes  of  material  nature  and  is  the  cause  of  all  modification  and
transformations on the physical  plane  of  existence.  The  <i>purusa</i>  is  the
higher potency of existence  known  as  the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>  and  is  completely
different in nature being sentient.  Both  are  beginningless  and  have  no
cause due to the fact they are both potencies of the Supreme Lord  and  thus
they themselves are their own cause. It is not possible for any other  prime
cause to exist other than the Supreme Lord  and  an  endless  succession  of
causes and effects makes such a hypothesis untenable. There is  no  need  to
discuss the position of the <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul  as  it  is  eternal  and
unborn. The  Katha  Upanisad  I.II.XVIII  beginning  <i>na  jayate  mriyate  va</i>
meaning: The <i>atma</i> is never born neither does it ever die. Nor  is  the  <i>atma</i>
ever subject to any modifications or transformations  of  <i>prakriti</i>  such  as
attraction and aversion, desire and repulsion, etc. which are the  cause  of
endless bondage to the <i>jiva</i> or embodied self. Also the  20  super  excellent
virtues given in verses 8 to  12  commencing  with  reverence  and  humility
which become the cause of  liberation  through  knowledge  also  arise  from
<i>prakriti.</i> The  purport  is  that  matter  is  constituted  of  beginningless
actions while  insentient  by  modification  force  the  <i>jiva</i>  to  endlessly
revolve in <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle  of  birth  and  death.  Yet  this
matter when possessing the super excellent virtues  of  spiritual  endowment
can liberate the <i>jiva</i> as well.
