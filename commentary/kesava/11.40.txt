Lord Krishna's supreme, transcendental glory and  infinite  might  is  being
proclaimed as the progenitor and maintainer  of  all  creation  filled  with
animate beings and inanimate objects. In all levels of  existence  there  is
nothing equal to the Supreme Lord Krishna individually or  collectively.  So
it is clear that nothing is  greater  than  Him  in  the  present,  nor  was
anything greater than Him in the past and neither will anything  be  greater
than Him in the future.
