Lord Krishna now answers the question of how one  situated  in  transcendent
consciousness speaks. He does this by explaining that one who is  unattached
to  everything  without  a  mental  inclination  towards  anything   totally
indifferent to all sense objects. When exposed to sources of  pleasure  like
mouth watering vegetable preperations,  delicious  nectarian  fruit  drinks,
silky, fashionable clothes or luxurious homes such a one  does  not  rejoice
at receiving these things nor give  praise  to  those  who  have  bequeathed
these things. Similarly when  exposed  to  sources  of  unpleasantness  like
unpalatable food and drink, coarse unfashionable clothes  and  humble  homes
such a one does not show disdain and is indifferent to  statements  made  by
people to criticise him such as being called a pseudo yogi or  a  hypocrite.
Thus the essence is such a one uses his words sparsely, praises no  one  and
blames no one and because he possesses  neither  love  nor  hatred  for  any
living  being  benefits  all.  Such  a  one  is  situated  in   transcendent
consciousness.
