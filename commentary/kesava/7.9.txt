Lord Krishna is stating that He is the subtle principle of fragrance  innate
within the Earth. The particle <i>ca</i>  meaning  and  includes  after  smell  the
other four subtle principles such as taste, touch, sight and  sound.  He  is
the pure brilliance in fire. He is the vital  life  force  in  all  sentient
beings and He is the potency of  austerities  in  the  ascetics  and  forest
dwellers giving them the power to endure in their penance  to  overcome  the
dualities such as cold and heat.
