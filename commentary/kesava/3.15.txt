It should be known  that  actions  have  its  origins  in  the
Brahman meaning the Vedas. Lord Krishna by stating the Brahman
wants  to  emphasise  the  all-pervading  substratum  of   all
existence that is revealed by the Vedas  and transforming from
the mantras of the Vedas, the actions prescribed by the Vedas,
the forces of nature, sun and clouds and rain, food and living
beings. Although nature is seen as a force of action  actually
it is supported fully by the underlying energy of the  Supreme
Brahman. Actions though appearing to have a force of their own
are only manifested through the instrument of matter in humans
it is the physcial body.  The  Vedas  as  has  been  described
earlier emanated from the imperishable Supreme  Brahman,  Lord
Krishna.  The  words  sarva-gatam   means   all-pervading   or
indestructible. This is indicative of the Supreme  Brahman  as
well as the soul within every living entity. The soul is known
to be indestructible and all pervading. Through  the  auspices
of the soul the physical body through  the  manifestations  of
nature partakes of food and gains strength  becoming  fit  for
performing actions authorised by the Vedas. The word  udbhavan
meaning originates  from  is  used  to  illustrate  that  this
fitness comes from the source from which one  manifests  from.
Even nature is  only  able  to  operate  from  the  substratum
through the utilisation of sun, rain, wind, fire etc.  and  by
no other means. Therefore the all pervading and indestructible
atma or soul utilises a physical body which is its  substratum
in the same way as the material nature to perform actions  and
that  without  a  physical   body  performing  the  activities
prescribed  in  the  Vedas,  then  yagna  or  worship  is  not
possible.
