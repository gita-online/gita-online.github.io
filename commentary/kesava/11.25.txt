The Supreme Lord Krishna was requested by Arjuna in verse 25 with  the  word
<i>prasida</i> meaning be merciful and grace him to be free  from  fear;  yet  Lord
Krishna exhibited His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form  to  indicate  that
there was nothing to fear for His devotees and that the battle  of  the  two
armies and  the  whole  material  manifestation  was  completely  under  His
control. The <i>visvarupa</i>  was  revealed  to  assure  Arjuna  of  his  definite
victory and resultant fame by the Pandavas victory over the  Kauravas.  This
victory arranged and orchestrated by Lord Krishna was to rid the  burden  on
Earth of the Kauravas along with other demons in  the  guise  of  kings  who
were slain previously during the great war with the  demigods  and  had  now
taken rebirth again  as  millions  of  warriors  dispersed  throughout  both
armies. In verse seven Lord Krishna  told  Arjuna  that  he  could  see  any
reality he would want to see in the <i>visvarupa</i>  and  now  he  is  seeing  his
enemies defeat and his own victory which would soon  transpire.  Duryodhana,
Bhishma who was educated in the heavenly planets,  Drona  who  had  received
divine weapons from Parasurama, Karna the son  of  Surya  the  sungod  along
with the principle warriors on the Pandava side such  as  Dhristadyumna  and
Sikhandi are all seen rushing headlong directly into the innumerable  mouths
of the <i>visvarupa</i> where they are gnashed by the fearsome teeth and perish.
