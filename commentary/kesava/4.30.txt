<i>Yogis</i> or  those  following  the  science  of  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the  ultimate  consciousness  enjoy  the  ambrosial
nectar of the remnants left over in the  time  period  after  the  <i>yagna</i>  or
offerings of worship are completed. The compound word <i>sista-amrta</i> refers  to
the remains of nectar after  <i>yagna.</i>  Through  purity  of  mind  followed  by
acquisition of knowledge one realises the eternal <i>Brahman</i> or  the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. This is the explanation given  by  those
that do not follow  <i>Vaisnavism</i>  or  the  knowledge  that  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna and His authorised incarnations are the ultimate goal of  the  Vedic
scriptures. According to the Vedic doctrine of  <i>Vaisnavism</i>  when  the  <i>yogis</i>
perform the previously mentioned <i>yagnas</i> without desire all  their  sins  are
absolved first and then they enjoy the remnants of offerings to the  Supreme
Lord because <i>yagna</i> itself is verily the Supreme Lord as well. They  eat  the
transcendental food which is known as <i>amrta</i> or nectar because  it  has  been
spiritualised by the performance of <i>yagna</i> to the Supreme  Lord  and  realise
the <i>Brahman.</i> The Supreme Lord Krishna's expansion Narayana revealed  in  the
Skanda Purana that those devoted to Him should only  partake  of  food  that
was already offered to Him. Such food has the power to  purify  one  of  all
sins and leads to <i>moksa</i> or liberation form the material existence.  One  who
partakes every meal, each day of the food offered to  the  Supreme  Lord  as
duly  offered  by  the  Vaisnavas  and  Brahmins  according  to  the   Vedic
scriptures receives inexhaustible merit.  Each  morsel  of  such  sanctified
food is worth 100 such vows as that practised from the new moon to the  full
moon given previous in verse 28. The Skanda  Purana  also  gives  the  harsh
demerits of one who does not eat sanctified food that was first  offered  to
the Supreme Lord. The Skanda Purana reveals that  there  are  two  types  of
food suitable for eating. One is food that was duly offered to  the  Supreme
Lord and the second is the remnants of the food partaken after the  devotees
of the Supreme Lord have eaten from His offerings. The third  type  of  food
is the food that was not offered to the Supreme Lord  before  partaking  and
that should never be eaten by one desiring there own best welfare.  One  who
eats and drinks food and beverages  that  were  not  first  offered  to  the
Supreme Lord verily the food is equal to excreta and the drink is  equal  to
urine. Therefore the conclusion is for one to ponder and that  is:  How  can
there ever be nectar and the realisation of the <i>Brahman</i> and  the  attainment
of  <i>moksa</i>  for those who eat food not first  offered  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna.
