Lord  Krishna  continues  to  confirm  His  Supreme  Lordship  and  absolute
dominion over all that exists in  creation  this  verse  and  the  next  two
beginning  with  the  words  <i>buddhir  jnanam  asammohah.  Buddhir</i>  spiritual
intelligence to determine what is real and what is  unreal.  <i>Jnanam</i>  is  the
power of discrimination regarding the <i>atma</i> or  eternal  soul  and  temporary
physicality. <i>Asammohah</i> is the absence of illusion about the spiritual  goal.
<i>Ksama</i> is tolerance even in situations where agitation is natural. <i>Satyam</i>  is
the truthfulness of relating about something as  it  exactly  is.  <i>Damah</i>  is
restraint of the senses withdrawing the sense  organs  from  sense  objects.
<i>Samah</i> is control of the mind keeping it away from  unproductive  unrighteous
thinking and having it focused on the Supreme Lord.  <i>Sukham</i>  is  joyful  and
<i>duhkham</i> is sorrowful.  <i>Bhavah</i>  is  evolution  and  <i>abhavah</i>  is  dissolution.
<i>Bhayam</i> is fear of oncoming difficulties  and  <i>abhayam</i>  is  free  from  fear.
<i>Ahimsa</i> is abstaining from harming  any  being  by  mind,  speech  and  body.
<i>Samata</i>  is  not  succumbing  to  passion  and  hatred.  <i>Tustih</i>  is   feeling
contentment from whatever comes  on  its  own  accord.  <i>Tapah</i>  is  voluntary
austerities for spiritual purposes according to  the  Vedic  scriptures  and
will be more clearly enunciated in chapter VIII.XIV-XVII. <i>Danah</i> is  offering
honestly earned funds to an auspicious person, in an auspicious place at  an
auspicious time. <i>Yaso</i>  is  the  recognition  arising  from  appreciation  of
possessing righteous virtues like compassion and generosity.  So  like  this
these qualities and their opposites are the individual traits of all  humans
and which all emanate to them from the Supreme Lord alone, in accordance  to
their respective actions and merits.
