Extolling the topic of highest wisdom  to  be  presented  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna glorifies it in this verse and the next differentiating it  as  more
advanced then what He had discoursed previously. This is in  regard  to  the
by products of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence which are the <i>gunas</i> or three modes of  material  nature  known  as
<i>sattva guna</i> or mode of goodness, <i>raja guna</i> or mode of passion and <i>tama  guna</i>
or mode of ignorance. By acquiring this wisdom  and  imbibing  it  into  the
consciousness the great <i>munayah</i> or sages and seers ascended to  the  highest
felicity and achieved  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material  existence  and
release from <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of birth and death.
