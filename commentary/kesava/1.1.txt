<p><div align=justify>The Supreme Lord Krishna in order to  mitigate  Arjuna's  lamentation  tells
him that he grieves for that which is not worthy of sorrow in answer to  the
cause of Arjuna woes as has been described in the first chapter which  began
by the blind Dhrtarastra inquiring about his hoped  for  sons  victory;  yet
internally in doubt due to Arjunas  unsurpassable  valour  revealed  in  his
aquisition of divine weapons by satisfying Shiva, also this was proved  when
Arjuna defeated the Gandharvas  and  released  Duryodhana  even  though  the
latter had come to cause he and  his  brothers  mischief,  also  by  Arjunas
removing of  the  Kauravas  crowns  and  ornaments  when  he  defeated  them
recapturing the cowherd of the king at the city of Virata. All these  events
flashed through Dhritarastra's mind and with a heavy heart he asked  Sanjaya
who had  been  bequeathed  with  clairvoyance  byVedavyasa  giving  him  the
capacity to envision everything that was happenning on  the  battlefield  of
Kuruksetra between the army of his sons the Kauravas and  the  army  of  the
Pandavas.
<p>
The Mahabharata records these events from a conversation  between  the  holy
sage Vaisampayana and  Arjunas  great-grandson  Janamejaya  and  begins  the
Bhagavad-Gita  with  <i>Dhritarastra  spoke.</i>  In  this  very  first  verse  the
question is placed within the sentence thus: <i>In the holy land of  Kuruksetra</i>
<i>what did my sons and the sons of Pandu desiring  battle  do?</i>  Kuruksetra  is
the place of the origin of <i>dharma</i> or  righteousness.  The  Vedic  scriptures
declare  that  Kuruksetra  is  a  place  for   performing   sacrifice.   Its
signifigance is well known and recorded. All  through  the  ages  Kuruksetra
has been a place for performing sacrifice, sacred and holy,  resided  at  by
the Brahma-rishis. Those who depart this world at Kuruksetra should  not  be
grieved  for  under  any  circumstances.   The   suggested   question   that
Dhritarastra is inwardly posing is whether or not  his  sons  observing  the
powerful warriors in the enemy ranks  such  as  the  mighty  Bhima  and  the
intrepid Arjuna  who is a perfect master in the use  of  celestial  weapons,
were still determined to fight  or  reconsidering  did  they  give   up  all
thoughts of warfare and instead call a truce and make a peace settlement.
<p>
The phrase <i>dharma-ksetra kuru-ksetra</i>  used  by  Dhritarastra  signifies  two
things. The first is that he is inwardly thinking that his sons who are  not
righteous  might  give  back  the  kingdom  to  the  Pandavas   which   they
appropriated  by  fraudulent  means,  due  to  being   influenced   by   the
righteousness and holy acts of sanctity performed in  sacred  sacrifice  for
the satisfaction of Bhrigu Muni and as well as the potent act  of  atonement
performed by avatar Parasurama which He offered on five altars as  expiation
for his fathers death. The second  is that  Dhritarastra  was  contemplating
that  Kuruksetra being the the place where <i>dharma</i> originated  is  inherently
powerfully potent in virtue and  righteousness.  If  the  Pandavas  who  are
virtuous by nature,  increase in  righteousness  due  to  contact  with  the
holiness of Kuruksetra and thereby lose all desire in regaining the  kingdom
after duly weighing the sinful consequences of  slaying  their  kinsman  and
relatives then I would be very pleased with them.
