<p><div align=justify>Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form is specifically  mentioned
as being adorned  with  unlimited  diadems,  unlimited  sceptres,  unlimited
flaming discs and unlimited accoutrements. A beaming  bright  lustre  in  an
effulgent mass of splendour. The <i>visvarupa</i> has the radiance of blazing  fire
and dazzling sunlight making it difficult to gaze  upon  and  impossible  to
discern its immeasurable appearance.
