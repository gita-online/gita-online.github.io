The spiritually intelligent saintly beings who  perform  the  before  stated
instructions, who  perceive  things  with  discrimination  and  chant  Vedic
authorised mantras, who have refrained from all sinful  actions  leading  to
inevitable reactions by the practice of selfless actions without  desire  or
attachment, whose doubts have been vanquished  by  the  sword  of  spiritual
knowledge and who mercifully are  active  for  the  benefit  of  all  living
entities. Lord Krishna reveals that such beings attain freedom from  <i>samsara</i>
or the perpetual cycle of birth and death by realisation of the  <i>Brahman</i>  or
spiritual substratum pervading all existence.
