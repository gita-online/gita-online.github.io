The devotees of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  do  not  have  to  undergo  any
tribulations or difficulties in order to reach Him quickly. This is what  He
confirms in these two verses beginning with the  words  <i>ye  tu</i>  meaning  but
those who denotes those whose parents were conscious of Lord Krishna at  the
time of the infants very conception by which receiving such grace they  were
born devotees of the Supreme Lord or  by  destiny  or  <i>karma</i>  being  actions
awarded based on previous actions, such  beings  acquire  association  of  a
pure devotee of Lord Krishna and are blessed by them. Such  fortunate  <i>jivas</i>
or embodied beings depend exclusively upon the Supreme Lord  because  He  is
absolutely the ultimate goal to  be  attained  above  all  others  in  every
situation  and  in  all  circumstances.  Such  blessed  beings   are   fully
surrendered to the Supreme Lord, devoting their very lives for His  complete
satisfaction without motive or thought of recompense and  reward  for  their
activities. Even while engaged in worldly  activities  for  preservation  of
bodily maintenance for self and family such as food and shelter as  well  as
performing Vedically ordained activities  according  to  <i>varnasrama</i>  or  the
four social order of Vedic society  such  as  propitiation  to  the  Supreme
Lord, charity, etc.  such  surrendered  beings  continuously  remember  Lord
Krishna as their most beloved and single  object  of  adoration,  reflecting
again and again incessantly over His  <i>rupa</i>  or  divine  form,  His  <i>guna</i>  or
divine qualities, His <i>lilas</i> or divine pastimes, His <i>dhama</i>  or  divine  abode
and <i>madhurya</i> or His divine transcendental sweetness. For  such  great  souls
Lord Krishna declares that He Himself becomes their saviour  and  personally
delivers  them  from  <i>mrtyu-samsara-sagarat</i>  or  the  deadly  ocean  of  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death and this He  declares  that  He  does  <i>na</i>
<i>cirat</i> meaning without delay.
<p>
The conclusion is that by continuously offering their hearts  and  minds  in
uninterrupted <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna, He becomes indebted to them so much so that He personally goes  and
rescues them from <i>samsara,</i> the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death  and
promotes them to  the  immortal  spiritual  worlds  to  eternally  share  in
exclusive blissful communion with Him
