Now Lord Krishna speaks of His paramount position over  everything  and  His
superiority over all. Because He  is  the  origin  of  the  dual  nature  of
<i>prakriti</i> the material substratum, He Himself is factually the substratum  of
everything existing and the source of  the  entire  creation.  There  is  no
independent power or cause for all of creation other than Him. Lord  Krishna
is the Supreme Lord  of  all  and  this  is  clear  everything  animate  and
inanimate in  all  of  creation  evolves  from  Him.  The  Vedic  scriptures
proclaim of Lord Krishna thus: There is nothing  equal  to  Him  neither  is
there anything superior to Him. He is the source of all sources. He  is  the
controller of all controllers. He is the  Lord  of  all  lords.  He  is  the
origin of the creator of creation. He is the Supreme Being above  all  other
beings. The Ruler of the unmanifest and the manifest.  By the will  of  Lord
Krishna the entire creation of unlimited movable  and  immovables  has  been
manifested.

Now  Lord  Krishna  reveals  He,  Himself  is  the  ultimate  substratum  of
everything. The metaphor given are the words  <i>sutre  mani-gana  iva</i>  meaning
clusters of gems strung on a thread.  The stableness  and  movement  of  the
gems is depending upon the thread and in the  same  way  the  stability  and
movement of the entire creation comprised of the animate  and  inanimate  is
depending upon Lord Krishna  who  resides  as  <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme  Soul
within all sentient beings. This means that their life  and  activities  are
dependent solely on Him even though possessing free will. It  is  stated  in
the Vedic scriptures  that: The  Supreme  Lord  encompasses  internally  and
externally everything that is seen or heard. Also it is  stated:  Intellect,
mind, universal intelligence, wind,  fire,  earth  and  the  four  types  of
beings:
1) engendered by form
2) viviparous or engendered by egg
3) engendered by sprouting
4) engendered by heat and moisture
All these four types of beings have their as source Lord Krishna.
