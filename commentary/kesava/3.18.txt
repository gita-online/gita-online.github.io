Lord Krishna has declared  previously that  the  performer  of
yagna prospers and flourishes and the ommiter of  yagna  fails
to prosper and flourish but now He confirms that in this world
the knower of atma-tattva or soul realisation has no need  for
prosperity or necessity for performing any  action  precsribed
in the Vedas; nor is there any fault or defect in the ommision
of any such action. What is done or what is not  done  is  all
the same to the perfectly  equiposed  realised  being  because
such a person is indifferent to everything except the  eternal
soul within which is the only medium to the Supreme Lord. Thus
completely satisfied within such a person has no dependance on
any living being including the demi-gods.  The purport is that
such a person depends on nothing from anyone  because  such  a
person has no desire for anything from any being.
