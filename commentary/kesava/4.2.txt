Thus  was  transmitted  from  Lord  Krishna  a  distinguished  <i>parampara</i>  or
disciplic succession  from  illustrious  father  to  illustrious  son.  This
knowledge was passed onto the saintly kings and royal sages  like  Nimi  and
Sagara; but its origins are without beginning because its roots are  in  the
eternal  Vedas.  By  great  efflux  of  time  and   degradation   of   human
intelligence limiting qualified recipients this great knowledge  disappeared
into oblivion due to a break in <i>parampara</i> causing a discontinuation  of  the
tradition in this world.
