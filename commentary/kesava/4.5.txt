Lord Krishna  understanding  Arjuna's  intention  in  posing  this  question
explains  that  many  births  have  passed  meaning  that  they  have   both
experienced many bodily manifestations. Lord Krishna is aware  of  them  all
as well as all other living beings because His  knowledge  is  complete  and
omniscient but Arjuna's knowledge is veiled as  well  as  all  other  living
entities.
