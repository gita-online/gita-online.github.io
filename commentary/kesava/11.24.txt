Seeing Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine  universal  form  with  terrifying
teeth  and  unlimited  mouths  blazing  conflagrations  like  the  fires  of
annihilation at the time of universal  destruction.  Arjuna  totally  losing
his equilibrium was unable to discern in which direction were the  meridians
north, south, east and west. He beseeches Lord Krishna with the words  <i>deva-</i>
<i>isa</i> or O' Lord of lords and <i>jagat nivasa</i>  O'  refuge  of  the  universe  and
requests Him with the word <i>prasida</i> to be merciful so that he may regain  his
composure.
