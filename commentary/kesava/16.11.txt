The demoniac infatuated by illusion and bewildered  by  ignorance  foolishly
base all their hopes  and  dreams  upon  the  material  existence  which  is
transitory, temporary and impermanent.  Consequently  they  are  deluded  by
their incessant desires, grand ambitions and grandiose schemes of what  they
shall do, what they shall accomplish, what they shall acquire and what  they
shall enjoy all propelled by the desire  of  power  and  wealth  which  they
think will give them longevity. But in reality devoid of the  grace  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna who is the ultimate controller of all; the demoniac  no
matter how powerful they may be or how much they appear  to  be  controlling
are completely enmeshed in the web of illusion like fish trapped  in  a  net
which although appearing to be swimming freely  are  factually  caught  when
the net is tightened. The demoniac incorrigibly addicted to lust, greed  and
insatiable  propensities  for  sense  gratification.  The  demoniac  possess
diabolical dispositions and depraved degraded  habits  and  activities  that
doom them to descend and suffer proportionately for their sinful  activities
in one of the 28 hellish planets which  are  vile  and  detestable  such  as
Rauvara confirmed in the Bhagavat Purana known as Srimad  Bhagavatam:  Canto
5, chapter 26, verse 11: They are forced in their subtle bodies after  death
to be tormented and attacked incessantly by <i>rurus</i> which are  creatures  more
cruel and vicious than a snake. Also confirmed in Srimad  Bhagavatam:  Canto
5, chapter 26, verse 22 is another hellish planet  where  the  demoniac  are
forced to enter in their subtle body is a hellish world known  as  Vaitarani
that is a river full of mucus, puss, faeces, urine  and  phlegm  surrounding
the entire planet and is full of predatory fish of horrible visage who  bite
and attack ferociously.

In all there are 28 principle categories of  hellish  planetary  systems  in
which some lanets are more then 800,000 miles  in  circumference  and  there
are hundreds and thousands of such  planets.  Srimad  Bhagavatam:  Canto  5,
chapter 26, verse 37 confirms: There are hundreds and thousands  of  hellish
planets. These  hellish  planets  are  all  operating  continuously  without
cessation under the administration of  Yamaraj  the  demigod  in  charge  of
death in order to chastise and  punish  the  demoniac  and  impious  without
compunction in accordance to the precise degree of their sinfulness.
