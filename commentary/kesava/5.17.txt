Lord Krishna uses the word <i>panditah</i> meaning wise or learned, for  those  who
perceive the reality as it is and beholds the nature of  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul
equally in all beings. From a Brahmin endowed with spiritual  knowledge  and
a cow the best of all animals both being in the mode of goodness as well  as
a dog and an outcaste person of the lowest  order,  all  are  seen  with  an
equal vision. The purport  is  that  the  apparent  unevenness  between  the
highest and the lowest is the characteristics of  their  bodily  designation
which is the  product  of  material  nature  but  never  reflective  of  the
eternal, pure state of the <i>atma.</i> Such a  wise  being  always  perceives  the
intrinsic nature of the soul as it is, unaffected by the degradation of  any
bodily conception.
