It can be understood how a person being  free  from  desires  is  no  longer
attached to sensual pleasures and focusing within and realising the <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul is able to experience unlimited bliss. But the  question  which
may be raised is how can one become unattached to  the  desire  for  sensual
pleasures from the very beginning? Lord Krishna explains that all  pleasures
in the material world have a beginning and an end. When pleasures are  first
enjoyed they give an acute illusion of  happiness  but  due  to  indomitable
time when such pleasures come to an end as they all must they are the  cause
of acute misery.  For  this  reason  the  spiritually  intelligent  who  are
endowed with the faculty of  discriminative  knowledge  do  not  indulge  in
sense pleasures knowing them to be temporary and binding.
