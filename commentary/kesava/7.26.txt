Lord Krishna emphasises by the words mam tu veda na kascam which means that
no one is able to know Him and because He is the controller of all,
anywhere that He is not veiled is only by His express directive for His
veiling is not for His devotees but for those who are in the clutches of
maya or illusory impressions superimposed upon the mind, so that they will
not be able to know Him.  This He is indicating by the word vedaham meaning
He knows. That He knows by His divine potency and unveiled knowledge.
Although His external energy known as maya veils the mind in varying
degrees of all created beings; it should clearly understood that that all
living beings movable or immovable, belonging to the past, existing in the
present or manifesting in the future are under His complete control and
this is an example of how He is omniscient. It should also be clearly
understood that no one bereft of devotion to the Supreme lord due to being
bewildered and under the control of maya has the qualification to know that
Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord within their heart and within the heart of
every living entity being present everywhere. Hence such ignorant living
entities do not become devoted to Him.
