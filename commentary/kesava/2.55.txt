These characteristics Lord Krishna mentions are all within  the  purview  of
self-experience. How could others recognise such an inner state. To this  he
states undisturbed in sorrow. There are  three  types  of  sorrow  or  pain:
adyatmika or physical,  adhidaivika  or  supernatural  and  adhibhautika  or
natural. Adyatmika is pain of the body and pain of the  mind.  The  pain  of
the body is diseases and ailments attacking it such  as  fever,  rheumatism,
gout, etc. The pain of the mind is due to insult, jealousy,  shame  and  the
like.  Adhidaivika  is  pain  caused   by   drought,   flooding,   cyclones,
earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.  Adhibhautika  is  pain  caused  from  people,
demons, animals, ghosts, etc. All these three are destined by  fate  and  as
such  are  not  transitory  and  after  experiencing  them  they  fade  into
oblivion. Determining in this way that those whose minds remain  unperturbed
in affliction coming due to fate as  well  as  in  happiness  rising  up  by
chance, these beings have become  devoid  of  desires  in  whatever  results
occur.  The reason is they are free from passion, fear  and  anger.  Passion
is the extreme mental attachment to objects cherished  with  intense  desire
with  the  intention  of  never  letting  possession  of  these  objects  be
discontinued. Fear is the pain caused from  the  approaching  agony  arising
from separation from what is cherished. Anger is a specific mental  attitude
which appears in one who experiences separation  at  the  time  of  loss  of
cherished objects. These three passion, fear and anger all arise due to  the
lack of discrimination regarding the eternal nature  of  the  soul.  By  the
gradual development of this  discrimination  one  becomes  free  from  these
three impediments and by this discrimination when  the  introspective  one's
contemplation becomes mature they're known as sthita-prajna.
