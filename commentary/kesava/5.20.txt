If a person is inclined to attachment to sensual pleasures they  will  never
have  the  opportunity  to  experience  the  transcendental  bliss  of   the
realisation of  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence. But a question may be raised what happiness can a  person  derive
from life if they have introverted their senses and  are  averted  to  sense
objects. Lord Krishna  states  the  compound  words  <i>sukham-aksayam</i>  meaning
unlimited happiness is what such persons attains for with  disconnection  to
the senses and objects of the  senses  a  natural  detachment  arises  which
frees one from worldly desires allowing one to focus within on  the  eternal
<i>atma</i> or  eternal  soul  where  one  tastes  boundless  joy  and  experiences
unlimited bliss.  In the moksadharma section of the  Mahabharata  it  states
that: The pleasures of the senses in this world and  the  joys  of  heavenly
pleasures cannot be compared  to  even  1/16th  part  of  the  pleasure  one
derives from renouncing the desire for material  sense  gratification.  This
is the essential component that paves the way for perceiving the <i>Brahman</i>  or
spiritual substratum pervading all existence, <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation  of
the soul and <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the material existence  and  cognition
of the ultimate truth of the Supreme Being.
