The  adjective   <i>vikranta</i>  meaning  valiant  qualifies  Yudhamanyu  and  the
adjective <i>viryavan</i> meaning  very  powerful  qualifies  Uttamauja.  Saubhadra
refers to Abhimanyu the son of Saubhadra by  Arjuna.  Draupadeya  refers  to
the  five  sons  of  Draupadi  being  Prativindhya,  Sutasoma,   Srutakirti,
Sutanika and Srutasena. The particle <i>ca</i> refers  to  Ghatotkaca  the  son  of
Hidimba by Bhima. All these  are also certainly <i>maharathas.</i> Arjuna  and  his
brothers are not mentioned because it is well known by  all  that  they  are
all unrivalled maharathas. The characteristics of a <i>maharatha</i>  are  that  he
can fight single-handedly against 10,000 bow weilding archers and is  expert
in the  science  and  practice  of  warfare.  An  <i>atiratha</i>  can  fight  with
innumerable warriors up to 10,000. A  <i>ratha</i>  can  fight  alone  against  one
opponent and a  ardharatha  cannot defeat even a single opponent.
