The Supreme Lord Krishna being  requested  by  His  surrendered  devotee  to
reveal His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine  universal  form;  responded  with  the  word
<i>pasya</i> meaning behold, His hundred  of  thousands  of  radiant  and  dazzling
transcendental manifestations inferring that he should be  prepared  because
it is difficult to look at. He addresses Arjuna as Partha referring  to  him
as the son of His female devotee Prtha  better  known  as  Kunti.  The  word
<i>rupani</i> meaning forms is used to express  the  manifestation  of  innumerable
multifarious and multicoloured divine forms and shapes.
