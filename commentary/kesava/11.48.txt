Being comforted and consoled by Lord Krishna in such a compassionate manner
and beholding Him now in His charming human form with unprecedented
attributes such as unlimited beauty, strength, compassion, omniscience etc.
Arjuna was no longer agitated and was able to compose himself and restore
his mind to its normal peaceful equilibrium.
