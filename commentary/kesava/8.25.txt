Now Lord Krishna speaks of the path by which there is a  return  of  rebirth
in the world of mortals. This path is the path where the <i>manes</i> or  ancestors
are situated and wherein are stationed the demigods  presiding  over  smoke,
night, the dark fortnight of the moon, the six months  of  the  suns  waning
southern course. The aspirant who is  devoted  to  self  aggrandising  Vedic
activities for attaining the pleasures of the heavenly realms and  also  for
doing public welfare works like excavating drinking water  and  feeding  the
poor to gain  merit are all considered  fruitive  actions  seeking  rewards.
After death such aspirants are led by the aforementioned presiding  demigods
one after another in ascending succession until they  reach  <i>Svargaloka</i>  the
heavenly realms where they enjoy the rewards of  their  material  activities
until the merits of their worldly deeds are finished,  at  which  time  they
return to the world of mortals and are born again. Here the words <i>dhumo  and</i>
<i>ratris</i> meaning smoke and night respectively signify the  presiding  demigods
of <i>Pitriloka</i> the world of the <i>manes.</i> 
<p>
The  Chandogya  Upanisad  V.X.III-VI  states:  Those   who   perform   Vedic
activities like <i>yagna</i> or propitiation and worship for the sake of  acquiring
merit as well those doing philanthropic activities  such  as  donating  food
and land for the sake of acquiring merit, both are guided by  the  presiding
demigods of the smoke, then the night, then  the  dark  moon  fortnight  and
then to the presiding demigod of the sun in its six months  waning  southern
course. These do not reach the presiding demigod of the  year  as  they  are
routed to <i>Pitriloka</i> and from there to space, then  to  the  heavenly  realms
where they enjoy rewards of there good deeds until their merits have  shrunk
to residue and expired. Afterwards these beings  return to be reborn in  the
world of mortals by the same  way  back  which  they  have  come,  from  the
heavenly realms to the space and all the way down to the  smoke  where  they
began. But to be reborn they must transition from the smoke to the mist  and
from the mist to the clouds, from the clouds they transition to  rain  which
falls upon the ground and then transitioning they are born on Earth  in  the
forms of rice, barley and other grains as well as herbs  and  sesame  plants
and various types of beans. Thus it is very difficult to  evolve  from  this
position because only if these different flora are eaten by human or  animal
and subsequently emitted as semen into the womb of a fertile female do  they
become an embryo  and  entering  material  existence  are  able  to  develop
further. The Chandogya  Upanisad  VII.X.VII  states:  Accordingly  those  of
righteous conduct in their previous life will take birth as a human  in  the
family of righteous parents. Whereas those of abominable  conduct  in  their
previous life will take birth in the abominable  wombs  of  dogs,  pigs  and
unclean beings. Therefore those  aspirants  for  moksa  or  liberation  from
material existence should strive to realise the  brahman  or  the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence and achieve the path which leads  to  the
cessation of rebirth no  longer  returning  to  the  material  existence  as
elaborated by Lord Krishna in the previous verse.
