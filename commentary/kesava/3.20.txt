If the counterpoint  is  posed  to  the  previous  verse  that
desireless unattachment should be performed for the purity  of
the mind and that when  spiritual  knowledge  arises  one  may
abandon prescribed Vedic activities; because  otherwise  there
will be no chance for liberation  to  one  always  engaged  in
actions as stated in the Mundakaya Upanisad I.II.XII: One will
be bound by the very actions they perform.
<p>
In anticipation of such a counterpoint Lord  Krishna  confirms
the authority of  previous  examples.  By  referring  to  King
Janaka and by using in the instrumental case the words karmana
eva meaning solely by performing actions as  given  in  Panini
I:II:LXV it clearly indicates that it is through  actions  and
not by abandoning actions that King  Janaka  and  others  like
Asvapati achieved the highest goal of  moksa or liberation. So
one who is knowledgeable of these things  must  perform  their
duties to achieve the goal.
<p>
If another counterpoint is posed  that  a  person  devoted  to
spiritual  knowledge  duly  purifies  their  mind   and   then
attaining atma-tattva or soul realisation is free from rebirth
and is liberated; so what is the necessity to perform  further
prescribed Vedic injunctions. Lord Krishna  anticipating  this
point replies that one should  consider  the  welfare  of  the
people in general and perform prescribed  actions  to  protect
and inspire them as well as for the maintenance of world order
and the preservation of creation. That is why one should still
perform prescribed Vedic activities.
