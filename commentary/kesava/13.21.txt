Thus Lord Krishna has explained that discriminatory knowledge  of  the  <i>atma</i>
or immortal  soul  and  discriminative  knowledge  between  the  <i>purusa</i>  the
supreme being  and  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence insures one surpassing <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle  of  birth  and
death. From this verse until the  end  of  the  chapter  He  deliberates  on
spirit and matter in elaboration of His previous statements. In  this  verse
He clarifies that the combination of spirit and matter is the cause  of  all
living entities taking  birth  throughout  creation  with  the  words  <i>yavat</i>
<i>kincit</i> meaning whatsoever and <i>stavara-jangamam</i> meaning stationary or  mobile
and <i>sanjayate</i> meaning are born. All absolutely arise  from  the  combination
of matter and spirit and not from just matter alone.
