By achieving a state of mental placidity all ones physical as well as  other
sorrows of the aspirant come to an end. The fruition of sorrow and  pain  is
inevitable for one attached to sensual objects. But in the case of  one  who
has purified their mind the sorrows and pains are easily neutralised by  one
of pure mind. Not only are all sorrows and pains neutralised  but  one  also
achieves  great  benefit.  By  the  word  hi  certainly  Lord   Krishna   is
emphasising that such a person of pure and tranquil mind very  soon  becomes
firmly established in transcendent consciousness.
