It could be interjected that just as in a burning  house  the  occupants  of
the house are burned along with it, so also in the case of the soul  if  the
physical body is burnt or cut might not the soul be burnt or  cut  as  well.
To annihilate this misconception  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  expains  that
never can the soul be cut by weapons, never can the soul be burned by  fire,
never can the soul be moistened by water and never can the soul be  withered
by air. Although only one use of the word na meaning never would  have  been
sufficient to establish the premise of utter futility in trying to   destroy
the soul, it is used four times to strengthen the empasis insuring there  is
not even the slightest vestige of doubt.
