It is seen that one feels extreme discomfort due to  bodily  experiences  of
excessive heat and cold and the like; if this is the case then what  is  the
experience for one who remains unconscious of the soul even unto the  moment
of a very painful demise. How can they realize that heat, cold and  pain  to
be impermanent and how can they imagine the eternal  reality  of  the  souls
immortality. Such questions and bewilderment is clarified  by  Lord  Krishna
with the words in the impermanent like heat, cold, pleasure and  pain  there
is no duration and in  the  permanent  as  the  eternal  soul  there  is  no
cessation. It must be understood  that  this  nature  of  the  duration  and
cessation of things in this world  cannot  be  ascertained  by  one  lacking
spiritual intelligence. Lord Krishna emphasizes the point that  the  reality
of the duration and cessation in the material existence has  been  perceived
by those elevated souls who have attained the Ultimate  Truth.  The  eternal
reality of the souls immortality is revealed in various places in the  Vedic
scriptures and this has been  realized  by  those  who  have  achieved  this
understanding.
