The destination referred to in the previous verse applies to  a  person  who
has deviated after a short time from the practice of <i>yoga</i> or the science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness.  Now  Lord  Krishna   reveals   the   destination   of   that
praiseworthy person who has digressed from <i>yoga</i> after  having  practised  it
for a long time. A person who has  dissipated  the  strong  desires  of  the
senses for sensual pleasures by the knowledge of  the  Vedic  scriptures  as
taught by the  spiritual  preceptor  and  is  endowed  with  qualities  like
detachment and renunciation; if by fate such a person is deviated from  <i>yoga</i>
somehow or other such as due to the loss of the spiritual  preceptor  before
one was fully matured, then such  a  person  takes  birth  in  a  family  of
enlightened Brahmins; but not in the family of  wealthy  Brahmins  or  royal
Vedic kings performing opulent ceremonies because  riches and opulence  give
the opportunity to cause distraction to <i>yoga.</i>   Although  being  born  in  a
royal Vedic family or a wealthy family of Brahmins  is  extremely  difficult
to receive due to the requirement of  many  meritorious  deeds;  it  is  not
deemed to be more beneficial than taking birth in a  family  of  spiritually
enlightened Brahmins wedded to <i>yoga</i> because such a birth is  bereft  of  all
possibilities for distraction  and  digression  which  obstruct  and  impede
progress  towards  <i>atma  tattva</i>  realisation  of  the  soul  and  <i>moksa</i>   or
liberation from the material existence.
