The <i>yogi</i> or one perfected in the science  of  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness  who  perceives  the
Supreme Lord in all beings is comparatively  more  advanced  then  the  <i>yogi</i>
described in the previous verse. One who established in <i>yoga</i> perceives  Lord
Krishna presence within all created beings as  <i>paramatma</i>  the  supreme  soul
and ultimate controller of all beings from the highest demigod  down  to  an
inanimate tree and sees all created beings as existing  within  Him  in  His
independent external energy the <i>Brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence which all beings depend on and are  controlled  by  for  their
very existence.  Such a <i>yogi</i> perceiving in this way  is  never  disconnected
from the Supreme Lord nor is the Supreme Lord ever disconnected  from  them.
The purport is that the Supreme Lord bestows His grace  on  such  <i>yogis</i>  and
they are  empowered  by  spiritual  knowledge  to  behold  Him  in  all  His
splendour.
