In this way the complete failure of the ignorant who doubt the  veracity  of
the spiritual well-wishers has been given in order to remove all  doubts  of
the aspirant for <i>moksa</i> or liberation who has faith follows a life  of  pious
conduct. The dual paths of <i>karma yoga</i> or  prescribed  Vedic  activities  and
<i>jnana yoga</i> or cultivation of Vedic knowledge  are  both  concluded  in  this
verse and the next. Actions do not bind one to  material  existence  who  is
renounced. All actions offered or dedicated to the Supreme Lord  are  always
renounced. This is characterised by direct perception  of the  Supreme  Lord
and the conscious reality that one belongs exclusively to Him  which  arises
only after the realisation  of  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  the  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence is perceived.
