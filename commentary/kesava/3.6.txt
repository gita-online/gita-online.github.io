If actions themselves are dependent upon  the  organs  of  the
senses such as  eyes,  nose,  ears  etc.,  then  how  can  one
practice to control them. One who is able  to  restrain  their
body from sense objects still may find their mind attached  to
sense objects. This is due to impurities caused by passion and
desires from  past  lifetimes.  Such  a  person  is  called  a
charlatan. The sense is that the  mind  cannot  be  free  from
attachment  to  sense  objects  because  of  an   absence   of
perfection in karma yoga by performing actions without  desire
thereby destroying the myriads of  sins  collected  from  time
immemorial. Until and unless this has been achieved knowers of
the Vedic scriptures call such a one a hypocrite or  charlatan
and all the efforts of such a charlatan although appearing  as
a renouncer is of no use for moksa or liberation.
