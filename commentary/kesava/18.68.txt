By inquiring whether or not the knowledge  imparted  was  fully  ascertained
and comprehended, Lord Krishna is illustrating the  role  of  the  spiritual
preceptor by exemplifying their duties. A bonafide spiritual  preceptor  can
only be found in one the four authorised  sampradayas:  Brahma,  Sri,  Rudra
and Kummara sampradayas as revealed in Vedic  scriptures.  Such  an  exalted
spriritual master will instruct his disciples until he  is  absolutely  sure
that their ignorance has been entirely dispelled. The inner meaning is  that
in chapter 2, verse 9, due to delusion, Arjuna said that he would not  fight
in the battle. Lord Krishna is subtley implying that if  such  delusion  has
not been eradicated then He is prepared to instruct him again.
