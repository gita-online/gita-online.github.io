Lord Krishna is explicitly confirming that the root cause  and
great impeller of sins is kama or  lust  known  to  forcefully
compel oneâs senses to race impetuously towards objects of the
senses. But kamaâs subordinate krodha or  anger  is  also  the
cause of many evils like violence. When lust  is  impeded  and
desires are frustrated it  is  anger  that  replaces  lust  in
another form. Hence krodha is also a form  of  kama  and  both
arise out of rajas guna or the mode of passion. This  suggests
that by increasing sattva guna or  the  mode  of  goodnes  the
effects of rajas guna can be decreased  and  subsequently  the
power of desires is  less.  Because  controlling  desires  one
controls lust and controlling lust one controls  anger.  There
is no other way. Thus  one  should  not  miss  that  they  are
inteconnected and try to control each seperately. But kama  is
extremely difficult to control  once  it  has  been  activated
because it is insatiable and it does not become tranquil after
even enjoying wealth, pleasure of the flesh, kingdoms and even
the whole world; to the contrary its desires increases exactly
as a fire increases when oil is poured on it, it rages out  of
control and so it is an extremely  evil  propensity  and  when
impeded it explodes into anger destroying all in its path like
a horrific forest fire.
