There is a huge difference between the mentality  of  intelligence  involved
in actions seeking fruitive reward and  the  mentality  of  the  spiritually
evolved engaged in selfless actions not seeking rewards devoted to the  Lord
Krishna which bring  great  happiness.  Thus  Lord  Krishna  says  the  word
vyavasa or resolute. The purpose for actions must be  resolute.  One  should
perform actions with the thought that it is for  the  ultimate  satisfaction
for Lord Krishna thinking that their action will  please  Him  and  for  not
other reason. This resolute intelligence  gives  one  the  realization  that
they will easily be liberated by the Lords grace, from samsara the ocean  of
birth and death in the material existence and only by His grace. It is  one-
pointed because its aim is solely  for  the  service  and  devotion  of  the
omnipotent, omniscient, Supreme Lord Krishna the  controller  and  dispenser
of all rewards and the sole destination of  all  those  seeking  liberation.
This resolute intelligence bestows one result and that  is  it  gives  great
happiness and thus it is considered as already possessed by  those  who  are
in the process of devotion to Lord  Krishna  already.  Those  of  fragmented
intelligence who have not perceived reality and whose  endless  desires  for
fame, wealth,  power,  etc.  and  who  by  their  actions  are  dictated  by
procuring and accumalization and work  and  reward.  Their  intelligence  is
fragmented into endless directions each unique unto itself  and  of  diverse
types all leading to misery. These things can only be  perceived  by  direct
experience.
