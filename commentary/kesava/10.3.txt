Lord Krishna confirms the fact that real knowledge about His  transcendental
<i>rupa</i> or form is difficult to be understood by even the  demigods  and  great
sages. Ignorance about Lord Krishna and His Supreme position  as  the  prime
cause and origin of all gods and great sages is the obstinate obstacle  that
limits and impedes the <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  from  developing  <i>bhakti</i>
which is exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.  Whoever  knows  Him
in reality as the unborn without  beginning  as  the  Supreme  Lord  of  all
creation and the Supreme  Controller  of  all  existence.  The  Svetasvatara
Upanisad III.IV states: He alone  is  the  source  and  origin  of  all  the
demigods. Those lacking in knowledge  may  surmise  that  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna rulership is just localised of  the  complete  cosmic  manifestation
and may hypothecate that His power is the same as any other  god;  but  such
offensive  thinking  is  not  productive  and  a  foolish  misnomer,  so  to
neutralise any such concoctions Lord Krishna uses the words  <i>loka-mahesvaram</i>
or the Supreme controller of the complete  cosmic  manifestation  throughout
the entire realm of all creation. The Svetasvatara Upanisad  VI.VII  states:
He who is the Supreme God  of  all  gods,  the  Paramount  Divinity  of  all
divinities, the Ultimate Ruler of all rulers is to be known as the  adorable
Lord. Those who know Lord Krishna as the Supreme Lord of all lords  are  not
deluded and do not possess the great delusion of considering any  other  god
as being equal to or the same as Him. Such blessed beings become  free  from
all reactions to all their past and present actions  and  have  crossed  all
obstacles enabling them to develop <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion to Him.

The conclusion is that by all means one should avoid such  delusion  because
those who erroneously considers that any other god from any other belief  is
equal to or the same as the Supreme Lord Krishna or any  of  His  authorised
incarnations and  expansions  as  revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures,  are  all
greatly ignorant and sinful beings in whom loving devotion for  the  Supreme
Lord will never  germinate.  The  Pancaratra  texts  confirm:  That  one  of
deluded mind who foolishly speaks of the Supreme Lord Krishna  as  equal  to
any other god even once is an evil person from a sub-human class.  There  is
no being more low than this being.
