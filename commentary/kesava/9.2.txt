Moreover this divine  spiritual  knowledge  is  <i>raja-vidya</i>  or  a  sovereign
science because it destroys all vestiges of nescience and it is  <i>raja-guhyam</i>
or a sovereign  secret  because  it  is  unattainable  to  those  who  never
practiced <i>bhakti</i> or pure loving devotion to  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His
Vedically authorised <i>avatar`s</i> or  incarnations  and  expansions  even  after
thousands of lifetimes. Because without <i>bhakti</i> one  can  never  receive  His
grace and without His mercy no one can ever  escape  <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual
cycle of birth death<i>.</i> Some scholars and logicians may argue that  the  words
<i>raja-vidya</i>  and  <i>raja-guhyam</i>  are  grammatically  wrong  by  Panini's   rule
II.II.XXX that instructs that in a compound word the primary word  which  in
this case is <i>raja</i> takes the secondary position. But the  fact  is  according
to the even more dominant rule of Panini's II.II.XXXI which states that  any
form of the word <i>rajan</i> which means sovereign ruler  or  king  should  always
occupy the first position and so  consequently  neutralises  this  argument.
This divine spiritual knowledge is  supremely  sacred  like  expiatory  vows
which destroys manifold sins. The vestiges of sins destroyed from  expiatory
vows remain in their subtle forms and by their influence may induce  one  to
commit gross sins again. But to the  contrary  this  most  sacred  spiritual
knowledge completely exterminates all sins in their gross and  subtle  forms
which have been accumulating for thousands and thousands  of  lifetimes.  So
this divine spiritual knowledge is <i>pavitram  idam  uttamam</i>  the  topmost  in
purity and <i>pratyaksavagamam</i> directly  realised.  The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
becomes  the  direct  realisation  of  His  devotees  aspirations.  This  is
attained  by  this  divine  spiritual  knowledge  imparted  by  a   bonafide
spiritual master in authorised discipic succession as revealed in the  Vedic
scriptures, who also instructs and imparts <i>bhakti</i> or pure,  loving  devotion
for Lord Krishna which must be accompanying  any  effort  as  well.  Such  a
one's  actions  are  never  devoid  of  <i>punya</i>  or  piety   and   <i>dharma</i>   or
righteousness which are essential.
<p>
This divine and  sacred  spiritual  knowledge  is  naturally  virtuous  also
because it was able to be achieved as a result of selfless  actions  without
attachment or desirous of rewards performed for thousands and  thousands  of
lifetimes and  because  it  is  the  indispensable  means  of  reaching  and
attaining the Supreme Lord it is the paramount of all knowledge. Because  of
the nature of <i>bhakti,</i> the love one feels in  their  heart  for  the  Supreme
Lord makes it <i>su-sukham kartum</i> or very joyful and easy  to  perform  without
any  difficulty.  It  is  practiced  by  righteous  determination  and   the
conscious cultivation of the teachings of the Vedically  bonafide  spiritual
master while simultaneously dedicating all activities to the  Supreme  Lord.
It is also <i>avvayam</i> imperishable  because  it  causes  no  demerits  by  non-
committance caused by defective practice  so  its  meritorious  results  are
permanent and are not subject to being dissolved even  after  bestowing  the
ultimate reward of attaining the Supreme Lord.
