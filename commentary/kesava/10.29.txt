Among purifiers Lord Krishna's <i>vibhuti</i> or  divine,  transcendental  opulence
is the swift moving wind. Among weapon wielding warriors His <i>vibhuti</i> is  the
valiant hero Rama who is a <i>lila</i> <i>avatar</i> or divine pastime incarnation of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna being His catur-vyuya expansion  Vasudeva.  One  should
never think that Rama born of King  Dasaratha  in  the  solar  line  of  the
exalted Raghu dynasty is non-different from the Supreme Lord Krishna  except
in <i>rasa</i> or mood. The word Rama may also be interpreted to be Parasurama  the
son of Jamadagni and  Renuka,  who  was  a  <i>sakyavesa  avatar</i>  or  empowered
incarnation of Lord Krishna who slew all the <i>ksatriyas</i>  21  times  with  His
mighty axe. Among rivers His <i>vibhuti</i> is <i>jahnavi</i> the  daughter  of  the  sage
Jahnu known as the holy river Ganges.
