Sanjaya is now speaking to King Dhrtarastra summarised in  six  verses  that
the Supreme Lord Krishna being earnestly requested with devotion  to  reveal
His phenomenal, awe inspiring  <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine  universal  form,  gave
Arjuna the prerequisite divine vision to  see  it  and  then  exhibited  His
almighty transcendental form in its entirety.  This is  what  is  understood
by the word <i>evam</i> meaning in this way. Then the omnipotent Lord  Krishna  who
is  being  referred  to  by  the  name  <i>Hari</i>  or  He  who  takes  away   all
inauspiciousness from His devotees displayed His supreme,  divine  universal
form to His devotee Arjuna, the son of His father Vasudeva's sister  who  is
known as Pritha or Kunti.
