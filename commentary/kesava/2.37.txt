So in order to protect both the Earth and the heavenly realms it  is  better
for a mighty warrior to face  his  enemies  and  fight.  This  Lord  Krishna
emphasises with the word hata meaning slain showing that slain or not  slain
there is benefit in both. So by this Arjunas previous doubt of  not  knowing
what is better to slay or be slain and will they have  victory  or  not  are
eradicated as both conclusions give benefit. So Arjuna should  rise  up  and
fight.
