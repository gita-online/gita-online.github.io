Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine  universal  form  was  so  colossal  it
extended beyond the sky into all the spaces between the  galaxies  and  even
unto the universes. Having unlimited feet, legs, arms, heads,  faces  mouths
and teeth it was terrible to behold and caused the beings of all the  worlds
great trepidation and fear and Arjuna was feeling this as well.
