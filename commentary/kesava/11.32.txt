Arjuna may have doubt reflecting that Drona received the divine  science  of
weapons by mantra from <i>avatara</i> or incarnation Parasurama  Himself.  Also  he
is hesitant to slay Drona who had taught him so well the science of  archery
making him the greatest archer in the world. Bhisma has  received  the  boon
that he can die at the time of his choosing and educated by  Brihaspati  the
guru of the demigods, he was invincible. Jayadratha has the  boon  from  his
father that whoever takes his head off at the  neck  with  any  weapon  will
have their own head burst into pieces.  Karna  the  son  of  the  Surya  the
sungod has received a boon from Indra in the form  of  a  weapon  that  will
slay whoever he launches it at.  Also  there  are  other  warriors  such  as
Kripacarya  and  Asvatthama  who  are  undefeatable  in  battle.  Arjuna  is
certainly not doubting the words of Lord Krishna but with  such  a  powerful
array of mighty warriors against him, he was wondering how he will  be  able
to defeat them all.
