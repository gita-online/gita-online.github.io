One situated in transcendent meditation has no connections to  their  senses
whatsoever; but such a being cannot be perceived. As the  functions  of  the
senses such as seeing, hearing, and tasting of an ordinary  person  are  the
exact same to one situated in transcendent meditation,
How is it possible  to  properly  understand  what  this  means?  Here  Lord
Krishna indicates that the operation  of  the  senses  to  one  situated  in
transcendent mediation are completely  different  from  an  ordinary  being.
This is because those whose minds are inclined  towards  sense  objects  are
unqualified to realise the soul  their  intellect  being  likened  unto  the
darkness of night. Whereas the self restrained living  entities  with  their
sense organs fully controlled remains awake and realises the essence of  the
eternal soul and  God  realisation  by  the  eternal  truths  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. The tendency of all living entities whose external senses  along
with the mind are not under control in the darkness of nescience indulge  in
sensual delights in this night. Contrarily the self controlled one sees  the
objects of the senses as unfit and reflects  on  the  eternal  soul  within.
Thus these are the indications of one situated in transcendent meditation.
