Concerning the assurance of whether or not he is capable  of  beholding  the
<i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form, Lord Krishna informs Arjuna that  he  is
not able to see His almighty <i>visvarupa</i> with his present eyes which are  only
habituated to seeing material objects  within  limited  dimensions.  So  the
Supreme Lord by His power of unparalleled  transcendence  bestows  upon  him
celestial vision to see the divine universal form. This power is  completely
able to make the impossible fully possible.
