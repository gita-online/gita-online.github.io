Lord Krishna presents this knowledge so  as  to  provoke  attention  to  the
recipient by  the  words  <i>idam  jnanam</i>  meaning  the  theoretical  knowledge
described  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  and  the  words  <i>sa-vijnanam</i>  meaning
knowledge of  His  manifested  divine  majesty  based  on  realisation.  The
combination of theoretical knowledge with realisation from  one's  very  own
actual experience insures that there will be nothing else to  be  known  for
an aspirant in  this  world  for  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  the  material
existence  who  is  engaged  in  practising  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness.
