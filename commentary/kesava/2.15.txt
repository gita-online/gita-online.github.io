If one were to question  what  would  be  the  result  if  one  ignores  the
connection between the senses and the sense  objects  Lord  Krishna  answers
this by explaining that one who is performing their  natural  duty  in  life
which  is  prescribed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  according  to  their  own
individual qualifications, without  desiring  any  gratification  for  their
actions; what then can deter this living entity and cause  them  to  deviate
irresponsibly.  The  spiritually  intelligent,  living  entity,   possessing
patience, whom remains equal in happiness and unhappiness  becomes  eligible
for immortality, by which lifes highest goal is acquired of ones  individual
spiritual nature devoid of the imperfections  connected  with  the  physical
body such as of old age, disease and death.
