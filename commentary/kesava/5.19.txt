Thus it is established that  the  cause  of  triumph  over  <i>samsara</i>  or  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death is absolute equanimity of  perception  by
beholding the reality that the eternal  soul  is  equally  situated  in  all
naturally created beings. One who is also equiposed regarding the  dualities
and not elated by obtaining something pleasant thinking how lucky am  I  nor
dejected by receiving something unpleasant thinking how  unfortunate  am  I.
Such  a  person  endowed  with  firm  resolution  reflects  that:   I   will
steadfastly cross over the ocean of <i>samsara</i> through the  knowledge  of  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the soul. Such a person is  free  from  all  doubts
and infatuation with delusion which is merely a tendency of the  mind.  Such
a person becomes a knower of the <i>Brahman</i> or spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence after being instructed by a  living  knower  of  the  <i>Brahman.</i>
Such a person lives their life immersed in the <i>atma</i> or soul which is of  the
same absolute nature of the <i>Brahman.</i>
