Now the three modes that were dealt with in the Vedas  has  been  set  aside
for there is not a single thing within the material existence that is  apart
from the three modes. So in lieu of this one may question  that  in  seeking
liberation from material existence one would  have  to  abandon  everything,
even that which is required for the performance of worship  and  thus  there
would be no motivation. To this Lord Krishna instructs this verse that  just
as different wells for drinking, bathing, washing animals etc. can  be  used
all their uses can be satisfied by a large reservoir of water.  Thinking  in
this way one desiring liberation who is enlightened by the  reality  of  the
Vedas realises and follows the conclusion of the Vedas.  One  should  follow
that portion of the Vedas to perform activities that are  most  pleasing  to
Lord Krishna which is in the best interests of all beings. It  is  not  that
one must just adopt everything that is said in the Vedas. One  should  never
do activities against the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures but  according
to qualification and circumstances one must follow  what  is  prescribed  in
the Vedas. For example certain rituals such as the agnihotra are  prescribed
to  be  performed  in  the  Vedas;  but  they  are  prescribed  for  married
householders. They are not to be performed by sannyasis.  Also  celibacy  is
prescribed in the Vedic scriptures but it is prescribed for brahmacaris  and
sannyasis. It is not prescribed for married  householders.   So  it  is  not
that everything in the Vedas is to be followed by everyone although all  the
four orders must certainly follow the Vedas but according  to  ones  ashram.
This is the discrimination regarding this matter.
