Why are they trying to kill the Pandavas in the first  place  might  now  be
asked? In this verse Arjuna is stating that the Kauravas their  hearts  full
of greed, devoid of piety see no fault and perceive no  sinful  reaction  in
the slaying of family members and  hence  they  act  in  ignorance.  Now  in
support of his reason for not fighting Arjuna states that the  Pandavas  are
not like the Kauravas because  of  knowing  fully  the  sinful  reaction  of
slaying kinsman. So why should they engage in this abominable act.  Being  a
devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna who  is  the  propounder  of  <i>dharma</i>  or
righteousness, Arjuna addresses him by the  vocative  <i>Janardana</i>  meaning  as
the  remover  of  his  devotees  ignorance;  why  should  they  not  refrain
themselves from such  ignorance  being  cognizant  of  the  implications  of
unrighteousness?
