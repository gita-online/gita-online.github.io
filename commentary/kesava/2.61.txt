Lord Krishna states that one who contemplates sensual objects like form  and
touch develops in the mind attachment for them in the form of  lust  deluded
into believing such objects to be the  root  cause  of  apparent  happiness.
From  this  attachment  springs  desire  which  is  but  a  modification  of
attachment. Sometimes one is able to gratify ones senses by  enjoying  these
sense objects. At that time a particular state  of  mind  arises  where  one
becomes enslaved and controlled by the desire of the very  same  object  one
is seeking so desperately to exploit. Other times ones desires are  thwarted
and obstructed and unfulfilled  in  satisfying  ones  desire  to  experience
sense objects leads to frustration which  is  also  a  modification  of  the
mind. At this time anger is directed in fury towards whatever  it  was  that
became the obstacle that blocked ones gratification.
