An objection might be made that although  it  is  definitely  beneficial  to
avoid evil activities;  but  why  should  one  abandon  good  actions.  Lord
Krishna responds that the wise who consider the true nature  of  things  and
have contemplated the cause of birth and  death  realised  that  while  evil
deeds give rise to horrible reactions also reactions to good deeds   propels
one to be born in noble and wealthy families while still  remaining  in  the
material existence are still subject to pleasure and  pain  and  subject  to
old age, disease and death and thus should also be avoided. Liberation  from
the material existence is the direction to  strive  for  and  attaining  the
blissful state of  the  spiritual  worlds  described  in  the  Upanisads  as
Vaikuntha which free from all misery and is eternally  beyond  the  illusion
of maya which is  a product of the material nature. The conclusion  is  that
in order to attain the unlimited bliss of boundless  joy  in  the  spiritual
worlds one must abandon meritorious deeds also  or  else  they  will  bestow
trivial material rewards.
