Behaving in this manner of offering everything in devotion  to  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna including the doership of all actions  with  one's  mind  fully
established in the renunciation of  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness, one will be freed  from
the bonds of <i>karma</i> or reactions from actions both good  and  evil  that  the
whole material creation is subjected to. This  is  because  by  surrendering
and dedicating all actions to the Supreme Lord all <i>karma</i> is  neutralised  as
has no longer any power to cause any effects whatsoever  and  thus  released
from the clutches of reactions one will achieve exemption from  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle o birth  and  death  and  attain  the   association  of  the
Supreme Lord in the eternal spiritual worlds.
