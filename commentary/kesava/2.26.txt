In this way after establishing the eternal reality of the souls  immortality
according to the authority of  Vedic scripture,  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
describes that it is not  intelligent  to  lament  about  it,  even  if  one
accepts the hypothesis of the Digambaras who believe that the  soul  is  the
same size as the body and is born  and  experiences  death  along  with  the
body. This  is  referred  to  by  the  particle  atha  meaning  if  however,
indicating according to another view. Accepting even this  other  view  that
the soul is constantly being born and constantly dying  there  is  still  no
reason to lament about it and the reason why Lord  Krishna  reveals  in  the
next verse.
