In this way although Arjuna had decided to refrain  from  the  battle  still
Dhritarastra should not expect that the future of his sons was to be  bright
and happy as long as  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  the  controller  of  the
animate and inanimate who descended personally to destroy the miscreants  is
present in this world. To emphasize this  reality  Sanjaya  said  to  him  O
Bharata referring to his anscestor, the great monarch of all the world  King
Bharata telling frankly that  the  joy  he  is  feeling  regarding  Arjuna's
seemingly abstention from the battle and the termination of the war was  not
appropriate. Lord Krishna with a subtle smile upon his face  then  spoke  to
Arjuna who was  lamenting  at  a  most  inappropriate  time  between  the  2
opposing armies. The word prahasan  meaning  smiling  is  used  to  subtlely
indicate sarcasam  and  evoke  anger  at  the  impropriety  of  such  limpid
sensitivity by Arjuna who in his own right is  a  mighty  warrior  respected
and reknowed  by  all  the  mightiest  warriors  of  his  time.  This  smile
indicating sarcasm is justified by the use  of  the  word  iva  as  it  were
indicating that due to the nature of  the  situation,  being  the  2  armies
immeadiately  ready  for  battle,  Arjunas  reluctancy  and   Lord   Krishna
accepting him as a disciple. So in order to  substantiate  Arjunas   fitness
to receive spiritual knowledge this subtle  smile  is  used  to  remove  any
lingering vestiges of pride Arjuna might have had regarding  his  knowledge,
intelligence and prowess.
