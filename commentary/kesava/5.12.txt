Persons full of selfish desires hankering for the rewards of  their  actions
are tightly bound to the material existence by the actions of  their  bodies
and senses impelled by the very desires they  seek  to  gratify.  While  the
aspirant for <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul although  also  involved
in activities of the physical body realise they  are  undoubtedly  different
from the actions of the body and the senses. Such  a  person  of  controlled
mind and sense organs is well aware that the ego and ideas of I-ness and my-
ness revolve around the bodily conception so  they  never  ignorantly  think
that the physical body is who they really are and hence understand that  any
doership is not of the nature  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul.  So  abandoning  all
fruitive and frivolous actions and residing contentedly in the city of  nine
gates known as the physical body which also has no ego  sense  possessed  of
two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, one generating  organ  and  one
organ for excretion totalling  nine  an  embodied  being  is  not  bound  to
material existence by actions.
