Now Lord Krishna explains  the  relationship  and  interaction  between  the
three <i>gunas</i> which are <i>sattva guna</i> or the mode of goodness, <i>raja guna</i> or  the
mode of passion and <i>tama guna</i> or the mode  of  ignorance.  All  three  <i>gunas</i>
inexplicably locked to all <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  throughout  material
existence; but one of the <i>gunas</i> prevails over  the  other  two  due  to  the
stringent law of <i>karma</i> or the reactions of committed  actions  performed  in
the previous lifetime combined with the  effects  from  the  types  of  food
eaten  such  as  vegetarian  or  animal,  compounded  with  the  degree   of
sinfulness committed knowingly or unknowingly determines which of the  three
<i>gunas</i> will be prevalent. The Chadogya Upanisad VI.VI.V  beginning  <i>annamayam</i>
<i>hi somya mana</i> states: The mind is made up of the food that  it  eats.  Srila
Vedavyasa states in the  Bhagavat Purana  that  knowledge,  water,  progeny,
place, time, actions, origin, meditation, formula and mental  tendency,  are
the 10 causes  of growth
