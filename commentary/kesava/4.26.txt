Lord Krishna speaks of superior to those by the word <i>apare</i>  meaning  others.
These <i>yogis</i> indulge in  the  spiritual  practice  of  renunciation  and  are
desirous of attaining knowledge  of  the  <i>Brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence. They keep all their senses away from sense  objects
and offer the senses into the  fire  of  self-discipline.  Others  like  the
<i>grihastas</i> or those family orientated indulging in worldly  achievements  and
desirous of dynasty and progeny offer sense objects into  the  fire  of  the
senses during enjoyment of  them  of  the  sense  objects.  The  senses  are
considered by them to be the fire and such  persons  indulge  themselves  in
sense gratification as a symbol of performing <i>yagna</i> or worship.
