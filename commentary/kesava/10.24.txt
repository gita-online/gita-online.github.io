Among trees Lord Krishna's <i>vibhuti</i> or  divine,  transcendental  opulence  is
the <i>Asvattha</i> or the sacred Banyan tree also called the  holy  fig  tree  and
known as Ficus Bengalensis. Among celestial sages His <i>vibhuti</i> is  Narada  of
exceptional <i>bhakti</i>  or  loving  devotion.  Of  the  <i>Gandarvas</i>  or  celestial
singers and musicians His vibhuti is Citraratha of outstanding  singing.  Of
perfected  beings  who  have  since  inception  acquired  spiritual  wisdom,
dispassion, renunciation etc. and are endowed with  great  purity,  holiness
and  enlightenment  possessing  all  <i>siddhis</i>  or  supernatural  powers,  His
<i>vibhuti</i> is Kapiladeva the son of Kardama Muni and Devahuti.
