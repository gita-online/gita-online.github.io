Lord Krishna is explaining that concerning the <i>gunas</i> or the three  modes  of
material nature the variations  in  the  results  is  attributed  originally
within the respective charcterisitics of  each  quality.  The  results  from
<i>sattva guna</i> or mode of goodness is knowledge which  has  understanding  that
is illuminated and from that gives great happiness. The  results  from  <i>raja</i>
<i>guna</i> or mode of passion is unabated desires which  incites  incessant  greed
for wealth and constant hankering for  sense  gratificationfrom  form  which
comes pain by the endeavor and suffering from the  loss.  The  results  from
<i>tama guna</i> or the mode of ignorance is  nescience  and  inertia  which  gives
delusion and forces one to be in the darkness of illusion.
