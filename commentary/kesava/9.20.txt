Previously  Lord  Krishna  has  illustrated  the  respective   repercussions
concerning the nature of the non-believers and the demoniac who are  opposed
to divinity and everything godly. Later it could  be  understood  from  that
description that the Supreme Lord's grace only flows to  the  <i>mahatmanas</i>  or
great  beings  who  have  dedicated  themselves  to  incessantly   acquiring
knowledge about Him and are only interested in performing <i>bhakti</i>  or  loving
devotion to Him. Now in this verse and the next He presents the rewards  for
those who are not devotees but are not opposed to divinity  and  who  follow
<i>karma-kanda</i> or performing  meritorious  actions  for  the  sake  of  reaping
heavenly rewards. Such votaries hankering for entry  to  <i>Swargaloka</i>  or  the
celestial realms  to  enjoy  exquisite  heavenly  delights  worshipping  the
demigods as prescribed in the three Vedas. This is what is  known  as  <i>trai-</i>
<i>vidya</i> and applies to anyone who has self orientated motives  for  performing
the injunctions of the Rig Veda, Sama  Veda,  Yajur  Veda  as  well  as  the
Atharva Veda. Such a person is  devoted  to  performing  Vedic  rituals  for
personal gain and not as a spiritual practice as enjoined in  the  Upanisads
and other Vedic scriptures. So they perform worship and adoration  to  <i>Indra</i>
the chief of the demigods and other celestials even lesser than him by  such
rituals never realising that it  is  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  who  alone
sanctions whatever has  been  bequeathed.  Still  in  consequence  of  being
dedicated to performing Vedic rituals they become purged of all  sins  which
are no longer an obstruction for entry into <i>Swargaloka</i>  where  they  receive
the full measure of their merits and are rewarded  with  heavenly  pleasures
and enjoyments until their accumulated merit has expired.
