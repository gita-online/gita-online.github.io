So Duryodhana full of internal anxiety deceptively addressed  the  preceptor
Dronacarya attempting to conceal his fear at the might of the Pandava  army.
Drona understanding the offensive innuendo by the words  inner  significance
ignored Duryodhana  being  dissatisfied  by  the  subtle  sarcasm  concealed
within the words. At this time  the  valiant  grandsire  Bhishma  perceiving
Duryodhana's inner despondency, roared like a lion  and  blew  a  thunderous
blast on his conch shell just to
increase Duryodhana's joy.
