One who craves for nothing and remains unattached  to  the  worldly  objects
which come unsolicited of their own  accord,  who  is  cleansed  within  and
without, who is expert in applying the teachings  of  the  Vedic  scriptures
and performing the obligatory rites, who is indifferent to  mundane  matters
and unconcerned about insult or praise while renouncing all  conceptions  of
doership in all undertakings except those that increase <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive
loving devotion to the Supreme Lord is very dear to Lord Krishna.
