That <i>yagna</i> or propitiation and worship which  externally  may  be  performed
according to the Vedic scriptures but internally is plagued with desires  to
acquire the fruits of its rewards  and  is  ostentatiously  enacted  out  of
pride and gregariously carried out for prestige is  irascibly  performed  in
the mode of passion.
