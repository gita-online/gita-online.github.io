Lord Krishna has discussed this sacred spiritual knowledge  which  leads  to
Him by praising the merits of following  it  and  stating  the  consequences
incurred by not following it. Now He calls the attention of the listener  by
revealing that He pervades the <i>sarvam  jagad</i>  or  complete  material  cosmic
manifestation. How does He  accomplish  this?  By  dint  of  His  unmanifest
potency in the form of the <i>brahman</i> the spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence which is beyond the perception of  the  five  senses.  All  beings
movable and immovable reside within Lord Krishna who is the  source  of  all
creation. The Vedic scriptures declare that He is the <i>atma</i>  or  soul  within
which permeates all sentient beings and  impels  them  to  perform  actions.
Also Sahadeva's statement in the Sabhaparva  of  the  Mahabharata  that  the
mind, intellect, cosmic intelligence, wind, fire, water,  earth,  ether  and
the four fold beings reside within the Supreme Lord Krishna. But where  does
He reside? He reveals  that  He  is  in  each  and  very  living  entity  as
<i>paramatma</i> the supersoul and that He is the substratum  of  all  beings;  but
none are His substratum for He is His own substratum  and  does  not  depend
upon anything for residing and functioning. This is also  confirmed  in  the
Bhuma Vidya section of the Chandogya Upanisad  VII.XXIV.I  where  it  states
that: On Earth people call the possession of cows, horses, elephants,  gold,
property, palaces etc. as greatness but the  Supreme  Lord  does  not  think
thus because clearly each thing is established upon  another.  In  VII.XXV.I
of the Chandogya Upanisad it states:That omnipresence  is  above  and  below
and to the east and the west and the north and the south. Indeed it  is  the
total material creation.
