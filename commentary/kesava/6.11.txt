The appropriate place to sit is given here by Lord  Krishna  beginning  with
the word  <i>sucau  dese  pratisthapya</i>  meaning  established  in  a  clean  and
sanctified place and ending with <i>yogam atma-visuddhaye</i>  meaning  one  should
purify their mind in meditation by practicing <i>yoga</i> or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness.
