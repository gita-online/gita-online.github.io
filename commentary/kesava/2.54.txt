In order to answer Arjunas four  questions  Lord  Krishna  begins  here  and
continues till the end of the chapter.  To  answer  the  first  question  He
explains that when one thoroughly abandons all cravings of the mind  one  is
sthita-prajna  situated  in  transcendent   consciousness.   What   is   the
indication that one has abandoned all cravings of  the  mind?  Lord  Krishna
explains that such a being  is  immersed  in  the  soul  and  is  completely
satisfied by the soul. The stability of ones mind  can  be  known  when  one
becomes pleased and satisfied by the resultant  purity  of  the  mind  after
completely abandoning all desires and lust. In the soul,  self-contained  by
its own inherent nature in the form of knowledge, eternality  and  bliss  is
characterised  by  the  total  annihilation  of  all  sins  as  declared  by
Prajapati   in  the  spiritual  discourse  he  delivered  as  seen  in   the
Upanisads.
