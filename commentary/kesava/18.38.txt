Thus concluding His exposition on the  threefold  influences  of  the  three
<i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  reveals  that
there is no <i>jiva</i> or embodied being  in  a  subtle  body,  physical  body  or
etheric body in any species including human, demigod  and  demoniac  in  the
material  worlds,  heavenly  spheres  or  demoniac  planets  everywhere   in
creation that are exempt from the influence of the three <i>gunas</i> arising  from
<i>prakriti</i> the material substratum pervading physical  existence  which  is  a
manifested potency of the Supreme Lord.
