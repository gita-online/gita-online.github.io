Lord Krishna uses the words <i>sanaih sanair</i> meaning gradually by  degrees  one
who has completely withdrawn their senses  from  all  external  distractions
fixes the unflickering mind on the <i>atma</i>  or  soul  with  firm  and  resolute
determination that they will in due course of  time  most  assuredly  become
established  in  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the  individual   consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness.  By  thinking  in  this
way there will be no slackness in  their  practice  or  diversion  in  their
enthusiasm although on occasion there might arise  delays  and  obstructions
on their way still they should think only on the <i>atma.</i>
