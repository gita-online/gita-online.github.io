Thus Lord Krishna has described the  threefold  characteristics  of  action,
its knowledge and the performer of actions based upon the  the  three  <i>gunas</i>
or modes of material nature. Next He will speak of <i>buddhi</i> or  intellect  and
<i>dhriti</i>  or  determination  also  based  on  the  influence  of   the   three
<i>gunas.</i> Both are essential in the ascertainment  of  truth  and  reality  and
worldly parlance and require clarity and reason in the  case  of  <i>buddhi</i>  as
well as patience and forebearance applying to <i>dhriti.</i>
