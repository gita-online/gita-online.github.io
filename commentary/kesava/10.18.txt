Before Lord Krishna commences speaking  of  His  transcendental  glories  He
describes His glorious divine spiritual  form.  The  words  <i>sarva-bhutasaya-</i>
<i>sthitah</i> means  abiding  in  the  heart  of  all  sentient  beings.  How?  As
<i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul residing  within  the  <i>atma</i>  or  individual  soul
which all collectively comprise  His  transcendental,  spiritual  body.  The
Supreme Lord Krishna is the beginning meaning creation, the  middle  meaning
sustenance and the end meaning destruction  of  all  living  entities  along
with all insentient elements. The Supreme Lord  uses  the  address  <i>Gudakesa</i>
meaning one who has control over sleep which indicates that Arjuna  has  the
ability to be ever wakeful and aware.
