Lord Krishna refers again to the Supreme Lord whom is the ultimate  goal  to
attain and the most worthy and whose divine opulence  is  expressed  as  the
sun and the moon. He explains that the Supreme Lord  is  transcendental  and
different from both <i>ksarah</i> or perishable and <i>aksarah</i>  or  imperishable.  The
Supreme Lord is indestructible, eternal and infallible. He  is  the  highest
reality,  the  ultimate  controller  of  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum
pervading  physical  existence  as  well  as  the  <i>brahman</i>    or   spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. Having integrated Himself  as  <i>paramatma</i>
the Supreme soul within  the  etheric  heart  of  each  and  every  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being; the Supreme Lord maintains and sustains them along with  all
of creation.
