Lord Krishna is stating that  the  position  and  status  of  all  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings and their category can be determined by understanding  their
<i>sraddha</i>  or  faith.  The  three  kinds  of  <i>sraddha</i>  can  be  observed   and
specifically categorised from indicatory signs in the form of their mode  of
worship, whom they worship, whether or  not  the  worship  is   abstract  or
finites, etc. Those endowed with a preponderance of <i>sattva guna</i> or  mode  of
goodness worship  the  Supreme  Lord  and  their  faith  is  saturated  with
goodness. Those possessed with a preponderance  of  <i>raja  guna</i>  or  mode  of
passion pay homage to demoniac entities for power  and  dominion  and  their
faith is saturated with passion. Those possessed  with  a  preponderance  of
<i>tama guna</i> or the mode of ignorance pray to  ghosts  and  spirits  and  their
faith is saturated with ignorance.
