In this verse Lord Krishna gives additional reasons  why  one  should  never
grieve for the soul. Because the soul is unmanifest it is  not  able  to  be
cut or burned like objects which  are  manifest  in  this  world  and  being
unmanifest it is inconceivable as it is not possible to equate it  with  the
form  or  nature  of  anything  that  one  could  imagine  in  the  material
existence. Being unable to imagine the constitution of  the  soul  indicates
it is immutable because it is devoid of  any  process  of  modification  for
example  milk  transforming to youghurt. Therfore comprehending  the  nature
and quality of the soul as enunciated above one  should  not  be  under  the
delusion of lamentation.
