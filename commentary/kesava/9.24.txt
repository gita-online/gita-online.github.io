Now Lord Krishna  explains  the  maximum  rewards  the  worshippers  of  the
demigods get and why it is <i>avidi-puvakam</i>  or  not  in  accordance  with  the
ordinances of the Vedic scriptures. As the Supreme Lord is <i>paramatma</i> or  the
Supreme Soul within all the demigods and all living entities as well  it  is
He who is the direct recipient of all the offerings and worship to them.  He
alone solely bestows the rewards  of  propitiation  and  worship  back  down
through the demigods to which it was offered who after  taking  their  share
offer it to their votaries. Those who are motivated by selfish  desires  are
devoid of <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotional service and  have  no  possibility  of
knowing the Supreme Lord. For their efforts the worshippers of the  demigods
eventually ascend to the heavenly planets where at the exhaustion  of  their
merit they fall back down to the worlds of mortals by  the  descending  path
of <i>dhumah</i> or smoke as directed by a demigod from <i>Pitriloka</i> the realm of  the
forefathers. But those who worship the Supreme Lord Krishna or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations and  expansions  as  revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures
never return to material existence and the world of mortals.
