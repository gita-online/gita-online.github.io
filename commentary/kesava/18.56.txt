Continuing the previous theme Lord Krishna affirms that  actions  which  are
one's natural duty which due to illusion one is  not  willing  do,  will  in
spite of that compel one to do so by  the  predominating  <i>guna</i>  or  mode  of
material nature which will coerce one to do them  anyway.  In  this  present
situation a <i>ksatriya</i> warrior is naturally possesses valour,  courage  and  a
heroic tempermant and are situated in <i>raja guna</i> the mode  of  passion.  This
is not random but follows a thread from previous births. A  <i>ksatriya</i>  cannot
tolerate even the slightest ridicule or insult. So upon hearing the  raucous
insults  about  his  bravery  and  the  degrading  insults  to  his  manhood
dispaging his prowess from the opposing  enemy  a  <i>ksatriya</i>  cannot  refrain
from avenging their honor in battle iregardless the odds.
