Beginning with the word <i>kavin</i> meaning  omniscient  Lord  Krishna  succinctly
defines the characteristics of the Supreme Being to be revealed. He  who  is
<i>puranam</i> or without beginning, <i>anusasitaram</i> or the ruler of all,  <i>acintya</i>  or
inconceivable, <i>dhataram</i> the universal sustainer, <i>aditya-varnam</i> or  effulgent
like the sun. Such a Supreme Being is <i>tamasah parastat</i> or transcendental  to
the darkness of material nature and time, completely different.
