Lord Krishna now elaborates on how <i>sraddha</i> differentiates itself  under  the
auspices of one of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of  material  nature  which  are
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness<i>, raja guna</i> the mode  of  passion  and  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of ignorance. These three archetypes apply to all  beings  and
all things within the material nature. Those who have no  knowledge  of  the
Vedic scriptures and are indifferent to them languish in  <i>tama  guna.</i>  Those
who have some knowledge of the Vedic scriptures yet chose to disrespect  and
oppose them due to insidious motives and nefarious intrigues are  bewildered
in <i>raja guna.</i> Those who faithfully follow the ordinances and injunctions  of
the Vedic scriptures are safely  situated  in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  due  to  having
performed  pious  activities  in  innumerable  past  lives  without  selfish
motivations. There faith is directed to the worship of the Supreme Lord  and
as such is conducive for <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence.
<p>
The inherent characteristics one possesses in present  life  are  determined
by activities performed in previous lives that  were  voluntarily  followed.
These innate characteristics catapult a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being into  one  of
the three <i>gunas</i> and the corresponding type of  faith  one  possesses  is  in
accordance to the <i>guna</i> they are situated in. Such faith regardless of  which
<i>guna</i> gives the confidence that by  it  one  will  accomplish  their  desired
goal.  When  there  is  confidence   in   accomplishing   successfully   any
undertaking, a <i>jiva</i> will engage wholeheartedly in it.  This  is  a  sign  of
faith. But there are  gradations  and  differences  of  quality  in  various
undertakings and these distinctions are what determines whether an  activity
is  in  <i>sattva,  raja</i>  or  <i>tama  guna.</i>  Those  who  have  no  knowledge   of
reincarnation, no knowledge of <i>karma</i> or reactions to actions,  no  knowledge
of the Vedic scriptures, nor knowledge of  the  paramount  position  of  the
Supreme  Lord  Krishna;  are  helplessly  indulging   themselves   only   in
transitory, mundane activities. Such activities no matter how  great,  noble
and well intentioned award no opportunity to free oneself from  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death and achieve <i>moksa.</i>
