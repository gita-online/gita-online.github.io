Now Lord Krishna speaks of the characteristics and nature of the  <i>ksetra</i>  or
field of activity beginning with the words  <i>maha-bhutani</i>  meaning  the  five
fundamental elements being earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are  the
elements comprising material existence  and  these  are  the  elements  that
constitute the physical body.  <i>Ahankarah</i> is the false  ego,  <i>buddhi</i>  is  the
intellect, <i>avyaktam</i> is the unmanifest nature known as <i>prakriti</i> the  material
substratum pervading all physical existence. The five organs  of  perception
for the senses being the five senses: eye, ears, nose, tongue and skin.  The
five objects of the senses being sight, sound, smell, taste  and  touch  and
the five organs of  action  being  the  hands,  the  legs,  the  voice,  the
genitals for procreation and the anus for  evacuation.   These  24  elements
have already been iterated by Lord Krishna millenniums before  in  His  <i>lila</i>
<i>avatar</i> or pastime incarnation as Kapila deva; but here  He  also  names  the
modifications such as desire and aversion as well. Desire is  attachment  to
that which gives happiness and repugnance is aversion to  that  which  gives
misery. Both are mental tendencies formed from a conditioned  perception  of
what is favourable and unfavourable relegated by the <i>karma</i> or  reactions  to
one's meritorious and unmeritorious actions and as they are  caused  by  the
actions of the physical body they are experienced by the  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied
being through contact of the physical  body  as  it  is  the  receptacle  of
feeling for all <i>jivas.</i> The word <i>cetana</i> meaning awareness is apparent in  all
forms and species of life relative to their individual  consciousness.  This
starts with being conscious of food only to being  conscious  of  life  with
its six transformations of birth, infancy,  youth,  maturity,  old  age  and
death; to being conscious of  the  <i>atma</i>  or  the  immortal  soul,  to  being
conscious of a Supreme Lord to being conscious of  loving  devotion  to  the
Supreme Lord Krishna. All these things  have  been  explained  in  brief  as
being part of the <i>ksetra</i> along with the mind, the  senses,  the  objects  of
the senses and the modifications of dsire  and  aversion  which  causes  the
sensations of pleasure and pain for the <i>jivas.</i>
