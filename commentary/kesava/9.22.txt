It has been clearly established by  Lord  Krishna  that  those  who  perform
Vedic rituals with self interest motives are unable to extricate  themselves
from <i>samsara</i> or the endless cycle of birth and death. Whereas  the  devotees
of the Supreme Lord Krishna being completely free  from  self  interest  and
ulterior motives accomplish the four  goals  of  human  existence  <i>artha</i>  or
wealth, <i>kama</i> or pleasure, <i>dharma</i> or righteousness and  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
by the  grace  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself.  The  word  <i>ananyas</i>  meaning
exclusive denotes that such devotees have no other  goal  than  the  Supreme
Lord, thinking only of service to Him day and  night  with  full  heart  and
soul. But because they are so fully devoted to Him they  sometimes  fail  to
take care of the realities of the body, senses and mind and so in this  case
the Supreme Lord  arranges  for  their  maintenance  Himself  supplying  the
necessities they need to exist. He also protects them in all  respects  from
any situation that may obstruct their attainment of Him before  the  end  of
their life.
