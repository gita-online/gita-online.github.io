The Supreme Lord Krishna is the absolute and independent controller  of  all
creation, Every living being depends solely upon  Him  for  their  existence
and maintenance. He is also the absolute and independent  destroyer  and  He
confirms that all the warriors of  the  battle  are  <i>nihatam-purvam</i>  meaning
already slain by His mere desire. Therefore as Lord Krishna  is  the  actual
destroyer Arjuna should arise and defeat his enemies and win  glory  in  the
form of slaying Bhishma, Drona, Karna etc. who were invincible even  to  the
demigods. Vanquishing his mighty foes he and  his  brothers  can  abundantly
enjoy the flourishing kingdom of Earth.  All  the  Kaurava  warriors  Arjuna
will be fighting are already slain  before  he  fights  with  them  by  Lord
Krishna and Arjuna  should  merely  as  a  conduit  be  the  Supreme  Lord's
implement for slaying them. The vocative <i>savya-sacin</i> meaning  expert  archer
reveals that Arjuna is  ambidextrous  and  able  to  discharge  arrows  with
either hand.
