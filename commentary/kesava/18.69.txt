Here Lord Krishna is addressed as <i>acyuta</i> meaning  infallible  one.  This  is
because the omniscient  Lord  Krishna  is  cognizant  of  all  His  previous
incarnations over trillions and trillions of  years  but  Arjuna  could  not
even remember his previous life where Lord Krishna was Narayana and  he  was
Nara and both were celibate sages. The purport is that  Arjuna  was  already
self-realised in the previous life but this  knowledge  disappeared  in  the
present life. Now it was revived again by the knowledge of Srimad  Bhagavad-
Gita imparted by the grace of Lord Krishna. The vocative <i>acyuta</i> denotes  the
reality that by Lord  Krishna's  grace,  His  omniscience,  omnipotence  and
omnipresence as the supreme sovereign,  the  paramount  controller  and  the
sole creator, maintainer, protector and sustainer of all existence.
