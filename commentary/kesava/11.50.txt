Now Lord Krishna is answering why His two-armed human form is so rarely
seen. Although millions and millions of brahmins study the Vedas every day,
that in itself is not enough to qualify themselves to see His enchanting
human form. Likewise neither by executing severe penance, offering
extravagant donations, or performing Vedic rituals perfectly is one able to
see Lord Krishna in His human forms as Arjuna has seen Him.
