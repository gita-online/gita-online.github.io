One should not consider that those votaries  of  the  impersonal  unmanifest
<i>brahman</i> which  is  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  or
seekers of the imperceptible <i>atma</i> or  eternal  soul  who  without  requisite
faith do not propitiate the Supreme Lord Krishna are in any way superior  to
those who perform <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to Him. In  these  two
verses Lord Krishna explains that even those adherents of the Vedic  culture
who are not His devotees that rigidly control  their  senses  from  pursuing
their objects of attraction with equanimity  of  mind  towards  all  because
they behold everything as part of the <i>brahman</i> or  the  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence. This understanding makes them  sympathetic  to  the
well being of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings:  plants,  animals,  humans  and
demigods  while  meditating  incessantly  upon  the  imperceptible  <i>atma</i>  or
eternal  soul  within  themselves  and  within  all  sentient  beings.  Such
aspirants also reach unto the <i>brahman</i> and  are  released  from  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth  and  death  achieving  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material existence. Because the <i>atma</i>  is  eternal  it  is  imperishable  and
different from the physical body which is perishable. Because the  <i>atma</i>  has
a spiritual form it is immutable and changeless whereas  the  physical  body
is changing from birth to death. The conclusion is that the votaries of  the
impersonal <i>brahman</i> who  worship  the  imperishable  unmanifest  attain  that
which  they  meditate  upon  being  the  impersonal  <i>brahman</i>  which  is  the
effulgence of the Supreme Lord's energy and this affirms the  ancient  Vedic
aphorism: As one worships the Supreme Lord so does one become.
