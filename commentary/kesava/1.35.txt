In the  previous  verse  the  effects  of  the  intermixture  of  castes  as
described  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  regarding  the  ancestors  has   been
determined. Now Arjuna describes the misery experienced for  those  who  are
responsible for causing this intermixture of castes  beginning  with  <i>dosair</i>
<i>etaih.</i>  Due to these evils the essential  duties  prescribed  in  the  Vedic
scriptures for the four castes which are the  authorised  and  proven  means
leading humanity to the highest good and which  are  faithfully   instructed
by holy sages and spiritual masters are all forsaken.
