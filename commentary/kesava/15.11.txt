Previously Lord Krishna has delineated the  dual  nature  of  the  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being as either liberated or in  bondage  and  the  means  to  free
oneself from the captivity of <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle  of  birth  and
death. Now in this verse and the next three He reveals some  of  His  divine
glories. Here He illustrates that the sun, moon and fire  are  all  part  of
His divine glory as their illumination manifests from Him and assist in  the
maintenance and preservation of creation. He explains them as a  portion  of
His effulgence to show that they are but a portion of Him. The Supreme  Lord
being pleased by their competence and service in  the  material  worlds  has
enhanced them with His effulgence acccording to their capacity.
