When the mind becomes fixed remaining steadfast then equanimity will  arise.
One  with  spiritual  knowledge  in  transcendent  meditation  realises  the
ultimate truth  perceiving  God  within.  Understanding  this  fully  Arjuna
desirous of knowing the characteristics of such a  being  such  as  the  way
they talk, walk, sit, etc. requests Lord Krishna to reveal to him  what  are
the signs of one stable in transcendence. How was this  state  achieved?  In
the world how does such a one speak and  act.  How  does  such  a  one  move
about. Arjuna asks this question because these things must be different  for
one situated in nescience. To remove the doubt that qualities such as  these
by one of tranquil mind such as Brahma or extremely powerful such as  Shiva,
in addressing Lord Krishna the vocative Keahava is used by  Arjuna.  Why  is
this? The creator and controller of both Brahma and Shiva  is  Lord  Krishna
who imparts spiritual knowledge to them. Thus Lord Krishna must be  accepted
as the sole refuge of all of creation because He is  omniscient,  omnipotent
and omnipresent. This is substantiated  in  the  Vedic  scriptures.  He  who
creates Brahma and sends the eternal Vedas to  him,  He  the  effulgent  and
illuminating light of the soul and the mind  should  be  supplicated  to  in
full surrender for those desiring liberation from  the  material  existence.
From the forehead of He who was mediating on His inner self,  Shiva  of  the
trident was produced. In the smrtis it is  said  that  Ka  is  the  name  of
Brahma and Shiva is  Isa  the  controller  of  all  the  embodied  souls  in
material bodies. Both Brahma and Shiva  are  manifested  from  Lord  Krishna
thus Arjuna has called Him by the name Keshava.
