Lord Krishna now gives the evidence why  <i>bhakti  yoga</i>  or  exclusive  loving
devotion to Him is the panacea for transcending the three <i>gunas</i> or modes  of
material nature and qualify  to  become  elligible  for  the  state  of  the
<i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all existence and attain  Him.  It
is because He is the abode of the <i>brahman</i> which is  the  effulgence  of  His
inconceivable  spiritual  form  and  which  is  a  manifestation   of    His
attributes such as being eternal,  imperishable,  immortal  with  attributes
characterised by <i>moksa</i> or liberation, <i>ananda</i>  or  never  ending  bliss   and
omniscience. Because the Supreme Lord possesses all these, His devotees  who
worship Him attaining Him easily transcend the three <i>gunas.</i>
<p>
In conclusion the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being by attraction of the senses to  the
<i>gunas</i> becomes emershed and entrapped  in  <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual  cycle  of
birth and death. By engaging in <i>bhakti yoga</i> one  is  released  from  <i>samsara</i>
and awarded <i>moksa</i> or freedom from material existence. In this  chapter  Lord
Krishna the bestower of benevolence onto His  devotees,  out  of  compassion
instructed the science of transcending the three modes of material nature.
