Among the various groups of demigods what is named  <i>cosmpas</i>  equals  <i>ca</i>  and
<i>usmapah</i> the forefathers. The Taittriya Upanisad confirms  that  the  <i>usmapas</i>
are part of the <i>pitris</i> or deified ancestors. The Manu  Samhita  III.CCXXXVII
states : The <i>pitris</i> partake of the food that is Vedically  offered  as  long
as the food remains hot, the guests remain silent while eating and the  host
has not requested to know the virtues of the food tasted..
