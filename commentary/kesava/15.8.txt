Lord Krishna further clarifies what objects accompany  the  senses  such  as
the sense of sight, the sense of hearing, etc. The  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul
dwelling in the etheric heart of every <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  being  experiences
hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, touching as  well  as  thinking  through
the mind. It also experiences the functions of  the  vital  organs  such  as
breathing of the lungs and beating of the heart along  with  the  organs  of
locomotion.
