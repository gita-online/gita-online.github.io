Now Lord Krishna extols the glory of one  who  understands  the  reality  of
<i>prakriti</i> or  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical  existence,  the
difference  between  the  material  and  the  spiritual,  the  <i>atma</i>  or  the
localised, individual,  immortal  soul  and  <i>paramatma</i>  the  omniscient  and
omnipresent Supreme Soul present within every <i>jiva.</i>  Understanding  <i>prakriti</i>
means knowing that the three <i>gunas</i> of goodness, passion  and  ignorance  are
the modifications of material nature which cause pleasure and  pain  in  all
<i>jivas</i> or embodied beings whether demigod, human  or  animal.  When  one  has
achieved realisation of the  <i>atma</i>  one  can  realise  the  Supreme  Lord  as
<i>paramatma</i> and with unveiled realisation  all  sins  are  destroyed  and  one
automatically attains <i>moksa</i> or liberation from <i>samsar</i>a the  perpetual  cycle
of birth and death. The Chandogya Upanisad VIII.I  confirms  this  beginning
<i>harih sum atha</i> meaning : In the cavity of the etheric  heart  the  <i>atma</i>  and
<i>paramatma</i> are residing next to each  other;  one  should  surely  understand
that they are what is paramount to be realised.
