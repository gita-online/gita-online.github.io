If by the previous methods of Vedic study and rituals one can not witness
the human form of Lord Krishna then how is it possible to see Him? Lord
Krishna declares that one can have communion with Him only by bhaktya or
loving devotion; but only if it is ananyaya or exclusive, meaning not
divided or shared with anything else. In this way only can He be jnatum or
known in reality. The particle tu meaning but between bhaktya and ananyaya
confirms that exclusive loving devotion is superior to all other means.
Janaka Pandit explains that consciousness is the higher power of the
Supreme Lord and that unconsciousness is His lower power. The Vishnu Purana
VII.V states: Consciousness is the higher principle of the Supreme Lord
whereas unconscious is the lower principle. Those  who are unconscious lack
devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna and are from His lower principle and
thus are not able to perceive Him even by Vedic study and rituals.
