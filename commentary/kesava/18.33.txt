Now Lord Krishna describes the <i>dhriti</i> or determination  that  is  influenced
by <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion. The proposed activity which is engaged  in
for the purpose of reaping the rewards of worldly  enjoyments  and  material
possessions, which is executed with the conception that one is the doer  and
which one is attached to and zealous of such <i>dhriti</i> is  undeniably  situated
in <i>raja guna.</i>
