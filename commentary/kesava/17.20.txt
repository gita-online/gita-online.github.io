In this manner the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature  in  relation  to
Vedic sctivities  has  been  explained  by  Lord  Krishna  emphasising  that
aspirants for <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material  existence  should  only
perform activities characterised by <i>sattva guna</i>  or  mode  of  goodness  and
should avoid activity that  is  characterised  by  <i>raja  guna</i>  the  mode  of
passion and <i>tama guna</i> the mode  of  ignorance.  During  the  performance  of
<i>yagna</i> or propitiation, <i>tapah</i> or austerities  and  <i>dana</i>  or  charity;  if  by
chance  there  is  any  mistake  or  error  in  the  subservient  components
regarding time, place, ingredients and recitation of prescribed  <i>mantras</i>  or
Vedic  chants.  Such  qualified   devotees   firmly   situated   in   <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> possessing  purity  of  heart  derived  from  eating  sanctified  foods
situated in <i>sattva guna</i> and due to performing all activities with <i>bhakti</i>  or
exclusive loving devotion and also because they are  not  expectant  of  any
reward for the <i>yagnas</i> they perform and therefore free  from  any  <i>karmas</i>  or
reactions to actions. Even if  such  a  one  commits  the  sin  of  improper
execution of Vedic rites or incurs the demerits of  lapse  in  attention  or
forgetfulness of ingredients or inappropriate recitation of  Vedic  mantras.
The most merciful Supreme Lord Krishna in order  to  protect  and  safeguard
His devotees from acquiring such sins and demerits instructs  the  utterance
of the three divine syllables OM TAT  SAT  which  bestows  all  virtues  and
blessings and insures protection, and is glorified by the enlightened  sages
and  liberated  muni's  and  by  knowers  of  the  Vedic   scriptures.   The
enlightened agree unanimously  that  OM  TAT  SAT  are  threefold  based  on
similarity of qualities and attributes related to the <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence, related  to  the  Vedic  scriptures  and
related to the Supreme Lord.
<p>
We find that the Taittiriya Upanisad I.VIII.I beginning <i>om  iti  brahman  om</i>
<i>iti sarvam</i> states: OM is the <i>brahman</i> and OM is  the  ultimate.  The  Mundaka
Upanisad II.II.VI  beginning:  <i>om  ityevam  dhyavatha  atmanam</i>  states:  One
should meditate upon OM as representing  the  Supreme  Lord.  The  Chandogya
Upanisad VI.VIII.I beginning <i>sa ya esho anima itad</i>  states:  That  which  is
the fundamental cause of all existence, which is  the  spiritual  substratum
of all existence, which is referred to as Thou  art  that,  is  the  <i>brahman</i>
which manifests from OM whose source is the  Supreme Lord.  The  <i>pranava</i>  OM
is declared to be the name for the personal  aspect  of  the  Supreme  Lord.
<i>Pranava</i> means first breath mad is  the  transcendental  sound  vibration  OM
commencing all Vedic rites<i>.</i> It is from the root <i>prana</i>  meaning  breath.  TAT
is declared to be perfection aspect of the <i>brahman</i> and SAT  is  declared  to
be the creational aspect of the <i>brahmin.</i> They are all  supremely  auspicious
and all Vedic rites begin and end with OM. 
<p>
At the dawn of creation the Supreme Lord emanated the Vedic scriptures,  the
Vaisnava and brahmanas  and  <i>yagna</i>  to  evolve  and  protect  creation.  All
prescribed Vedic rites were originated and ordained by the Supreme Lord.  By
remembering the threefold syllables  OM  TAT  SAT  and  by  vibrating  their
transcendental sound frequency, the potency to neutralise and eradicate  any
inauspiciousness or error in the performance of any  prescribed  Vedic  rite
is activated and no sin is committed nor demerit incurred.  This potency  is
perpetual throughout all eternity and is  solely  available  exclusively  to
the duly initiated Vaisnavas and brahmanas from one of the  four  authorised
<i>sampradayas</i> or  channels  of  disciplic  succession  as  revealed  in  Vedic
scriptures.
