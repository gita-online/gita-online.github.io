The <i>sukham</i> or happiness that is derived  from  sense  gratification  by  the
contact with the objects of the senses such as  sexual  and  sensual  bodily
enjoyments, although seeming to be like nectar in the beginning when  it  is
fresh and newly experienced but later after  habitual  repetition  over  and
over again continuously throughout one's life it  becomes  just  like  venom
yielding unhappiness in this world and the next.  Such  activities  are  for
begetting children in the <i>grihasta ashram</i> or married life  and  perpetuating
the species otherwisw such activites keep on in bondage and  and  hence  are
deplorable. Such <i>sukham</i> Lord Krishna confirms as situated in <i>raja  guna</i>  the
mode of passion.
