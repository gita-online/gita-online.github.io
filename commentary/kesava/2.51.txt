If someone were to enquire that if they perform actions  in  the  prescribed
manner will indifference  to  worldly  topics  come  quickly.  Lord  Krishna
indicates that it is up to the individual by use of the  word  yada  meaning
when. There is no exact time. Whenever one  spiritual  intelligence  revives
itself and allows ones mind to cross over the  gigantic  dross  and  mud  of
mental delusion then and only then one  will  achieve  indifference  to  all
worldly objects that are worthy of hearing  and yet  to  be  heard  and  the
rewards of actions in which to accomplish  them  as  written  in  the  Vedic
scriptures for this world and the heavenly kingdoms.
