It may be even further postulated that <i>paramatma</i> the all  pervading  Supreme
Soul may be existing equally in the <i>atmas</i> or individual  immortal  souls  of
all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings as was  previously  alluded  to  regarding  the
ether. That can be accepted  fully  as  both  the  <i>atma</i>  and  <i>paramatma</i>  are
eternally spiritual; but for the  <i>atma</i>  to  be  like  ether  throughout  the
physical body denotes its omnipresence and thus it is exposed  to  the  pain
and pleasure, joy and despair which the physical body experiences.  Also  by
what  criteria is an <i>atma</i> to be measured. Would the <i>atma</i> of a human  be  too
big for an ant and if subsequently an ant would have to  take  birth  as  an
elephant would its <i>atma</i> be too small? Yet again if  it  is  to  be  accepted
that the <i>atma</i> is sub-atomic in size how will it be  possible  to  experience
pleasure and pain as well as complete body luminosity because as  the  Vedic
scriptures confirm it is residing  in the etheric heart of all <i>jivas</i>?

To alleviate all these doubts and misconceptions, Lord Krishna  the  analogy
that as a  single  sun  is  able  to  <i>prakasyati</i>  or  illuminate  an  entire
universe; in the same way from within the etheric heart the <i>atma</i> is able  to
illuminate the entire physical body by  the  medium  of  consciousness.  The
<i>atma</i> is neither omnipresent nor  modifiable  in  size  not  because  of  the
questions  previously  posed  but  because  of  the  verdict  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. The Mundaka Upanisad  III.I.IX  beginning  <i>eso  anuratma  cetasa</i>
<i>veditavyo</i> states:  The  soul  is  infinitesimal  in  size  and  is  realised
directly by the mind  which  has  neutralised  completely  all  effects  and
influences of the five senses which reveals the enlightenment of  the  soul.
In the Svetasvatara Upanisad V.VIII beginning <i>balagrashata bhagasya</i>  states:
The <i>atma</i> is known to be as subtle as 100th part the size of  the  tip  of  a
hair that again was divided into a 100th parts  which  equals  1/10,000  the
tip of a hair. The  Prashna  Upanisad  III.VI  beginning  <i>hrdi  hyesha  atma</i>
states: The <i>atma</i> resides in the heart where there are 101  <i>nadis</i>  or  nerves
and for each <i>nadi</i> there are 100 sub-<i>nadis</i> and each of  these  sub-<i>nadis</i>  has
72,000 subordinate <i>nadis</i>. The Vedanta Sutra II.III.XXIV   beginning  <i>gunadva</i>
<i>lokavat</i> states: The <i>atma</i> although residing in the heart by  its  quality  of
consciousness illuminates the physical body as a light illuminates  a  room.
So from all these relevant  examples  given  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  all
discrepancies are dispelled.
