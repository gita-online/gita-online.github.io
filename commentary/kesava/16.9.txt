The demoniac constantly besiege themselves with insatiable desires that  are
very difficult to accomplish and then maintain. They are always harassed  by
expectations of success and worried about  the  threat  of  failure  without
discerningly  considering  the  uncertainty  of  life  and  calculating  the
reality that death  may come at any moment. The constant  pursuit  of  power
and wealth in order to enjoy unrestricted sense gratification  is  for  them
the only goal in material existence.  They  are  absolutely  convinced  that
there is nothing superior then the joy of sensual pleasure even  if  enjoyed
over  and  over  and  over  again  without  cessation.  Hence  the  demoniac
mentality itself holds the demoniac tightly in bondage  by  the  innumerable
expectations they harbour from  the  innumerable  desires  they  are  always
hankering for as a result of extreme lust and greed.  So  Lord  Krishna  has
clearly defined the  characteristics  of  the  demoniac  who  by  deceptive,
dishonest and despicable means surreptitiously  manipulate  themselves  into
positions of power  and  control  and  deliberately  contrive  by  vile  and
unrighteous means to usurp the divine order and destroy creation.
