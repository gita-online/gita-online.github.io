Now  Lord  Krishna  elaborates  on  the  threefold  divisions  of  <i>yagna</i>  or
propitiation and worship to the  Supreme  Lord  or  any  of  His  authorised
incarnations and expansions as revealed in Vedic scriptures. The <i>yagna</i>  that
is performed <i>aphala-akanksibhih</i> meaning with  no  desire  for  any  fruitive
rewards and is ordained by the  ordinances  and  injunctions  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. Following the prescribed  procedures,  chanting  the  prescribed
mantras, utilising prescribed  ingredients,  sanctified  by  duly  initiated
Vaisnavas and brahmanas who perform it as either a matter of duty or out  of
devotion to the Supreme Lord are known as situated in <i>sattva  guna</i>  or  mode
of goodness.
