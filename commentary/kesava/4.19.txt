Lord Krishna propounds the  manner  in  which  the  spiritually  intelligent
seeking <i>moksa</i> or liberation act in regards  to  action  and  inaction.  That
person whose every action is free from desire and hankering for  rewards  be
it obligatory or not  obligatory,  daily  or  occasional  even  as  well  on
special days such as festivals for the Supreme Lord's appearance day.  Their
actions are incapable of sprouting reactions as they are free from even  the
thoughts of desire due to being purified by  the  fire  of  knowledge  which
manifests as not desiring the rewards of any action and  this  applies  even
up to the Supreme Lord.
