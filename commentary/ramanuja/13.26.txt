So now the eternal, omniscient and all pervading nature of <i>paramatma</i> or  the
Supreme Soul is being revealed by Lord Krishna  as  being  totally  distinct
from the physical body of the <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being.  Although  residing
within the exhaustible physical  body  which  is  perishable,  <i>paramatma</i>  is
inexhaustible and imperishable due to it being <i>anaditivat</i> of eternality.  It
is infinite  in  time  and  infinite  beyond  time.  It  is  <i>nirgunatvat</i>  or
possessing no material qualities or  attributes  and  neither  performs  any
actions nor is affected or implicated  by  any  actions  the  physical  body
performs. Next it will  be  explained  how  the  <i>paramatma</i>  although  having
constant association within the physical body is not degraded by any of  the
bodily properties.
