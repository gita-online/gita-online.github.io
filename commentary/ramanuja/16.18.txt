The word <i>sastra</i> refers exclusively to the Vedic scriptures. <i>Vidhi</i> means  the
injunctions and  ordinances  within  them.  The  Vedic  scriptures  are  the
Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  mandates.  Whosoever  foolishly   abandons   these
instructions and <i>utsrjya</i> or transgresses the injunctions and  ordinances  to
drift whimsically wherever their desires  aimlessly  take  them  will  never
achieve <i>siddhi</i> or  perfection  beyond  mundane  conceptions,  never  achieve
<i>sukham</i> or happiness of any longevity or <i>param  gatim</i>  the  supreme  goal  of
human existence.
