In the Vedic scriptures the term <i>Prajapati</i> is unrestrictedly  designated  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna, or any of duly authorised <i>avatars</i> or  incarnations
such as <i>Narayana</i> lord of all creation or <i>Jagannatha</i> lord of  the  universes.
In the beginning of creation the Supreme Lord reflected  on  the  plight  of
the living entities entangled in matter from time immemorial.  These  living
entities were destitute of name, form and a distinction between one  another
as they were  dormant  within  a  portion  of  the  Supreme  Lords  potency.
Possessing an eternal soul they had the ability to fulfill great  goals  but
they languishing inert like latent substances.
<p>
In this case <i>Prajapati</i> refers to Brahma, a duly authorised  G<i>una  avatar</i>  of
the Supreme Lord who while reflecting on them out of His infinite mercy  and
for the sake of their ultimate redemption, inspired Brahma to  project  them
into the material manifestation.  Brahma  worshipped  the  Supreme  Lord  as
sacrifice and thus inaugurated the institution of <i>yagna</i> which  will  fulfill
all ones highest ambitions granting <i>moksa</i> or  libeartion  in  the  spiritual
worlds. How this will manifest will be further explained in the next verse.
