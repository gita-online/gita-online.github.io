The three <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature  are  <i>sattva</i>  or  goodness,
<i>rajas</i> or passion and <i>tamas</i> or nescience and  all  arise  from  <i>prakriti</i>  the
material substratum pervading physical existence. The <i>gunas</i> in  actual  fact
are the attributes and qualities of <i>prakriti</i>  and  their  existence  can  be
discerned from the effects that they are responsible for  producing such  as
intelligence, dimwittedness or beautiful, ugly, etc.  These  attributes  and
qualities are in a latent state within material nature when it is  unevolved
but  manifests themselves when in an evolved state.  The  results  of  their
effects is that the immutable <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul  is  <i>nibadhnanti</i>  which
means enslaved by material sentiments of the mind. Due to this the  <i>atma</i>  is
impounded in a body as a captive, forced to be manufactured as a <i>jiva</i> or  an
embodied being and subject to birth and death within the body of a  demigod,
human, animal, fish, etc.  The  characteristics  of  the  individual  <i>guna's</i>
along with their method of imprisoning the <i>jiva</i> is  given  by  Lord  Krishna
next.
