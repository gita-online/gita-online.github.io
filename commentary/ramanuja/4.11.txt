Not only in His unlimited <i>avatar</i> or incarnation forms in the Vedic  pantheon
such as Rama or Buddha is  Lord  Krishna  approachable  to  those  who  seek
refuge in Him as the saviour and maintainer of all creation; but He is  also
the saviour and maintainer of all those outside of  the  Vedic  culture  who
seek refuge and redemption from any other religion or denomination as  well.
By whatever conception the  righteous  choose  to  seek  god,  Lord  Krishna
manifests Himself in that same manner so that He  is  always  available  for
them to approach Him in the manner in which  they  have  chosen.   The  word
<i>bhajamy</i> literally means I give service to  them.  Here  it  means  that  the
Supreme Lord is available to reciprocate with them. Although Lord  Krishna's
divine nature is such that even realised saints and yogis find  His  sublime
nature transcendental to speech and even thought; yet for all those who  are
situated in righteousness even  in  other  religions  and  denominations  He
manifests the way to receive their mode of worship maintaining their  faith.
This manifestation is not only apparent by their faith  but  also  by  their
ability to reciprocate with Him by all their senses in  as  many  variegated
and diverse ways as they are  capable  of.  Bringing  now  to  a  close  the
subject of <i>avatars,</i> the discourse  on  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  the  performance  of
prescribed Vedic activities is resumed. Before presenting the <i>jnana-yoga</i>  or
cultivation of Vedic knowledge aspect of <i>karma yoga</i> or  the  performance  of
prescribed Vedic activities, Lord Krishna first explains  how  rare  is  the
person who performs this type of <i>karma yoga.</i>
