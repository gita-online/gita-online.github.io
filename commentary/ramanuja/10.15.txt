These questions are asked to Lord Krishna by the words  <i>katham  vidyam  aham</i>
<i>yogims</i> meaning how to be able to know and follow <i>yoga</i>  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness, and engage in  constant  meditation  on  Him  with  devotion.
Devotion knowing the Supreme Lord is  endowed  with  the  six  opulences  of
total power, total beauty, total wisdom, total fame, total wealth and  total
renunciation which accompany  His  illustrious  attributes  of  omniscience,
perfection, eternity, sovereignty, majesty etc. Now Arjuna desires  to  know
in what other ways yet untold  is  Lord  Krishna's   <i>vibhuti</i>  transcendental
majestic opulence  displayed  throughout  existence  which  exemplifies  His
Supreme eminence and paramount position as the ultimate  controller  of  all
creation.
