The  phrase  <i>vyasa-prasadat</i>  means  by  the  grace  of  Krishna   Dvaipayana
Vedavyasa the author of Vedanta Sutras, the Puranas, Mahaharata,  etc.  This
grace gave Sanjaya celestial vision and clairaudience to  directly  see  and
hear all that transpired on the battlefield and thus he was able  to  recite
verbatim the divine  discourse  spoken  by  Lord  Krishna  known  as  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita exactly as Lord Krishna originally revealed it.
