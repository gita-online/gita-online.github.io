The intellect of one who even has  understanding  of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation becomes clouded by the eternal enemy known as <i>kama</i> or  lust  and
which generates fascination and excitement for enjoying the objects  of  the
senses. The word <i>duspurena</i> means insatiable, it can never be  satisfied.  It
constantly hungers for sense gratification even if  it  is  inaccessible  to
get and impossible to have  still  <i>kama</i>  yearns  for  it.  It  is  <i>anala</i>  or
inexhaustible as nothing ever completely satisfies  <i>kama</i>  permanently<i>.</i>  When
the object of its desires has been acquired  and the senses fully  gratified
then at once <i>kama</i> wants more and  looks  for  something  new.  It  is  never
satisfied. In what way <i>kama</i> utilises itself to envelope  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul
Lord Krishna reveals next.
