Lord Krishna begins this verse with the word <i>sruti. Sruti</i> refers to  Vedanta
which implies <i>sravanam</i> or hearing from them. For it is  by  the  hearing  of
transcendental instructions that  the  mind  is  evolved  as  it  begins  to
reflect and  contemplate  on  the  immortal,  incomparable  and  exceedingly
subtle nature of the eternal soul.  When this consciousness which is by  its
very nature is steadfast and stable is firmly rooted within a mind  purified
of all dross and selfish actions, then at that time one shall  achieve  yoga
and  realise  enlightenment.  The  understanding  is  that  by  practice  in
performing  activities  in  the  selfless  parameters  of  karma-yoga   with
knowledge of the eternal soul as revealed in the Vedic  scriptures  develops
an  illumination  in  consciousness  called  sthita-prajnata  and  that   by
sustained effort of this  consciousness  one  is  gradually  achieves  self-
realisation. Hearing this Arjuna next desires to understand  the  components
of this unique consciousness. Is it  achieved  by  willpower,  by  yoga,  by
knowledge of the soul, by detachment or is it a combination of  all  of  the
above? This Arjuna will question in the next verse.
