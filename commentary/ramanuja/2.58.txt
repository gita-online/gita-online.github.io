Sensual objects of enjoyment are fuel for the senses.  Lord  Krishna  states
that the desire for these sensual objects departs when one starves  them  by
restraining the senses from indulging in them. But although  the  action  is
restrained the craving remains subtly within the mind.  <i>Rasa</i>  is  taste  and
<i>raga</i> is attachment. So the craving attachment for  taste  of  sense  objects
remains present. However when the eternal nature of the soul is realised  in
all its glorious splendour and it  is  seen  that  it  is  infinitely   more
attractive than the most delightful sense object. At that  time  all  desire
for sense objects completely vanishes along with the residue of craving.
