Sanjaya frankly speaks to Dhritarastra at this time saying that Arjuna,  who
is  the most noble minded, the most compassionate, the eternal  well  wisher
and the most virtuous; although frequently fraught with  difficulties  along
with his four brothers, instigated by thee and  thy  son,  including  horrid
acts of treachery against them with intent to kill, such  as  attempting  to
burn  them  all  alive  in  a  specially  made  house  of  combustible  lac,
administering poison and other unworthy deeds  as well. It is  surely  known
to you that by Arjuna  the destruction of all your clan is  certain  due  to
the fact that  he  has  the  support  of  the  <i>Parama  Purusa,</i>  the  Supreme
Personality, <i>Lord Krishna</i> Himself, by his side.

Still Arjuna looks upon you all with feelings of friendship and overcome  by
compassion and by the fear  of  performing  actions  which  are  opposed  to
righteousness, that tiger among  men  became  introvert  and  said  to  <i>Lord</i>
<i>Krishna</i> that under no circumstance  would  he  fight.  After  saying  so  he
became very dejected in mind and afflicted with  grief  at  the  thought  of
seperation from relatives  and  dropping  his  celestial  bow  reknowned  as
<i>Gandiva</i> he just sat down on the chariot.
