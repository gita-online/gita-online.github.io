The reality  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  transcendence  to  both  the
<i>ksarah</i> or perishable which includes all  <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings  as  well
as <i>aksarah</i> or imperishable including all the <i>atmas</i> or immortal souls. He  is
celebrated and gloridied as <i>Purusottama</i> the Supreme  Being.  The  word  <i>loke</i>
obviously means worlds but due to its proximity to <i>vede</i>  meaning  the  Vedas
it can refer to the <i>smriti's</i> such as the Vishnu Purana  V.XVII.XXXIII  which
states: Incarnations of <i>Purusottama</i> descending from  Vishnu  are  without  a
beginning, middle or end. An example from <i>sruti</i> is  the  Chandogya  Upanisad
VIII.XII.III beginning: <i>evamevaisa samprasado asma charirat samuthaya  param</i>
states: Achieving liberation the spiritsoul  attains  a  glorious  effulgent
form revelling in its position at the feet  of  the  Supreme  Being.  So  in
conclusion  <i>loke  vede</i>  can  mean  that  the  Supreme  Lord  celebrated   as
<i>Purusottama</i>  is glorified in both sections of the Vedic scriptures known  as
<i>sruti</i> and <i>smriti</i> and it can mean that He is glorifeied in all the worlds.
