The three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature all arise from <i>prakriti</i>  or  the
material substratum pervading physical existence  from  which  the  physical
body manifests. When the <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  transcends  them  all  and
realises the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul which is of the nature of infinity.  Such
a being attains <i>moksa</i> and is liberated from <i>samsara</i> or the  perpetual  cycle
of birth and death and all  misrey  and  sorrows  associated  with  material
existence. At the time one achieves <i>atma-tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation,  one
assumes a spiritual body that is immortal. This  is  what  Lord  Krishna  is
declaring.
