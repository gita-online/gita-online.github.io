The point Lord Krishna is emphasising is that even before the demise of the
physical body if the aspirants for moksa or liberation follow this
procedure they will meet with success. This means that whoever is able to
gratefully glean any experience of the atma or soul and by this is able to
thwart the onslaught of kama or lust and krodha or anger can be considered
to be yuktah or in harmony with the Supreme Consciousness and qualified to
perform yoga or the science of the individual consciousness attaining
communion with the ultimate consciousness and by this becomes immersed in
the bliss of the atma upon departing from the physical body.
