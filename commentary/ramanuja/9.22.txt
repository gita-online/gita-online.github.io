The word <i>ananyas</i> meaning exclusivity  refers  to  those  who  have  excluded
themselves from all other desires except the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  who  is
their sole source of joy and only center of  hope.  Always  meditating  upon
Him day and night in terms of his qualities and pastimes as well as what  He
may be doing and  reflecting  in  relation  to  them.  Deprivation  of  such
meditation and reflections would be tantamount to cessation  of  their  very
lives, hence incessant remembrance of the  Supreme  Lord  is  wonderful  for
them in and of itself.  The  <i>mahatmanas</i>  or  great,  noble  beings  of  this
description who devoutly contemplate the Supreme Lord in all His  glory  and
splendour as the source of all glory and  splendour  throughout  the  cosmos
all over creation and  furthermore  who  contemplating  Him  thus  intensely
aspire for eternal communion and association  with  Him.  Then  the  Supreme
Lord Himself accomplishes that <i>yoga</i> or the  attainment  of  the  individuals
consciousness in communion with the  His  ultimate  consciouness.  The  word
<i>kseman</i> means perpetually this denotes that it is eternal and indicates  that
there is no return back to the material existence for those  so  exclusively
devoted.
