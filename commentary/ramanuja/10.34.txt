Lord Krishna reveals that of cheaters His <i>vibhuti</i> or divine,  transcendental
opulence is gambling the art of plundering those who cheat. His  <i>vibhuti</i>  is
victory  for  the  victorious  and  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  is  perseverance  for  the
enterprising . The word <i>sattvam</i> refers to goodness  and  of  those  who  are
good, His <i>vibhuti</i> is the magnanimity and goodness they possesses.
