Now Lord Krishna states that the <i>buddhi</i> or intellect of those in  <i>tama  guna</i>
or mode of ignorance are enveloped in the darkness  of  consciousness.  What
they perceive is a distortion of reality.  They  think  what  is  worthy  is
worthless and what is worthless is worthy, what is fact is fiction and  what
is fiction is fact what is inferior is superior and what  is  superior  they
consider inferior.  They are easily led astray having no grasp of truth  and
no scope for what is real  and  what  is  unreal  and  thus  endlessly  they
revolve in <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death..
