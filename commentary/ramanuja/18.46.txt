The conclusion Lord Krishna gives for this subject is that actions that  are
initiated naturally and easily executed and are beset with  no  difficulties
should be done even if there may be some fault or defect. The inner  purport
is that even those situated in <i>jnana yoga</i>  or  facilitating  communion  with
the Supreme absolute by knowledge, they too should adopt the path  of  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> or facilitating communion with the Supreme  absolute  by  actions.  All
endeavours in the material world are accompanied by some sort  of  fault  or
defect and  all  living  beings  must  perform  actions  to  exist  but  the
following of one's own natural path is not in the least difficult  or  beset
with unpredictable dangers. Whereas the standard of <i>jnana yoga</i> being  higher
the possibility of mistake and the chance of defect is greater  as  well  as
the demerit incurred. So <i>karma yoga</i> is encouraged.
