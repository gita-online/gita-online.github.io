The word <i>jnana</i> means knowledge relative  to  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul.  The  word
<i>vijnana</i> is transcendental knowledge based on realisation of the  <i>atma</i>.   The
word <i>trptatma</i> means one who is exclusively satisfied with  these  two  forms
of knowledge. The word <i>kutastho</i> refers to one who is perpetually  consistent
and unwavering amidst the variable and ever changing  phenomena of  material
existence. One who is  absorbed  in  the  eternal  nature  of  the  <i>atma</i>  is
<i>kutastho</i> and hence <i>vijitendrah</i> or one who has all the senses under  complete
subjugation. Such a person realising the <i>atma</i> and  perceiving  its  distinct
superiority to matter  is  never  again  infatuated  with  the  delusion  of
material pleasures  and  sense  gratification.  Thus  all  material  objects
whether they are gold or a clod of earth are of  equal  value  and  material
activities cease to give any pleasure seeking importance.  Such a person  is
known as <i>yuktah</i> meaning one in communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness
and is a fit candidate to commence perfection of meditation which  leads  to
realisation of the Supreme Being. This is the purport of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna.
