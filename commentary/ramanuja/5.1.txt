In the fourth chapter <i>karma yoga</i> or  the  performance  of  prescribed  Vedic
activities was delineated by  Lord  Krishna  with  special  emphasis  of  it
containing spiritual intelligence. In the third chapter it  was  shown  that
even those who follow the path of <i>jnana yoga</i> or  the  cultivation  of  Vedic
knowledge  that  <i>karma  yoga</i>  when   performed   as   a   matter   of   duty
<i>without</i> attachment was preferable.  This is because in <i>jnana yoga</i> the  level
of <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation contained within each  action  determines
individual success; whereas <i>karma yoga</i> is  easy  to  perform  and  does  not
depend on <i>atma tattva</i> for success. In this chapter  <i>karma yoga</i>  is  examined
in its efficacy of expeditiousness in achieving <i>atma  tattva</i>  in  comparison
to <i>jnana yoga.</i> Also will be illustrated how this  should  be  performed  and
the eliminating the conception that one is  the  performer  along  with  how
<i>jnana yoga</i> is perceived from this standpoint.

Renunciation and the cultivation of  Vedic  knowledge  is  <i>jnana  yoga.</i>  The
performance of prescribed Vedic activities is <i>karma  yoga.</i>  In  chapter  two
Lord Krishna declared that <i>karma yoga</i> was worthy to  be  followed  by  those
seeking <i>moksa</i> or liberation from  the  cycle  of  birth  and  death  in  the
material existence and as the mind was subsequently purified  of  all  dross
then <i>jnana yoga</i>  would  naturally  be  embarked  upon  bringing  about  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva.</i> But in chapters three and four Lord  Krishna  explained  that  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> was preferable to even for onme qualified to  perform  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  and
futhermore that <i>karma yoga</i> was sufficient in and of itself to  achieve  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> without the help of <i>jnana yoga.</i> So the  conclusion  to  be  given  is
which of the two is absolutely superior and the best means to  achieve  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva.</i>
