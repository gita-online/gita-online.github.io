In the first six chapters  of  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  comprising  the  first
division known as  the <i>Karma Yoga</i>  section  which  is  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness  by  the  performance  of  prescribed  Vedic  activities  with
detachment.  There  the  subject  matter  primarily  delineated   was   with
reference to how an aspirant may achieve <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation  of  the
soul by adopting the path  of  <i>karma  yoga.  Atma-tattva</i>  is  essential  and
ancillary to constant devotion and the continuous  meditation  necessary  by
which communion with the Supreme Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His  authorised
incarnations and expansions as revealed in Vedic scriptures as well  as  His
eternal associates. He is the ultimate and the supreme goal to be  attained,
one without a second and worthy of everyone's endeavour for devotion to.  He
is <i>Parabrahma</i> the Supreme Being. He is <i>niravadya</i> or perfect, He is the  sole
causeless cause of the entire creation and the total  cosmic  manifestation.
Omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, infallible  and  eternal.  The  Supreme
Soul  of  all  living  entities  and  the  Supreme  Controller  for  all  of
existence.
<p>
Now the middle section of six chapters from seven to twelve  comprising  the
second division of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita known as  the  <i>Bhakti  Yoga</i>  section
which is the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion
with the ultimate consciousness by loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.  The
subject matters revealed are the nature of <i>Parabrahma</i> the Supreme  Being  of
All, <i>Parama Purusa</i> the Supreme Spirit of all and the  method  and  modes  of
loving devotion and meditation are to be offerred to Him. This is  known  as
<i>bhakti.</i> The mode of such devout love called  <i>bhakti</i>  is  summarised  in  the
final chapter eighteen, with the verses XXXXVI where  Lord  Krishna  states:
That humans attain perfection by rendering devotional  service  to  the  all
pervasive  Supreme  Lord  from  whom  all  created  beings  have  come  into
existence and from whom all created beings receive their life  impulses.  In
verse LIII He states: That being completely detached from all  designations,
free from false ego, lust for  power,  arrogance,  desire  and  anger  while
being completely equipoise and peaceful internally one becomes  eligible  to
realise and experience the <i>Brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence. In verse LIV He states that when situated in  the  state  of  the
<i>Brahman</i> one laments not and craves not and thus being joyful obtains  <i>bhakti</i>
to the Supreme Lord.
<p>
This constant state of meditation  in  devout  love  for  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  as  revealed  in  the  Vedic
scriptures is known as <i>bhakti</i> and constitutes the method and means by  which
to attain communion with the Supreme Lord.  This  is  confirmed  in  various
Vedic  scriptures.  In  the  Svetasavatara  Upanisad,  III.VIII  it  states:
Meditating on Him solely one crosses over the ocean  of  mortality.  In  the
Taittiriya Upanisad III.II it states: The knower of the Supreme  Being  thus
becomes immortal. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad II.IV it states:  The  <i>atma</i>
or soul alone is to be intently contemplated on for deliverance and  in  the
same scripture beginning at I.IV it states:The  omniscient  <i>atma</i>  itself  is
the worshipable goal to attain. In  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  it  states:The
mind being pure, meditation is stable, with concentration  fixed  all  knots
are untied.
<p>
The Mundaka Upanisad II.II it states: The knot of the heart is cut  asunder,
any lingering doubts are dissolved, all reactions to actions are  terminated
to one whom the Supreme Lord has manifested within their  heart.  The  words
<i>bhakti</i> meaning loving devotion and  <i>dhyana</i>  or  meditation  and  <i>upasana</i>  or
divine ecstasy and other similar terms are synonymous and indicative of  the
continuity and potency of remembrance and reflection through realisation  of
the <i>atma</i>  on the Supreme Lord so intensely that  one  flows  into  communion
with Him as an actual perceptive experience. In the Katha Upanisad  II.XXIII
it  states  that:  Not  by  deliberation  is  the  <i>atma</i>  perceived,  nor  by
concentration, neither by erudite knowledge. The <i>atma</i> is  perceived  by  one
in whom the Supreme Lord Himself elects to reveal His  essence.  This  verse
conclusively confirms that the path of <i>Bhakti Yoga</i>  is  of  an  ecstatically
joyful experience which induces  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself  to  blissfully
reciprocate with such a felicitous  devotee  being  that  he  has  made  the
Supreme Lord the sole object of his love.  So  it  can  be  understood  that
<i>upanasa</i> or divine ecstasy is non-different from <i>bhakti</i> or  loving  devotion.
That the terms <i>upasana</i> and <i>bhakti</i> are equivalent in  all  respects  is  also
evident from  other  Vedic  passages.  In  the  Taittirya  Upanisad  III.VII
beginning <i>tam nanyah pantha ayanaya vidyate</i> it states: One who has  realised
the Supreme Being becomes immortal then and there, no other  path  to  <i>moksa</i>
or liberation exists. In VI.LIII of the  same  scripture  beginning  <i>na  ham</i>
<i>vedaih</i> it states: Not only by knowing the Vedas or  performing  austerities,
or giving gifts or the performance of <i>yagnas</i> or worship in propitiation  can
the Supreme Lord be perceived. And in VI:LIV beginning <i>bhaktya  tu  ananyaya</i>
it states: By loving  devotion  exclusively  is  the  Supreme  Being  to  be
perceived and  known.
<p>
Thus the seventh chapter beginning the second division  of  Srimad  Bhagavad
Gita which is the <i>Bhakti Yoga</i> section delineates:
<p>
1) The essential nature of the <i>Paramapurua</i> or Supreme Spirit  as  an  object
of meditation<i>.</i>
2) The mystification of the Divine nature by the veil of material nature.
3) The resignation of oneself to the Supreme Being  in  order  to  transcend
this veil.
4) The classification of the aspirants who have chosen the path of <i>bhakti.</i>
5) The  pre-eminence  among  them  of  those  who  are  the  Supreme  Lord's
devotees.
<p>
The  words  <i>mayy-asakta-manah</i>  denotes  one  whose  mind  is  affectionately
focused on the Supreme Lord Krishna. So much so is one attached to  Him  and
so impassioned is their love for Him that that if one feels  separated  from
Him for even a moment either by being without His close proximity or by  the
entrance into the mind of any thoughts not relevant  to Him; or if one  were
to temporarily not remember Him for any reason, that would  subsequently  be
the cause of such a person to consider their whole life as meaningless.  The
words <i>mad-asrayah</i> means complete dependence upon the  Supreme  Lord  without
whom one could not even exist.
<p>
Next learn about how one who joyfully engages in <i>Bhakti Yoga</i> with  a  loving
heart in transcendental ecstasy will realise the Supreme Lord as  He  is  in
all His splendour and glory.
