<i>Bhagavad-Gita: c</i><i>hapter 2, verse 37</i>
<p>
If in fighting for righteousness Arjuna is slain in the battle then he  will
attain superior bliss in the heavenly spheres; but if he  is  victorious  in
battle by the slaying the miscreants  then  he  will  find  himself  in  the
position of unrivalled enjoyment and rulership of earthly royalty.  Dividing
and  conquering,  defending  and  ruling   are   the   natural   duties   of
<i>ksatriya</i> royalty. Discharging these duties  with  no  anticipation  for  the
fruits  of  the  results  will  be  the  means  by  which   Arjuna   attains
unparalleled bliss. So Arjuna should properly prepare his mind  for  war  by
fortifying  himself with the firm conviction that embarking  on  the  course
of a righteous war is the guaranteed means  for  him  to  achieve  <i>moksa</i>  or
final salvation which means precisely the embodied soul  becoming  eternally
liberated from the fetters of material existence  and  which  is  without  a
doubt the great hurdle to be overcome in human existence. Arjuna  is  called
here <i>Kaunteya</i> to remind him that such conduct is indeed representative as  a
son of the great devotee Queen Kunti. Next  will  be  revealed  the  apropos
mentality of a living entity aspiring for salvation.
