The word <i>vimudha</i> used by Lord Krishna means the ignorant, the  fools,  those
who misconceive the outer, corporeal body to be the <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul
and who do not perceive that the <i>atma</i> is conjoined  with  matter,  bound  to
limited conditions of space and time in various forms of existence as  <i>jivas</i>
or embodied beings exist. Such bewildered <i>jivas</i> never can detemine  how  the
<i>atma</i> enters or how it  departs  with  an  embodied  being.  Neither  can  it
ascertain how although abiding within it is distinctly  different  from  the
<i>jiva</i> nor understand how  the  <i>atma</i>  is  experiencing  that  which  the  <i>jiva</i>
enjoys. Yet those who are <i>jnana-caksusah</i> or endowed  with  spiritual  wisdom
and  enlightened  realisation  can  perceive  the  <i>atma</i>  existing   in   its
essential nature within their own  etheric  heart  and  within  the  etheric
heart of every <i>jiva.</i>
