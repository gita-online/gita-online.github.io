The word <i>sadhunam</i> meaning virtuous refers  to  the  sadhus  or  the  saintly
devotees, the eminent Vaisnavas who diligently seek refuge in  Lord  Krishna
in every thing they think and do. These persons  feel  that  without  seeing
and perceiving  the  Supreme  Lord,  without  chanting  His  names,  without
continuously  reminiscing  over  His   phenomenal   pastimes   and   without
meditating on Him that there lives are devoid and empty  and  they  find  it
difficult to even carry on their existence. There are even those  with  whom
a single moment of absence from  the  Lord  is  like  a  lifetime.  For  the
protection of these virtuous and holy beings, lest they in  their  agony  of
separation from me expire from this world, Lord Krishna bequeaths upon  them
the privilege of being able to perceive  His  confidential  appearances  and
pastimes  and partake in communion with Him. So  in  summary  the  following
reasons of Lord Krishna's <i>avatars</i> or incarnations is: 1) for protecting  the
virtuous 2) for destroying the  wicked  3)  for  re-establishing  <i>dharma</i>  or
eternal righteousness which had become obscured. As <i>dharma</i> to all beings  is
factually the primary mode of worship for the Supreme Lord Krishna  and  His
authorised <i>avatars</i> in order to attain <i>moksa</i> or salvation from the  cycle  of
birth and death in the  material  existence;  it  should  be  known  as  the
highest good for all beings. The words <i>yuge yuge</i> meaning from millennium  to
millennium is to indicate that the Supreme Lords incarnations may appear  at
anytime not being limited to a particular <i>yuga.</i>
