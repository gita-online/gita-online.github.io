Desires are of a two-fold nature. <i>Sparsa-ja</i> which arise  from  the  impulses
of the physical body or and <i>sankalpa-ja</i> which arise  from  the  impulses  of
the mind or mental origin. <i>Sparsa-ja</i> includes desires for cold or  for  hot,
or for sweet or for  salty,  or  the  lack  of  such.  <i>Sankalpa-ja</i>  includes
desires for wealth, fame, dominion, progeny and such. With great  effort  it
is possible to abandon the desires of the mind by avoiding  to  think  about
them. It is also possible to resist the  sensations  of  pleasure  and  pain
with an attitude of indifference; but between the two  the  desires  of  the
mind are more easy to abandon because  it  is  not  possible  to  avert  the
sensations of  the  body.  Thus  it  is  necessary  to  comprehensively  and
systematically neutralise  the  senses  from  their  external  corresponding
sense  objects.  This  should  be  undertaken  gradually  by  degrees   with
determination and a resolute will. Then in due course of time the mind  will
be weaned from all things except the  eternal  <i>atma</i>  or  soul  and  absorbed
exclusively in the <i>atma,</i> one thinks of nothing else.  This  is  the  meaning
Lord Krishna intended.
