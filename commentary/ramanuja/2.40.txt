<i>Bhagavad-Gita: c</i><i>hapter 2, verse 41</i>
<p>
The Supreme Lord Krishna is reaffirming that  the  science  of  <i>yoga</i>  rather
than the various methods of action prescribed in  the  Vedic  scriptures  is
the one path that has  guaranteed  certainty.  The  word  <i>vyavasaya</i>  derived
from <i>nischaya</i> means certainty. The unshakeable conviction one has of such  a
decisive nature is that which the aspirant of salvation possesses and  which
can be understood  by  the  actions  they  perform.  The  strength  of  this
unshakeable conviction is directly connected to one's understanding  of  the
eternal reality of the soul's immortality. Fragmented  and  not  evolved  is
that mind which entertains ideas of performing actions for  the  reaping  of
results. People of this type vaguely know that  the  soul  exists,  although
mistakenly attributing it as being part of the body and  no  more  knowledge
is required in their case as their material wishes for wealth and  fame  and
even heaven can be obtained without having accurate,  precise  knowledge  of
the actual transcendental position of the eternal soul.
<p>
But on the  other  hand  the  conviction  of  certainty  is  unique  in  its
singleness of purpose and focused  aim.  All  actions  executed  by  such  a
living entity has for its sole objective salvation and  the  means  is  <i>yoga</i>
which is the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion
with  the  Ultimate  Consciousness.  This  is  the  essence  of  the   Vedic
scriptures which lead to this conclusion and such being the case  there  can
arise only one unshakeable conviction to one possessing  spiritual  insight.
<p>
<p>
For the fulfilment of one single attainment being salvation all actions  are
dedicated by one fixed in the firm  resolve  for  salvation.  Hence  as  the
primary objective of the Vedic  scriptures  is  one,  the  firm  resolve  as
regarding the purpose of all actions can be but  one  as  in  the  case  for
example of the six different kinds of rituals called <i>Darsa-purnamasa.</i>  Three
rituals are to be performed on the new moon and three are  to  be  performed
on the full moon. In  their  performance  they  all  differ  in  regards  to
execution yet they may be said to constitute a single aim for when  all  are
directed to obtaining a single fruit all there seperate differences  may  be
understood as part of a whole.
<p>
Whereas in the case of those with fragmented and unfocused minds who  engage
in various activities each intended to acquire some result such  as  heaven,
wealth, fame, power and so forth and so on the schemes are  endless  as  the
desires are endless. Even the results are diverse as in the  case  again  of
the <i>Darsa-purnamasa,</i> for although the rituals are directed to  be  performed
for the obtainment of a specific goal, yet they  confer  minor  benefits  as
well such as good health, vigor and long life. Thus it is  stated  that  the
mentality of those not evolved is endless and ramifying.
<p>
The conclusion of this verse is that  all  <i>nitya</i>  or  daily  rites  and  all
<i>naimittika</i> or occasional rites for specific times prescribed  in  the  Vedic
scriptures shall be performed with the sole aim  of  ultimate  salvation  as
the purpose. Although each rite individually is capable of  giving  its  own
temporary, material reward; but all such rewards are  to  be  ignored  while
holding focus solely on salvation.
<p>
As for fruitive rites and rituals desiring some material benediction,  these
shall be performed in the manner prescribed for the four <i>varnas</i>  or  classes
of cultured life being brahmana, <i>ksatriya</i>, vaisya, and  sudra  in  the  four
<i>asramas</i> or stages of cultured  life  being  <i>brahmacarya</i>  or  celibate  life<i>,</i>
<i>grihasta</i> or married life<i>, vanaprastha</i> or renunounced life  and  <i>sannyasa</i>  or
dedication and focus solely on the Supreme  Lord.  Accordingly  they  should
also resign the acquired results of their efforts in favor of salvation.
<p>
In the next three verses will be  seen  that  those  who  engage  solely  in
fruitive activities are condemned.
