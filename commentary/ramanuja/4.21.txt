Here Lord Krishna uses the  word  <i>nirasir</i>  means  bereft  of  expectancy  or
devoid of all desires for rewards. The words <i>yata-cittatma</i> means to  control
the mind by the power of the <i>atma</i> or soul, keeping  the  mind  tranquil  and
equiposed, free from  agitation.  The  words  <i>tyakta-sarva-parigrahah</i>  means
abandoning all cravings for sense objects and sense pleasures.  As  long  as
one has life one should perform all actions as a matter of duty merely as  a
function of their body; in this way there are no reactions  to  actions  and
no disease is incurred. One will be free of this. The disease is <i>samsara</i>  or
repetitive bondage of birth and death in the material  existence.  If  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic activities are  performed  in  this  way  by  those
seeking <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from  <i>samsara</i>  this  in  itself  is  sufficient
enough to lead one to <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of  the  soul,  eliminating
the necessity of having to engage in the  intermediate  step  of  performing
<i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of Vedic  knowledge  by  strictly  controlling
the senses and the cessation of actions.
