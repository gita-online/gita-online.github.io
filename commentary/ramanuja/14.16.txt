Thus result of those situated in <i>sattva guna</i> or  mode  of  goodness  at  the
moment of death is birth in a family of enlightened  transcendentalists  who
are <i>atma tattva</i> or knowledgeable of  the  immortal  soul.  Such  a  virtuous
being performs all actions without any  motive  for  rewards  but  only  for
devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna. The result of  such  actions  is  only
increasing one's <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to  the  Supreme  Lord.
Purity means the absence of any pain so say sages who are in a  position  to
know such matters. The result of those situated in <i>raja guna</i> or the mode  of
passion at the moment of death is birth among those prodiguous families  who
only perform  activities  desirous  of  rewards.  They  actually  engage  in
actions with  the  sole  intent  of  enjoying  the  results  themselves  and
gratifying their dependents and then again and again embarking on  more  and
more ventures developing more and more passion as they  do.  Hence  do  they
perpetuate a mountain of <i>karma</i> or reactions to  actions,  some  good  giving
pleaure  and  some  bad  giving  pain.  Thus  they   perpetuate   themselves
permanently into <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and  death.  Similarly
the result of those situated in in <i>tama guna</i> or the  mode  of  ignorance  at
the moment of death is inertia, nescience, darkness of knowledge.
