Beholding the phenomenal but terrifying form of Lord Krishna's visvarupa or
divine universal form, fully satisfied the curiosity of Arjuna but his mind
was filled with fear. So he humbly requests Lord Krishna with salutary
exclamations of devasa jagan-nivasa meaning O Lord of lords, O refuge of
creation. The word prasida means to please be magnanimous and transform
Himself back into that benign form he was accustomed to see.
