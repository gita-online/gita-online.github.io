If one is unable to focus their mind steadily on the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
without distraction and interruption then one should continuously  endeavour
to perform <i>abhyasa yoga</i> which is repeatedly fixing the mind on  the  Supreme
Lord while simultaneously restraining  oneself  from  all  worldly  affairs.
Reflecting  on  Lord  Krishna  being  the  quintessence  of  all   wonderful
qualities  and  exalted  attributes  such  as  love,   beauty,   compassion,
sweetness, wisdom, majesty, courage, valour, etc. while  realising  that  He
alone is the Supreme Lord of the spiritual kingdom and the  material  worlds
being the ultimate source and the ultimate goal of all things  at  the  same
time being  the  antithesis  and  antidote  of  all  that  is  demoniac  and
unrighteous. True endeavour for the Supreme  Lord  is  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive
loving devotion to Lord Krishna. By remembering  and  meditating  constantly
on Him in this way, steadiness and equanimity of mind is  achieved  and  one
will directly realise themselves how to attain Him.
