The Supreme Lord Krishna explains some of His  potencies  that  through  the
sun and fire He is <i>tapami</i> or causes  heat  and  He  withholds  and  releases
rain. He is <i>amrtam</i> or immortality being by which the  world  exists.  He  is
also <i>mrtyus</i> or death that by which this world becomes  destroyed.  Never  in
contradiction the Supreme Lord is <i>sat</i> or that existence  which  manifest  in
the present time and <i>asat</i> or that existence which is unmanifest  in  present
time but which existed in the past and which may  manifest  in  the  future.
Thus Lord Krishna  exists  in  every  reality  as  the  sum  of  all  things
intelligent and unintelligent which compose  His  transcendental  body.  The
<i>mahatmanas</i> or great, noble beings referred to in  verse  13  are  those  who
meditate on the Supreme Lord as the unity, manifesting itself  in  corporeal
multiformity and variegatedness   throughout  creation  in  the  macrocosmic
sense. So in order to more fully understand the attributes  of  the  Supreme
Lord characterized by the <i>mahatmanas</i> and the method they  commune  with  the
Supreme Lord has been depicted. Next will be described the behavior  of  the
ignorant who full of desires covet enjoyment.
