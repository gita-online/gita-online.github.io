The words <i>asurim yonim</i> means demoniac wombs and refers  to  birth  of  those
<i>jivas</i> or embodied beings and even subtle existences that  are  diametrically
opposed to the divine will of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Those of a  demoniac
nature  never  have  an  affinity  or  even  tolerance  for  the   path   of
righteousness and so they spawn and are  hurled  into  wombs  of  lower  and
lower degraded demoniac forms as their reward  to  increase  their  venomous
delusion. As such the words <i>aprapya eva</i> means that the  demoniac  can  never
attain the Supreme Lord and denotes that they  are  never  imbued  with  the
intelligence to have the  consciousness  to  seek  the  association  of  the
Vaisnavas or exclusive devotees of  Lord  Krishna  and  learn  the  ultimate
truth submissively from them. Where after by  receiving  the  mercy  of  the
Vaisnavas devotees they would gradually become  sanctified  and  after  many
births eventually achieve the qualifications necessary to be accepted  as  a
disciple of a Vaisnava devotee who guides them on the path  to  the  Supreme
Lord. Otherwise without this  eternal  process  it  is  impossible  for  the
demoniac to ever receive the opportunity to attain  Lord  Krishna  and  thus
they slip deeper and deeper into  the  darkness  of  ignorance  birth  after
birth after birth after birth.

The root cause by which those of a  demoniac  nature  lose  their  paramount
position as human beings imbued with free will  and  self-determination  and
instead sink into the instinctive  consciousness  of  animal  and  reptiles,
descending further into insects, worms and maggots is revealed next.
