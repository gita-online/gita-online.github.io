Whosoever who has  developed  and  evolved  their  consciousness  to  become
spiritually intelligent enough to realise Lord Krishna's  paramount  supreme
position as the creator, maintainer, sustainer  and  pervader  of  all  that
exists knows everything essential which means everything that is to be  know
as the means to attain Him by the fact that one knows.  Such  a  one  serves
the Supreme Lord in every way which means whatever  ways  of  worship   have
been ordained to attain Him such a one has  accomplished  them  by  dint  of
this service. By realising Lord Krishna  thus  as  <i>Purusottama</i>  the  Supreme
Being of all beings and devoted exclusively to Him one is assured  His  love
and protection the same  which  may  be  gained  by  various  activities  of
service and worship to Him that are revealed in the Vedic  scriptures.  Thus
this aforementioned knowledge of <i>Pususottama</i> has been duly eulogised.
