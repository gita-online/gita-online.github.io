The words <i>sarvendriya-gunabhasam</i> means that the source  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or
spiritual substratum pervading all existence  known  as  <i>Parabrahma</i>  or  the
Supreme  Being  who  is  capable  of  illuminating  all  the   senses   with
consciousness along with their faculties such as sight, sound, smell,  taste
and touch, etc. But devoid of all material qualities <i>Parabrahma</i>  is  capable
to perform all the activities of the senses without  the  need  of  physical
sense organs. The same holds true for the <i>atma</i> or  immortal  soul  which  is
capable  of  experiencing  the  activities  of  the  senses  without   sense
faculties and which by its own virtue has the capacity of  omniscience  like
<i>Parabrahma.</i>  The  word  <i>asaktam</i>  means  indifferent  or  unattached  to  the
material and yet is <i>sarva-bhrt  ca</i>  or  capable  of  assuming  all  physical
bodies and is the maintainer of all physical bodies. The Chandogya  Upanisad
VII.XXV beginning <i>sa eva dhastat</i> meaning the Supreme Lord is  everywhere  in
all directions. The Supreme Lord is    <i>nirgunam</i>  meaning  transcendental  to
the three modes of material nature pervading material  existence  which  are
goodness, passion and ignorance  and yet the Supreme Lord  is  the  ultimate
experiencer of these three modes.
