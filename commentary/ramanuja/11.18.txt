Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form is infinite  being  devoid
of beginning, middle or end. The word  <i>ananta</i>  means  unlimited  and  <i>viryam</i>
means  powerful  so  the  <i>visvarupa</i>  is  unlimitedly  powerful  without  any
restrictions.  Other  qualities  are  also  implied  by   <i>ananta</i>   such   as
cognizance, dominion, might, strength, etc. The words  <i>ananta-bahum</i>  meaning
unlimited arms also infers unlimited  hands,  chests,  legs,  feet,  etc  as
well. <i>Sasi-surya-netram</i> means eyes like the sun and moon.  The  moon's  rays
denote the cool gentle beaming look that gladdens  as  it  shines  upon  the
Supreme Lords servitors the demigods and  His  votaries  the  devotees  with
compasssion. The sun's glowing  rays  denotes  the  hot,  burning  eye  that
scorches the inimical hosts of <i>asuras</i> or demons and <i>raksasas</i> or  devils  who
are devoid of righteousness to  others.  <i>Dipta-hutasa-vaktram</i>  meaning  with
fire emitting from their mouths denotes the fire  of  universal  destruction
contained within the bosom of time raged therein. <i>Sva-tejasi</i> means  dazzling
splendour and unprecedented radiance  which  illuminated  everything  around
it. This glorious life giving energy  flows  unrestrictedly  throughout  all
the universes.

Arjuna is  explaining  that  he  has  seen  the  reality  of  the  <i>visvarupa</i>
according to the manner in which  Lord  Krishna  deigned  to  teach  him  by
exhibiting the <i>visvarupa</i> in before him and  practically  demonstrating  that
He is the complete creator, the complete sustainer, the total refuge of  all
and the absloute destroyer as well as being the receptacle  for  all  divine
qualities and transcendental attributes  such  as  omniscience,  omnipotence
and omni-presence. The question may arise as  to  how  is  it  possible  for
unlimited bodily parts to be functioning all in  one  body.  The  answer  to
this would be that one can  imagine  a  single  bodily  midsection  of  vast
proportions with unlimited chests, arms, hands  necks  and  heads  branching
upwards from it in every direction and with every head having two eyes,  two
ears, a nose and a mouth. Also branching downwards in every direction it  is
possible to imagine unlimited legs and feet as well. So this  conception  is
clearly not an impossibility and seeing it along with  choice  demigods  and
exalted liberated beings they were all inspired with awe and reverence.
