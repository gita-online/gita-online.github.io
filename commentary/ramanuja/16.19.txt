<i>Sastra</i> meaning the Vedic scriptures is the sole absolute  supreme  authority
deciding all matters of existence guiding all creation as to what is  to  be
done and what is not to be done. What the ordinances and injunctions of  the
Vedic scriptures enjoin along with their auxiliaries such  as  the  Puranas,
Upanisads, Itihasas, etc reveals that the highest truth is the Supreme  Lord
Krishna,  that  all  activities  should  be  engaged  in  as  devotion   and
propitiation to Him and  that  this  in  itself  constitutes  the  means  of
attaining Him. Realising these  ultimate  truths  to  be  absolute  reality,
nothing more is required and one should sagaciously act with full  faith  in
accordance therewith.
