All the lights  which  illuminate  all  the  worlds  such  as  suns,  moons,
lighning, fire reflect the light of consciousness bestowed  by  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna as integral parts of  creation.  His  effulgence  was  bestowed
upon them being pleased by their service of universal management and by  the
propitiation from their personified forms  such  as  <i>Surya</i>  the  demigod  in
charge of the sun, <i>Agni</i> the demigod in charge of fire, <i>Soma</i> the  demigod  in
charge of the moon, etc.
