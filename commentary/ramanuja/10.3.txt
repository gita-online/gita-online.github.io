One who is never born is <i>ajam</i> or without birth. This attribute connotes  the
Supreme Lord Krishna as contra-distinguished from the transitory  insentient
matter and the sentient beings bound by <i>samsara</i> or the  perpetual  cycle  of
birth and death. The term <i>anadim</i> meaning  without  beginning  differentiates
the Supreme Lord from the  <i>muktas</i>  or  liberated  beings  in  the  spiritual
worlds who although having become birthless did  have  a  beginning  at  the
time of their liberation. The nature of liberation implies being freed  from
bondage  at  some  time  and  is  thus  characterised  by  previously  being
associated with the material  manifestation  and  duality.  Hence  the  term
<i>anandi</i> denotess that the Supreme Lord never had contact or association  with
duality and materialism due  to  the  fact  that  He  is  transcendental  to
duality and everything material, The Svetasvatara Upanisad VI.XIX  beginning
<i>niravadyam</i> meaning  the  Supreme  Lord  is  perfection,  confirms  this.  it
sometime had to be freed from a  state  of  bondage.  Thus  the  spiritually
intelligent among mortals are those who realise that  the  Lord  Krishna  is
the Supreme Lord over all other gods and lords  being  completely  different
from them in essence and in  substance.  The  spiritually  intelligent  also
realise that Lord Krishna  is  the  antithesis  and  eternally  contrary  to
anything associated with  evil  and  unrighteousness.  The  word  <i>asammudhah</i>
means those who are not  deluded,  alluding  to  the  spiritual  intelligent
which comprises being free from  the  illusion  of  perceiving  anything  as
equal to the Supreme Lord, being free from the illusion  of  believing  that
anything is separate from the Supreme Lord and being free from the  illusion
of not identifying oneself as being an  eternal,  infinitesimal  portion  of
the Supreme Lord. Thus one who is <i>asammudhah</i> is free from  the  defects  and
impediments of <i>karma</i> or reactions to sinful actions which is great  obstacle
in the development of <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.

Another angle of vision is that as in the world  the  emperor  although  the
most powerful monarch amongst humans, he still is like  all  others  subject
to old age, disease and death. Yet  he  has  been  awarded  emperor  by  the
Supreme Lord due to some act of merit. This holds true also  for  Indra  the
king of all the demigods and even higher with Brahma the  architect  of  the
material existence, both were also awarded their posts by the  Supreme  Lord
as a result of great acts of merit.  Although  they  live  for  millions  of
years by Earth time calculations for them it is as 100 years and at the  end
of that time they die also and transmigrate into  another  form  in  another
existence. Even  exalted  beings  come  under  the  three-fold  <i>bhavanas</i>  of
material existence being <i>karma  bhavana</i>  like  Janaka  and  others,  <i>brahman</i>
<i>bhavana</i> like Sanaka and Sanatana and <i>ubhaya bhavana</i> like Brahma himself  and
are  subject  to  birth  and  death  according  to  their  acts.  The  Vedic
scriptures confirms this.  In  Vishnu  Purana  VI.VII.IIL  it  states  that:
Therefore  they  are  all  accountable  for  their  acts.  The  Svetasvatara
Upanisad VI.VIII states: <i>Yo  brahmanan  vidadhati</i>  meaning  He  who  creates
Brahma. This also applies to any mortal who  has  acquired  the  eight  main
<i>siddhis</i> or perfections such as <i>anima</i>  or <i>manima</i> etc.

But the Supreme Lord is <i>loka-maheshvaram</i> the Supreme Lord of all  beings  in
all worlds.
<p>
<p>
<i>Loka</i> is the total cosmos being the aggregate total of  all  sentient  and
non-sentient categories in  conditions  of  inactive  latency  or  active
patency. The sentient includes both  <i>muktas</i> or liberated beings  as  well
as <i>baddhas</i> or not liberated beings. So all  this  is  under  the  Supreme
Lord's control and rule.
<p>
<i>1) Maha</i> is greatness and consists of the Supreme Lord being the storehouse
of unlimited attributes of glorious qualities and His always being the
eternal antithesis of all that is unrighteous, demoniac and evil.
<i>2) Isvarah</i> means Lord as being the supreme, sovereign ruler eternally,
independent of all.
<p>
Thus the Supreme  Lord  is  completely  unlike  all  others,  singular  unto
Himself alone, independent and superior to all. One who does not  incur  the
error of including the Supreme Lord Krishna amongst all  the  various  other
lesser gods and who understands Him to be the sole cause,  the  sole  source
and the sole origin of all creation, verily realises Him and  by  His  grace
is relieved from all reactions to previous actions.
<p>
Thus by illustrating how meditation on the factual absolute  nature  of  the
Supreme Lord removes the obstacles impeding  the  blossoming  of  <i>bhakti</i>  or
loving devotion  unto  the  Supreme  Lord  causing  such  <i>bhakti</i>  to  become
inaugurated; Lord Krishna will next explain how <i>bhakti</i> may be  activated  by
deep and profound meditation on His sublime transcendental divine  qualities
and attributes.
