The potency of unwavering meditation and  <i>pranayama</i>  or  breath  control  by
which one enables and directs all the energies of  the  mind   and  controls
the senses is an auxillary of <i>yoga</i> the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion with the ultimate consciousness and is the only means of <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation  from  material  existence.  <i>Bhakti  yoga</i>  is  exclusive   loving
devotion to the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  authorised  <i>avatars</i>  or
incarnations as revealed in Vedic scriptures. This is  absolutely  the  only
way one may be freed from the enslavement of <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle  of
birth and death. There is no  other  alternative.  <i>Bhakti</i>  is  glorious  and
sanctified, bestowing beatific bliss upon the performer and  blessings  upon
all creation and is the only means for attaining the ultimate  goal  of  all
existence. On who has cast all other conceptions and designations  far  away
and exclusively engages in <i>bhakti yoga</i> to the Supreme Lord with their  mind,
senses and body has their <i>dhriti</i> or determination situated fully  in  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of goodness.
