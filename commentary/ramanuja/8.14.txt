The word <i>nityasah</i> or always means  always  since  the  aspirant  consciously
devoted themselves to Lord Krishna as the exclusive goal. The  word  <i>satanam</i>
or continuously means at all times. The word <i>smarati</i> or remembering  implies
that the Supreme Lord has  become  the  sole  object  of  intense  love  and
devotion so much so that the instant one is  bereft  from  thought  of  Him,
one's very life feels it is in jeopardy. So one incessantly  meditates  upon
Him. The words <i>nitya-yuktasya yoginah</i> is the enlightened one who yearns  for
eternal relationship with Lord Krishna. This is  the  <i>jnani</i>  or  knower  and
lover of god to whom the Supreme Lord is very easily  accessible.  What  the
<i>jnani</i> seeks for his goal is the Supreme Lord only  and  nothing  else.  This
means that it is not the elevated state  of  consciousness  of  the  Supreme
Lord that the <i>jijnansur</i> seek or the state  of  unlimited  fortune  like  the
Supreme Lord that the <i>arthathis</i> or seekers of fortune desire.  The  goal  of
the <i>jnani</i> is to obtain eternal relationship with the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
or any of His authorized <i>avatars</i> or incarnations and expansions as  revealed
specifically in the Vedic scriptures.

The Supreme Lord is <i>sulabhah</i> or easy to achieve. This means Lord Krishna  is
happily available and accessible to all those who  are  devoted  to  Him  in
love and further more He, Himself  is unable to  bear  any  separation  from
His devotees at any time. Therefore it is He who chooses  to  be  associated
with them and this is the confidential <i>tattva</i> or  truth.  By  so  doing  the
Supreme Lord Himself  quickly  carries  to  perfection  by  inspiration  and
intuition the very method that His votary is performing for  attaining  Him.
The Supreme Lord Himself removes all obstacles which may hamper  His  chosen
votary from swiftly progressing to Him simultaneously  while  generating  an
increase in His devotees love for Him  to  propel  Him  onwards.  The  Katha
Upanisad II.XXIII beginning <i>yam evaisha  vrinute  tena  labhya</i>  states:  The
Supreme Lord is attainable by him alone whom He, Himself elects.  This  will
be explained further in chapter X, verses X and XI  but  now  the  remaining
verses in this chapter will be focused on showing that there  is  no  return
to <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of birth and death for the  <i>jnani</i>  who  is
the knower and lover of the Supreme Lord nor is there  any  return  for  the
<i>jijnansur</i> who has achieved <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation; but there  is  a
return to <i>samsara</i> for the <i>arthathi</i> or seeker of wealth  for  they  have  not
qualified for <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence.
