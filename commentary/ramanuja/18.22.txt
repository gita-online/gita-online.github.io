Lord Krishna uses the word <i>niyatma</i> meaning consistency  and  refers  to  the
regulated performance of prescribed Vedic activities as  a  matter  of  duty
according to <i>varnasrama</i> the position and status one is situated in  society.
The words <i>sanga-rahitam</i> means free from attachment and egoism  that  one  is
the doer. The words <i>araga-dvestha</i> mean devoid of attraction to  fame,  power
and an enjoying nature as well as void of aversion for defeat,  failure  and
obscurity. Acts performed without a mentality  of  attraction  and  aversion
are without vanity and ego and bereft of desire for  <i>phala</i>  or  rewards  and
are firmly situated in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
