Weapons are powerless to inflict any injury by cutting or piercing, fire  is
powerless to burn, water is powerless to wet and air  is  powerless  to  dry
the eternal soul. The soul having the  propensity  of  pervading  everything
being capable by its  nature  of  interpenetrating  all  substances.  It  is
subtler than any substance and no substance can penetrate  it.  The  effects
of cutting, burning,  soaking,  drying  and  others  which  takes  place  by
weapons, fire, water, air and the rest penetrate the  object  which  is  the
focus of their direction; but due to its  impregnable  nature  the  soul  is
uninfluenced being beyond the scope of the material  substratum.  Hence  the
eternal soul is unchangeable, immovable and everlasting.
