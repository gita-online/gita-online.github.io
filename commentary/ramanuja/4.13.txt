The entire  material manifestation from Brahma down to a blade of grass  has
been divided by Lord Krishna into the four-fold divisions in  accordance  to
their natural dispositions and qualities. For humans  they  are  <i>brahmin</i>  or
the priestly class, <i>kshatriya</i> the royal warrior  class,  <i>vaisya</i>  the  farmer
and trading class and <i>sudra</i> the servant class. This is in  conformance  with
their material  natures  being  in  goodness,  passion  or  nescience  which
subsequently qualifies them for the type of occupation they engage in  their
life. Creation implies all the universes where He sustains and maintains  as
well causing them to manifest and unmanifest. Although He is the  origin  of
all these activities He should be known as  not  being  the  doer.  This  is
because  the  wondrous  activities  to  be  found   in   creation   although
originated from Lord Krishna do not bind him as He  is  not  the  doer.  The
wonderful variety of creation from demigods, humans, animal etc. are  beings
created by the effects of their own <i>karma</i> or present reactions  to  previous
actions either by merits or demerits. In as much  as  one's  own  activities
determines their  <i>karma</i>  activating  what  reward  or  punishment  one  will
receive; then this is totally determined by each individual  themselves  and
thus Lord Krishna is no way answerable  to  the  reactions  living  entities
bring upon themselves  by  their  actions.  There  is  another  reason  Lord
Krishna is not the doer as well and that is all the embodied being  assuming
various and diverse forms  get  endowed  with  limbs  and  senses  to  enjoy
material  objects  being  interested  in  the  rewards  of  their   actions.
Consequently pursuing this they trap themselves in <i>samsara</i> or the  cycle  of
birth and death in the material existence. It is all of their own doing  and
Lord Krishna is not responsible for the desires the living  entities  choose
to pursue. In the Vedanta-Sutras which are aphorisms  exegetic  of  the  108
Upanisads by Vedavyasa it states in II.III.XXXIV that: The Supreme Lord  can
never be reproached for what seems to be partiality  and injustice  seen  as
rewards and punishments  because  the  results  for  all  human  beings  are
determined solely by their actions. In the act of manifesting  the  creation
Lord Krishna is the original source but the instrumental cause  is  <i>prakriti</i>
or material nature itself and the determining factor for all beings is  that
they come into their various existences as a  result  of  their  own  <i>karma.</i>
Except for the will from the original source of Lord Krishna no other  cause
is needed to  manifest  myriad's  of  marvellous  creations  represented  by
unlimited and diverse  variegated  beings<i>.</i>  This  is  because  all  embodied
beings accept a form in accordance to the inherent  primal  force  of  their
past <i>karma</i>.
