The words yo'ntah-sukho means one who internally happy by atma tattva or
realisation of the eternal soul. This happens after one has neutralised and
evaporated all desire for external pleasure of objects of the senses.  The
word antararamas is one who delights internally meaning that atma tattva
has the capacity ba its inherent qualities to enhance spiritual bliss. One
who is thus illumined from within by the eternal atma is a yogi or one
following the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion
with the ultimate consciousness and such a being is situated in the Brahman
or spiritual substratum pervading all existence and surely achieves moksa
or liberation from the material existence.
