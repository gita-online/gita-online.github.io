Whosoever devotes themselves to contemplation of  the  <i>atma</i>  will  certainly
<i>prapnuvanti</i> or attain the Supreme Lord which means that  by  realisation  of
the <i>atma</i> is essentially realising an essence of the Supreme  Lord  which  is
like unto His essence as <i>paramatma</i> the  Supreme   Soul  within  the  etheric
heart of all living entities. This is what is affirmed later in chapter  14,
verse 2 with the words <i>mama sadharmyam agatah</i> meaning endowed  with  a  form
similar to the Supreme Lords. The Mundaka  Upanisad  III.I,II,III  beginning
<i>niranjanah paramam samyam</i>  states:  Absolved  from  all  sins  one  achieves
sublime similarity with the Supreme Lord. Also  in  Mundaka  Upanisad  I.I-V
beginning <i>atha para yaya tad aksharam adhigamyate</i> which means: Now that  the
higher science by which  the  <i>aksara</i>  can  be  reached.  <i>Parabrahma</i>  or  the
Supreme Lord Himself is also designated by the word <i>aksara</i>  for  He  is  the
source of all beings. That the  Supreme  Lord  is  known  as  <i>Parabrahma</i>  is
confirmed as distinct from the <i>atma</i> will be explained later in  chapter  15,
verse 17. But those who minds  are  attracted  to  <i>avyakta</i>  the  unmanifest,
impersonal <i>brahman,</i> their tribulations  and  difficulties  are  great.  This
includes those who meditate upon the <i>atma</i> as  well  for  the  meditation  of
controlling the mind to  think  of  all  activities  in  relation  to  one's
individual  <i>atma</i>  without  being  able  to  imagine  it  in  any  way  while
performing physical and material activities is tantamount to great  struggle
and futile results.

It will be shown next how devotees of the Supreme Lord Krishna are  superior
being better equipped by <i>bhakti</i> to attain communion with the Supreme Lord.
