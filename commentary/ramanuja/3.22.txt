Lord Krishna is declaring that in all the three worlds if He by His  Supreme
Will were to be present in the guise of a human or demi-god or  whatever  He
desired there would of course  be no activity He would be bound  to  perform
as He is the  maintainer  of  all  the  worlds  and  the  Supreme  Lord  all
prescribed activities in the Vedic  scriptures  are  for  His  pleasure  and
satisfaction solely. Yet even when he appears  in  His  original  two  armed
form or in any of  His  scriptural  authorised  incarnations,  Lord  Krishna
still applies Himself in all kinds of actions for the ultimate  benefit  and
welfare for all the worlds.
