After attentively surveying the army of  the  Kauravas  arranged  in  battle
formation, Arjuna the son  of  Pandu  on  whose  flag  bears  the  image  of
Hanuman, who set the kingdom of Lanka  ablaze,  requested  <i>Lord  Krishna</i>  to
place their chariot between the two opposing armies. Requested whom?  Arjuna
requested  no  lesser  peronality  than  the  Supreme  Lord   Himself,   the
treasurehouse  of  such  attributes  as  wisdom,   strength,   sovereignity,
eternality,  omnipotence  and  splendour.  Whom  by  His  will  created  the
complete  cosmic  manifestation  in  its   triple   aspect   of   inception,
preservation and dissolution for His own pleasure as in sport.
<p>
The Supreme <i>Lord Krishna</i>, Hrsikesa, the master of the  senses.  The  Supreme
Controller, internally and externally of all living  entities  evolving  and
evolved. Who although the Supreme Lord of all, yet descended down  to  Earth
out of His causeless mercy for the  redemption  of  the  faithful  and  even
more, He condescended to be Arjuna's chariot driver, carrying out  his  wish
to station their chariot in such a commanding position  as  to  be  able  to
readily view the belligerent Kauravas  and  put  within  the  range  of  his
vision such heroes as Bhishmadeva, Dronacarya and Kripa  and  the  Kings  of
royal dynasties. At that time the Supreme <i>Lord Krishna</i> said to  Arjuna:  see
what chances there are for the Kauravas victory over thee.
