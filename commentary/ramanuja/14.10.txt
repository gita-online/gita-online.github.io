Lord Krishna confirms the fact that the three <i>gunas</i> or modes  of  <i>sattva</i>  or
goodness<i>, rajas</i> or passion and <i>tamas</i> or nescience are  the  three  qualities
that exist within all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings in  the  material  existence.
But owing to <i>adrishta</i> which is conditions imposed by  the  effects  of  past
<i>karma</i> or reactions to actions and determined as well by the  types  of  food
that were chosen to eat in sustaining the  physical  body  in  the  previous
life<i>.</i> Based upon this assessment any of three <i>gunas</i> may be dominant or  they
may neutralise each  other  or  they  may  be  antagonistic  to  each  other
depending upon which mode is more present and dominant within a  <i>jiva.</i>  This
being the  reality  it  can  be  inferred  by  knowledge  and  discerned  by
witnessing the visible effects of the three <i>gunas</i> as manifested  within  any
<i>jiva</i>.
