In this verse  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  depreciates  Arjunas  ill  timed
despondency and advises him to discard it and prepare himself to  fight  for
lamentation has no place on the battlefield, is not approved  by  the  wise,
is not conducive  to  heavenly  pursuits,  is  inglorious  and  ignoble  and
appears due to weakness of heart.
<p>
Arjuna  still  unable  to  apply  the  Supreme   Lord  Krishna's   sagacious
counselling due to being afflicted by sentiments of friendship and pity  and
due to the horror of  possibly  committing actions which may be contrary  to
righteousness. Arjuna being unclear as to what is right and  what  is  wrong
sought guidance thus.
