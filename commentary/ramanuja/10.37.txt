The <i>bijam</i> or root seed in all things  and  all  beings  which  causes  their
appearance in whatever condition they may exist are all  manifested  by  the
Supreme Lord Krishna. Whatever the composite total of all beings in  all  of
existence without Lord Krishna's manifestation as the <i>atma</i> or  eternal  soul
within every living entity, there can be no possibility of existence in  any
manner of form. Lord Krishna exists in all things so  this  means  that  all
things are always bonded to Him. It  is  evident  from  this  that  what  is
intended to be shown by <i>samanadhi-karanya</i> or co-existence of  substance  and
attribute as one object is the reality of the Supreme Lord  residing  within
all beings as the purely spiritual eternal soul. So it is apparent that  all
things have only their relative existences in relationship  to  the  Supreme
Lord.
