The path of light is the archi-adi being illuminating and the path of
darkness is the dhumadi or smoke. One who at death is guided on the path of
light does not return to the worlds of mortals; but one who is at death
guided on the path of darkness does return and must be reborn again. The
path of light is dual for two types of aspirants being: the jnani the god
seeker and the jijnasuh the soul seeker. The path of darkness is singular
is for the atharthi or fruitive seeker who performs meritorious activities
with the desire to reap the benefits and rewards in the hereafter. Thus two
paths are given for the three types of aspirants. The Chandogya Upanisad
V.X.I-III states: Those aspirants who have realized the atma or soul and
those who in seclusion meditate with faith and devotion on the omnipotent,
omniscient and omnipresent Supreme Lord enter the archi-adi path of light
and do not return. Those aspirants who in their daily affairs devote
themselves to Vedic rituals, public works, charity and philanthropic
activities as well as other pious acts, all enter the dhumo the path of
darkness and must return.
