Continuing further with  this  theme  Lord  Krishna  reiterates  that  still
others who are incompetent to follow the paths of <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness which lead to <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation  of  the  soul.  They
must hear from the Vaisnavas the devotees of the  Supreme  Lord  and  follow
the teachings of the sages and  munis  who  are  established  in  truth  and
righteousness. Then they can begin to traverse the path  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or
devotional activities and then onto  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  the  perfecting  of  Vedic
knowledge, etc. and commence actual contemplation of the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal
soul. Also those who cannot even do that but are able to have faith in  what
they learn from superiors, they get purged of their sins  and  absolved  can
gradually embark upon the path of <i>karma yoga</i>  and  thus  eventually  surpass
<i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death. The  word  <i>api</i>  denotes  the
levels of competency that different gradations of human beings posess.

Next in order to discriminately comprehend the exact position  of  the  <i>atma</i>
residing within the <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being  perpetually  within  material
existence it  is  emphasised  that  whatever  comes  into  existence  either
movable or immovable is the product of the union of  the  sentient  and  the
insentient known as <i>chit</i> and <i>achit</i>.
