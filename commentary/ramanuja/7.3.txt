Humans are designated to act in  accordance  with  the  injunctions  of  the
Vedic scriptures.  Thousands may be found that adhere to the injunctions  of
the Vedas but hard to find is one who adheres and perseveres until the  goal
is reached and perfection is achieved. Of thousands who may  be  found  that
fortunately have sustained their efforts and are persevering until the  goal
is reached and perfection is  achieved  there  is  scarcely  one  discovered
among them who knows the Supreme position of Lord  Krishna  and  offers  all
their activities to Him. And of thousands who may know His supreme  position
it is extremely rare to find one who knows Lord Krishna as He really is  and
offers themselves in loving devotion to Him.
