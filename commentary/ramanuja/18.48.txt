The  perfection  achieved  by  consistent  performance  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>   or
facilitating communion with the Supreme Lord by prescribed Vedic  activities
allows one to attain <i>dhyana</i> or meditation on Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations and expansions as revealed in Vedic scriptures  with
<i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion. Lord Krishna is inviting one  to  learn
how, in what manner and  by  what  conduct  one  attains  the  the  <i>atma</i>  or
immortal soul and the  pure,  consciousness  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence which are the two manifestations  of  the
Supreme Lord who is  the  paramount  of  attainment  and  the  goal  of  all
endeavours.
