Living entities like human beings  though  eternally  existing  due  to  the
auspices of each one's eternal soul have an unknown origin before  birth,  a
manifest condition from birth to death  and  proceed  again  to  an  unknown
existence at  the  termination  of  the  physical  body.  Such  alternations
constitute material existence and are a natural  law.  This  then  gives  no
cause to grieve. Having just shown that even if one  erroneously  was  under
the misapprehension that the physical body itself and the eternal  soul  are
the same; there is still no reason to grieve as in the next verse 29  it  is
declared that very rarely is a person found who would see,  hear,  converse,
or who could be convinced about the wonderful nature  of  the  eternal  soul
which is factually distinct from the physical body.
