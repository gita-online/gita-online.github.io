Lord Krishna gives further characteristics  of  the  spiritually  qualified.
The words <i>brahma-bhutah</i> means comprehending the eternal nature of  the  <i>atma</i>
or immortal soul, the infinite nature of its consiousness and its  essential
relationship with the Supreme Lord. This essential relationship consists  in
realising that one is dependent upon the Supreme Lord  in  every  aspect  of
existence and to be grateful to Him for everything. The word <i>prasanna</i>  means
pure hearted, lucid and clear internally, uncluttered by turbid and  painful
experiences. <i>Na socati</i> means does not grieve. <i>Na  kanksati</i>  means  does  not
crave. Since all the love  that  such  an  aspirant  feels  is  totally  and
exclusively for the Supreme Lord. The  only  grief  such  an  aspirant  ever
experiences is separation from Lord Krishna and the  only  craving  such  an
aspirant ever experiences  is  communion  with  Lord  Krishna.  <i>Samah</i>  means
equanimity and as such looks  at  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings  equally,
knowing the <i>atma</i> resides  equally  in  all.  It  also  can  manifest  as  an
attitude of indifference to anything not related  directly  to  the  Supreme
Lord, avoiding  mundane  actions  and  shunning  worldly  attachments.  <i>Mad-</i>
<i>bhaktim</i> means exclusive loving devotion unto the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  in
the form of sublime and exquisite bliss occasioned by  the  <i>atmas</i>  rapturous
communion with Him, the Supreme Lord of all lords. The sole creator  of  the
cosmic manifestation, its evolutions, progressions and dissolutions. Who  is
the absolute antithesis to all that is evil. Who is the root source  of  all
creation  and  the  depository  of   boundless,   unlimited   and   glorious
illustrious attributes and qualities. Who is  united  with  <i>Sri  Laksmi</i>  the
goddess of fortune. Who is the epitome of beauty and the sovereign of  every
<i>jiva</i>  being  the  source  of  every  <i>atma.</i>  Lord  Krishna  is  the   supreme
attainment,  transcendental,  all  pervading,  omnipotent,  omniscient,  far
beyond material nature.
