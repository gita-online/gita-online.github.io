One who performs <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic  activities  without  desire
for rewards is the one who factually fulfils the sacred canons of the  Vedic
scriptures which are actually the method of worshipping  the  Supreme  Lord.
By such worship one becomes <i>visuddhatma</i> or of purified intelligence  and  is
<i>vijitatma</i> or of controlled mind being absorbed in such worship and  by  this
absorption one is <i>jitendriyah</i> or of restrained  senses.  Such  a  person  is
<i>sarva-bhutama</i> or one who realising their own <i>atma</i>  or  soul  and  perceiving
the <i>atma</i> in all beings as being the  same  <i>atma</i>  existing  within  unlimited
variegated forms. Such a person views all beings not by the  manifest  forms
they exhibit in their lifetime; but  rather  the  intrinsic  nature  of  the
eternal <i>atma</i> within which is the essential nature of all embodied beings.  A
person situated in this consciousness is never infatuated or deluded by  the
erroneous idea of thinking that a temporary material substance can  ever  by
equated to the eternal soul. Such a person  due  to  this  understanding  is
never bound by actions although performing activities and  in  a  relatively
short time achieves <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul.  As  <i>karma  yoga</i>
has been declared to be easy to perform and soon to  reach  fulfilment,  the
means required to enable one to accomplish it Lord Krishna describes next.
