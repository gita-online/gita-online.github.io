Lord Krishna is stating that over eating and too little eating  as  well  as
extreme activity and complete inactivity are all detrimental to <i>yoga</i> or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness. The same applies for excessive sleep and not  enough
sleep as well as over indulgence in work which causes exhaustion  and  hence
idleness. To that person who is disciplined in eating habits  and  exercise,
who is regulated in sleep and waking then  meditation  becomes  the  panacea
for life's afflictions and the royal path out  of  <i>samsara</i>  or  the  endless
cycle of birth and death.
