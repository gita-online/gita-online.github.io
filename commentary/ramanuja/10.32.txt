Lord  Krishna  reveals  that  of   destroyers   His   <i>vibhuti</i>   or   divine,
transcendental opulence is <i>mrtyuh</i> or death, the great terminator of life  in
all material existences. Of the eight transformations of physical  existence
His <i>vibhuti</i> is the first known as birth. And  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  is  all  of  the
seven feminine perfections being  <i>kirtih</i>  or  exalted  reputation,  <i>srir</i>  or
lustrous beauty, <i>vak</i> or  articulate  speech,  <i>smrtih</i>  or  excellent  memory,
<i>medha</i>  or  discerning  intelligence,  <i>dhrtih</i>  or  fortitude  and  <i>kasma</i>   or
forgiveness.
