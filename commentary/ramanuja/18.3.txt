Kapila Muni the  founder  of  the  <i>Sankhya</i>  philosophy  which  is  based  on
analytical reason declares that since even prescribed Vedic activities  have
an aroma of desire for rewards attached to them and the resultant  reactions
keep one enslaved in <i>samsara</i> the perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death  in
material existence. So even  prescribed  Vedic  activities  are  fit  to  be
abandoned by those aspirants striving for <i>moksa</i> or liberation from  material
existence.  But  those  of  the   <i>Mimamsaka</i>   philosophy   who   adhere   to
rationalistic  thinking  in  interpreting  the  conclusions  of  the   Vedic
scriptures maintain that prescribed Vedic duties are  not  to  be  abandoned
only the desires for rewards from such duties are in fact to be renounced.
