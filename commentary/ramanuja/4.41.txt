Lord Krishna explains that the performance of karma yoga or prescribed
Vedic activities is the mode of action in the ways He indicated above.
Dedication and renunciation means that actions are performed in jnana yoga
or the cultivation of Vedic knowledge. When performed in this way the
binding power of actions becomes neutralised. Also by this method any
doubts concerning the atma or soul are dispelled by knowledge of the atma.
The compound word atma-vantam means one who is self-satisfied. One whose
mind is unassailable and unapproachable by any type of doubt. Such a person
has achieved an unshakeable certitude about the reality and eternality of
the soul from the teachings received from the spiritual master. No actions
performed for oneself or for others in the present or the future can ever
bind such a person.
