Lord Krishna is stating that one must realizes that  all  the  diversity  of
forms throughout creation is manifested by the medium  of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the
material  substratum  pervading  physical  existence  which  gives  rise  to
unlimited bodies and their correlating senses. All <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings
whether demigods, humans or animals are constituted of the dual  natures  of
<i>purusa</i> the supreme spirit and <i>prakriti.</i> The compound word <i>eka-stham</i>  meaning
situated in one refers to the singularity of <i>prakriti</i> which  the  <i>ksetra</i>  or
sphere of activity  exists  within.  The  word  <i>vistaram</i>  meaning  expansion
refers to the variegated myriads of differentiated existences in  successive
form manifestations such as  children,  grandchildren,  great  grandchildren
all uniquely emanating  from  the  same  principle  of  <i>prakriti.</i>  Whosoever
understands that all external appearing differences  have  their  origin  in
<i>prakriti</i> and not in <i>purusa</i> or the supreme spirit nor <i>paramatma</i>  the  supreme
soul; such a person attains the realization  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence.
