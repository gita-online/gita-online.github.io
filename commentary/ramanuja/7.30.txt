Here the words ye viduh meaning those who know repeats the plural pronoun
ye in order to show that it does not apply to the votaries previously
mentioned by ye in verse 29 because  they are different. In this verse ye
has an independent sense in as much as it is indicative of another class of
aspirants.
<p>
The aisvarya-arthi or those seeking fortune who know the Supreme Lord
Krishna as identified with adhibhuta or all embodied beings as well as
knowing Him the presiding diety of all adhidauiva or the 330 million
demigods are requisite and verse 29 has no allusion.
<p>
The knowledge of Lord Krishna as identified with adhi-yagna or propitiation
in worship is knowledge which all three classes of aspirants have to
acquire in general; because after Vedic initiation it is natural and
obvious that the obligation to perform daily devotional duties as well as
occasional special devotional duties falls upon all three classes equally.
All three classes must also be able to remember Lord Krishna at the time of
death. The quality of their remembrance being firmly fixed in their mind in
accordance with the ideal which each class of aspirant considers to be the
goal of their desires.
<p>
That the class of aspirants who strive for liberation from old age and
death referred to in verse 29 also are included in striving to remember
Lord Krishna at the time of death is indicated by the conjunctive particle
ca meaning and, which denotes all of them. The conclusion to be accepted
from the mood and meaning of verses 29 and 30 is that it is a requisite
that the jnani who is mature in spiritual wisdom will have his own
cherished goal compatible with the goal of attaining the Supreme Lord
Krishna and to know Him to be the presiding deity identified with adhi-
yagna or the ultimate goal of all worship and propitiation. Then it is
natural that one who constantly meditated upon Him in life will certainly
have divine remembrance of Him at the time of death.
