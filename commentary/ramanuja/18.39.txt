The word <i>svabhava</i> means one's inherent nature. This inherent nature  arises
from <i>samskaras</i> or past impressions and <i>karma</i> or reactions from past actions
and is the root cause of determining birth as a Brahmin. The three <i>gunas</i> or
modes of material nature arising from <i>prakriti</i> or the  material  substratum
pervading all existence are determined by <i>karma</i> and <i>samskaras</i> as well.  The
predominating attribute of the Brahmins or spiritual class is  <i>sattva  guna</i>
the mode of goodness. The predominating characteristic of the  <i>ksatriya</i>  or
administrative class is <i>raja guna</i> the mode of  passion.  The  predominating
characteristic of the <i>vaisyas</i> or mercantile class is <i>tama guna</i>  mixed  with
<i>raja guna</i> and the predominating characteristic of the <i>sudras</i> is  only  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna.</i> Duties and responsibilities vary according to position and status  in
society as assigned by the Vedic scriptures. It  is  the  Vedic  scriptures
which defines what qualities are possessed by Brahmins  and  what  are  the
duties proper to their status as well as what occupations they  may  engage
in. This Vedic directive applies to the other orders in society as well.
