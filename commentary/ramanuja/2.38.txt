<i>Bhagavad-Gita: c</i><i>hapter 2, verse 39</i>
<p>
The use of the word <i>sankhya</i> determines the proper  understanding.  <i>Sankhyam</i>
is of  the  eternal  soul  category  which  is  apprehensible  through  the
understanding by the rational faculty of the mind. The immortal soul as  an
eternal principle must  be  understood.  That  understanding  by  which  to
comprehend it has already been given to Arjuna so he would know it  in  the
previous verses in this chapter being verse 12 <i>never at all was that I</i>  and
verse 30 <i>therefore thou has no cause to grieve for any creature.</i> As for the
use of the word <i>yoga</i> meaning  <i>karma  yoga</i>  which  is  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with   the    Ultimate
Consciousness through actions without desiring fruitive results. It  is  to
be understood that the spiritual intelligence acquired  by  following  this
<i>yoga</i> of actions when based on <i>sankhyam</i> or knowledge of the soul is the path
which leads to salvation. This precise understanding is  what  is  declared
further in this chapter in verse 49; but in the next verse learn just  what
spiritual knowledge is to be gained by this <i>karma yoga.</i> Imbibing the wisdom
from it, cut asunder the bonds of karmic reactions from  all  actions.  The
virtue of actions performed in this way will subsequently be given in verse
40.
