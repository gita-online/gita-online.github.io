So it should understood that <i>kama</i> or lust  is  able  to  dominate  even  the
intellect and thus is antagonistic to  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  or  the  cultivation  of
Vedic spiritual knowledge. So  one  must  with  firm  resolve  restrain  the
senses right from  the  very  beginning  and  keeping  the  mind  resolutely
established in the <i>atma</i> or soul, destroy this powerful enemy known  as  <i>kama</i>
eradicating it at the very root.
