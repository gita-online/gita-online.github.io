Lord Krishna concludes this chapter by emphasizing that even  if  prescribed
Vedic activities are performed meticulously according to the ordinances  and
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures;  if  they  are  devoid  of  <i>sraddha</i>  or
resolute faith they have absolutely no value and  are  known  as  <i>a-sat</i>  the
antithesis of SAT or perpetual goodness. Without the prerequisite  faith  in
the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  in  the  absolute  authority  of   the   Vedic
scriptures,  in  the  Vaisnava  spiritual  preceptor;  the  performance   of
prescribed Vedic activities bestow no rewards in this life or in  subsequent
reincarnations. For all time and energy, all efforts are wasted for  nothing
is obtained in the present life and nothing is attained  in  a  future  life
for the practitioner  of  prescribed  Vedic  activities  who  is  devoid  of
<i>sraddha.</i>  So  the  indispensable  value  of   resolute   faith   cannot   be
overestimated.
