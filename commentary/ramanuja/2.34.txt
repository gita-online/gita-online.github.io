Not only will happiness and fame elude him if he disregards his  duty  as  a
<i>ksatriya</i> but the world  opinion  of  those  competent  to  judge  and  those
incompetent as well will chastise him and  speak  of  his  act  of  disgrace
public and privately. They will say Arjuna was a coward for when the  battle
was about to begin he gave only  excuses  and  retreated  hastily  from  the
battlefield. The Supreme Lord Krishna is telling him  that  forever  history
will brand him for cowardice. If Arjuna was to reply that  what  the  public
think is of no consequence to him, the  Supreme  Lord  neutralises  that  by
stating that for a person of honour possessing  the  qualities  of  heroism,
determination, puissance, courage etc. which are all contrary  to  cowardice
to have to accept infamy is worse than death. If he was to acquire  disgrace
of this kind death for him would certainly  be  much  better.  If  reasoning
further one was to present the question of how ignominy could attach  itself
to one who is already a renowned hero and whose resignation from the  battle
field is prompted only by motives of respect for elders  and  compassion  to
friends and relatives then the next verse 34 neutralises that argument.
