The eternal soul embodied within the physical body regardless whether it  is
a human earthly body or the physical bodies possessed  by  the  demigods  in
the heavenly spheres; the  immortal  soul  is  eternally  invulnerable  even
though the body perishes. Hence understanding this principle as  fundamental
whatever diversity and varieagatedness in the forms of bodies born from  the
womb of a female who was also conceived in the womb of a female that  exists
from the demigods down through the human species as well as  to  the  animal
species and  the fish species and even including the  immovable  plants  and
trees it should be clearly understood  that  equanimity  prevails  regarding
the essential nature of the  immortal  soul  abiding  therein  whatever  the
bodily form and is eternal. Whereas  the  physical  body  is  transient.  So
Arjuna  is  being  instructed  that  factually  according  to  this   proper
understanding regarding all living entities, he has no basis to  lament  for
any being.
