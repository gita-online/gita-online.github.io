Lord Krishna concludes this chapter by  revealing  that  those  who  by  the
vision of knowledge realise the distinction existing between the  <i>ksetra</i>  or
sphere of activity which is the physical body and the  <i>ksetrajna</i>  or  knower
of the sphere of activity which for the omnipresent  <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme
Soul includes each and every the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul and in  the  case  of
the <i>atma</i> is the physical body. Along with those who imbibe and  realise  the
20 virtues given in verses 8 to 12 of this chapter beginning with  <i>amanitvam</i>
or humility, reverence which are the way and means of effecting escape  from
the degradation of mandated corporeal existence in <i>samsara</i> or the  perpetual
cycle of birth and death. Such persons realising their <i>atma</i>  achieve  <i>moksam</i>
or  liberation  from  material  existence  and  attain  <i>param</i>  the   supreme
transcendence.
