What Lord Krishna is confirming is that legions of  human  beings  over  the
ages have attained true realisation of His <i>avatar</i> forms or incarnations  and
His <i>lilas</i> or divine pastimes through <i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of  Vedic
knowledge and purifying themselves attained <i>moksa</i> or liberation and  entered
the abode of the Supreme Lord. The  spiritually  advanced  in  Vedic  wisdom
know  something  of  the  truth  about  the  Supreme  Lord  appearances  and
pastimes. But it is only the Vaisnava devotees  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  who
desire Him alone and who serve Him with love and  devotion,  only  they  can
truly  comprehend  the  sublime  transcendental  mystery   of   His   divine
appearances, pastimes, forms, abode and nature.
