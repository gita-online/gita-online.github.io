Lord Krishna in a chastising mood  reinforces  the  theme  that  if  out  of
<i>ahankara</i> or egoism the delusion of ignoring His instructions is  entertained
and assumption of independence is embraced and one decides  to  artificially
oppose their own natural path disregarding  His  mandate  to  the  contrary.
Such independent resolve will end in disappointment due to the reality  that
the predominant <i>guna</i> or mode of material nature will compel one  to  act  in
spite of all resistance. The mode itself will  coerce  one  to  acquiescence
beyond their control.
