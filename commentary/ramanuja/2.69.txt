The ocean is full unto itself  and  always  maintains  the  same  form  even
though countless rivers enter into it. Whether the rivers enter  or  do  not
enter, the ocean is unaffected and undergoes no difference.  Similarly  when
the senses of one in transcendent meditation  come  in  contact  with  sense
objects such as sound and it enters into the sense vector of hearing and  is
apprehended by the ears such a one still remains peaceful and  maintains  an
equipoise state of consciousness.  In other words the  sublime  satisfaction
derived from direct  soul  cognition  precludes  any  disturbance  from  the
senses or agitation  towards  sense  delights.  Whether  sense  objects  are
experienced by the senses or not experienced by  them  one  in  transcendent
meditation will not be affected and will not be subject to any  disturbance.
But Lord Krishna is saying that this state can never be attained by one  who
is <i>kamakana</i> full of lascivious desires or is controlled  by  the  same,  for
such a being can never achieve peace.
