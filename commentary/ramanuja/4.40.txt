The word ajnah means fool or one who is uninstructed in Vedic wisdom. The
word asraddadhahanah means one who has no faith even after being
instructed. The skeptic is one who doubts the knowledge one has already
received. One of this disposition perishes for one who doubts the veracity
of the atma or soul and the validity of the teaching taught by the
spiritual master has no hope in this world or in the heavenly spheres. That
is because sacrificing the three goals of human existence being dharma or
righteousness, artha or wealth and kama or pleasure. What chance will one
have for the fourth being moksa or liberation? For all the ambitions of
humans are accomplished by performing some prescribed duty in the Vedic
scriptures and fulfilment of any desire is dependent on the conviction that
the atma or soul is eternal and the atma is distinct from the physical
body. Whoever doubts the existence of the atma or soul or is not sure that
it is eternal cannot receive even the smallest percentage of spiritual
bliss.
