Actions are of two types. One is worldly activities undertaken  to  maintain
and progress the material existence of the physical body such  as  obtaining
food  and  shelter  and  material  development.  The  other   is   spiritual
activities enjoined by the injunctions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  such  as
propitiation to the Supreme Lord, absence of violence to any  living  being,
charity, etc. in short every act without an ulterior motive  and  without  a
hopeful gain. Whosoever being spiritual minded  without  any  motive  except
for satisfying the Supreme Lord Krishna and without any  desire  of  seeking
anything in return from Him, who offer all their activities as  devotion  to
Him, keeping Him alone as their sole goal and in one-pointed devotion  focus
their meditation on Him fully while worshipping Him in all their  activities
such as chanting His holy names, glorifying Him, offering  prayers  to  Him,
prostrating before His  deity  form,  hearing  about  His  <i>lilas</i>  or  divine
pastimes, enlightening others about His glories, etc. as the be all and  end
all of all existence itself. To such devotees as these  who  always  are  in
communion  with  Lord  Krishna  in  their  hearts  and  minds,  He   Himself
personally becomes their saviour by being  their  <i>samuddharta</i>  or  deliverer
from <i>mrtyu-samsara-sagarat</i> or the deadly ocean of  the  perpetual  cycle  of
birth and death which is the principle barrier which  stops  the  <i>atma's</i>  or
eternal souls of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied from attaining Him when  the  end  of
each physical life has transpired.
