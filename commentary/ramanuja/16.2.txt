Now Lord Krishna discloses the six  properties  predominating  the  demoniac
nature.
<p>
<p>
<i>dambah</i> is ostentation or a charade of pretentious  actions  perverting
religion.
<p>
<p>
<i>darpa</i> is pride or the unnatural  proclivity  for  excess  experiencing
sense objects.
<p>
<p>
<i>abhimanah</i> is arrogance or egotism concerning ones  self  interest  and
importance
<p>
<p>
<i>krodah</i> is anger which arises  when  greed  and  lust  is  impeded  and
frustrated.
<p>
<p>
<i>parusyam</i> is belligerence  or  spurious  indignation  towards  what  is
righteous.
<p>
<p>
<i>ajananam</i> is ignorance and lack of discrimination of  the  eternal  and
the temporal.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Those born in the demoniac nature act contrary to all that is righteous  and
fiendishly oppose the ordinances and injunctions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures
beneficial for all creation.
