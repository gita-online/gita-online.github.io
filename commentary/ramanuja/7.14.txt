Those evolved beings who by chance or determination surrender themselves  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna exclusively as their sole refuge and protector,  He
who is the most merciful. He who is the most  magnanimous,  He  who  is  the
only one to be depended on, He who is the  shelter  of  all  creation;  only
those so fully surrendered will be able to navigate the  tempestuous  oceans
of <i>maya</i> or illusory impressions  superimposed  upon  the  mind.  In  concise
language such surrendered souls  circumvent  <i>maya</i>  by  exclusively  devoting
themselves to the Supreme Lord Krishna.
