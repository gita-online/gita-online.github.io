<i>Bhagavad-Gita: c</i><i>hapter 2, verse 10</i>
<p>
Observing Arjuna overwhelmed with  grief  at  not  properly  perceiving  the
actual  distinction  between  the  physical  body  and  the  soul  and   yet
discoursing in the way that one with proper knowledge of the soul   existing
independent of the body would expound; seeing  him  in  the  predicament  of
having conflicting views, beholding him  languishing  with  inactivity  when
both the opposing armies were ready for  battle;  Lord  Krishna    smilingly
began to instruct him in the very next verse beginning  <i>na  tv  evaham  jatu</i>
<i>nasam</i> meaning never was there a time I did not exist, all  the  way  through
