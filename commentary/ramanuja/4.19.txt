The person performing <i>karma</i> or actions accrues reactions  by  attachment  to
desires and hankering for rewards. This is delusion as desires are  imagined
and fantasised before enactment. Thus it is merely a  false  idea  or  wrong
notion of the mind.   The  fantasising  alluded  to  here  consists  of  the
mentality which erroneously identifies the <i>atma</i> or  soul  with  <i>prakriti</i>  or
material nature along with the three <i>gunas</i>  being  the  modes  of  goodness,
passion and ignorance and mistakenly conceives of  them  as  all  being  one
principle.  But to that person seeking <i>moksa</i> or liberation all acts  regular
and occasional performed by them and necessitated by bodily maintenance  are
not subject to reactions  being  devoid  of  desire.  Further  exemption  is
guaranteed  as  the  aspirant  for  <i>moksa</i>  is  not  living  in  a  world  of
imagination or fantasy because such a person  performs  every  action  while
being cognisant of the eternal <i>atma.</i> Whoever performs <i>karma</i> in  this  manner
while meditating on the <i>atma</i> is one of spiritual  intelligence  situated  in
<i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation and  all  reactions  to  a  myriad  of  past
actions have been eradicated by the fire of knowledge. Thus Lord Krishna  is
praising the person who performs prescribed Vedic activities in <i>atma  tattva</i>
as being highly laudable. This is in sharp contrast to the <i>karmi</i> or one  who
performs actions for fruitive rewards being forced to accept reactions.
