But those whose self acquired merits have led them to approach  the  Supreme
Lord as their sole sanctuary whose chains of sins have  been  dissolved  and
destroyed and who are born of the divine nature are  the  <i>mahatmanas</i>  or  of
noble souls. The <i>mahatmanas</i> know Lord Krishna as the infinite source of  all
beings and cause  of  all  creation  whose  <i>lilas</i>  or  divine  pastimes  are
transcendental  material  existence  and  beyond  the   scope   of   mundane
comprehension. The Supreme Lord Krishna incarnates His <i>avatars</i>  or  immortal
incarnations out of His causeless compassion for  all  creation  to  protect
the righteous. Knowing the Supreme Lord as such the great souls  with  minds
exclusively devoted worship and adore Him  inceesantly.  Exclusive  devotion
of the mind denotes that  exultant  state  of  consciousness  where  one  is
imbued with ecstatic waves of love for the Supreme  Lord  where  if  without
such a mood and feeling of worshipful devotion not only in the mind  and  by
the external senses but from  the  <i>atma</i>  as  well  then  life  would  become
without support and untenable. Such great souls  worship  the  Supreme  Lord
with such intense one pointed focus  that  this  worship  alone  constitutes
their sole aim and complete goal.
