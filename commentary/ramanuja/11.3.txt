Lord Krishna is addressed as <i>paramesvara</i>  or  the  Supreme  Sovereign  Lord.
Although Arjuna has  fully  accepted  all  that  has  been  stated  by  Lord
Krishna; he still desires that the Supreme Lord Krishna being the  abode  of
all glorious attributes, out of compassion for His lieges and devotees  show
His resplendent, unparalleled <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form  expressive
of His divine, transcendental powers such as ruling,  protecting,  creating,
maintaining, sustaining and destroying. Only the Supreme Lord  Krishna,  the
ultimate reality of all realities, who is  sublimely unique from  everything
else in existence is able to reveal this form.
