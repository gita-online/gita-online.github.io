Furthermore Lord Krishna confirms  that  one  with  faith  in  Him,  without
malice and  envy, who even hears verses from Srimad Bhagavad-Gita  from  His
devotee is sufficient to  free  one  from  the  sins  obstructing  one  from
beginning <i>bhakti</i> exclusive loving devotion unto the Supreme  Lord  by  which
one will  become  a  <i>muktah</i>  liberated  being.  Just  to  hear  this  divine
discourse from the Supreme Lords devotee  is  enough  to  be  released  from
<i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death.  Such  a  blessed  one  will
join the ranks of the Supreme Lords devoted servitors abiding  eternally  in
the imperishable spiritual realms.
