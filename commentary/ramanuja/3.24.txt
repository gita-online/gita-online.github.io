If Lord Krishna of infallible will, the Supreme Lord of all,  and  in  whose
control the entire phenomenal display of  the  total  material  creation  is
created, maintained and preserved by His inconceivable potency; if  He  were
not to conduct Himself  seriously  and  omit  to  perform  prescribed  Vedic
activities for the benefit  of  all  the  worlds  then  others  seeing  Lord
Krishna's   indifference  would  also   conduct   themselves   indifferently
following His example.
<p>
When Lord Krishna took birth, seemingly as a human being, as the son of  the
great righteous King Vasudeva, he conducted Himself in all ways and  manners
as appropriate for his  position  in  society  as  a  prince  of  the  royal
<i>ksatriya</i> or warrior class. If  Lord  Krishna  acted  otherwise  all  mankind
would begin to imitate Him thinking that such  actions  were  virtuous,  the
worthy actions, of a worthy son from a worthy  father,  the  righteous  King
Vasudeva. In this way Lord Krishna  is  explaining  that  if  He  failed  to
perform Vedic activities mankind following His example would  be  led  in  a
negative way into a hellish perdition unable to purify themselves enough  so
they  could  achieve  <i>atma-tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation.  This   would   be
considered as a very serious offence and Lord Krishna would be at fault.  By
not setting the example of what  is  righteous  and  by  not  following  the
traditions and customs established by performing the  activities  prescribed
in the Vedic scriptures then all humanity would deviate  from  righteousness
and become totally lost. If Lord Krishna failed to respect  the  injunctions
and prohibitions of the Vedic scriptures then all the world would take  that
to be the standard of righteousness and the final verdict. There would  soon
ensue the mixing of classes and a mixture of moral and immoral standards  in
the class of pure and righteous people, leading to the complete  degradation
of society.  Lord Krishna is  stating  that  if  He  failed  to  follow  and
perform the Vedic injunctions then it would be the cause of the  destruction
of society. This is the purport. Also if Arjuna who  was  world  famous  for
never having been defeated in  battle  and  who  was  the  brother  of  King
Yudhisthira famed for his righteousness; if  Arjuna  refused  to  fight  and
protect <i>dharma</i> or righteousness then many other worthy and noble  <i>ksatriya's</i>
who were protectors of <i>dharma</i> might folow  his  example  and  also  renounce
their prescribed duties and refuse to protect righteousness then this  would
bring destruction to the world balance and ruination to the welfare  of  the
people. Thus it can  be  understood  that  for  specially  qualified  people
prescribed Vedic activities must be performed for the benefit of the  entire
human race and the welfare of the world.
