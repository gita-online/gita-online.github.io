Those who  through  the  power  of  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  individual  consciousness
attaining  communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness   understand   that
Brahma's'day lasts for 1000 <i>Maha Yugas.</i> Each of which is one  cycle  of  the
four <i>yugas</i> or ages combined which are <i>Satya  Yuga</i>  lasting  1,728,000  Earth
years, <i>Treta Yuga</i> lasting 1,296,000  years,  <i>Dvarapa  Yuga</i>  lasting  864,000
years and <i>Kali Yuga</i> lasting 432,000 years all together  totalling  4,320,000
years. When multiplied by 1000 Brahma's day equals  4  billion  320  million
years. The same total applies also for Brahma's night. So combined  one  day
and one night of Brahma equals 8 billion  640  million  years  and  this  is
known as a <i>kalpa.</i> One year of Brahma equals 360 of  these  <i>kalpas</i>  totalling
26 trillion, 438 billion and 400 million. Brahma  lives  for  100  of  these
years.
