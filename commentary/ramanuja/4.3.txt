Lord Krishna is suggesting that it should not be presumed that the  <i>yoga</i>  or
knowledge of the individual consciousness in  communion  with  the  Ultimate
Consciousness being given by him is just a  persuasive  speech  intended  to
prompt one to do their duty; for He now reveals that He also  instructed  it
to Visvavan the demi-god controlling the sun, as a way  of  attaining  <i>moksa</i>
or liberation from the cycle of birth and death. A method intended  for  the
salvation of all the universes and a measure  designed  to  benefit  all  of
creation, truly being the sublime goal of  humans.  Visvavan  taught  it  to
Manu who instructed it to Ikshavaku and so  on  successively  until  it  was
transmitted to  the  saintly  kings  from  the  mouths  of  their  spiritual
masters. But due to the passage of time and dull understanding  of  humanity
this knowledge was lost and forgotten. But the  very  same  <i>yoga,</i>  pure  and
pristine is being revealed in all its entirety and details by  Lord  Krishna
because Arjuna has taken full shelter in Him in loving devotion as the  only
refuge. No one other then the Supreme Lord Krishna  is  able  to  originally
explain the Bhagavad-Gita as it is the essence of the sublime wisdom of  all
the Vedas and encapsulates the mysteries of Vedanta.
