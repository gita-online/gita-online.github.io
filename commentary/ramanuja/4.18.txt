Action is <i>karma</i> and inaction is <i>akarma.</i> Actions concerning the <i>atma</i> or  soul
which is the essential subject to  be  known  in  human  existence  is  also
considered <i>akarma.</i> How this is to be understood Lord Krishna  is  explaining
here. There are two categories to be considered.
1) The person who performs actions   while  continuously  contemplating  the
<i>atma</i> 
2) The person who immersed within the <i>atma</i> perceives the <i>atma</i>  performs  all
actions
One who by contemplating the true nature of the <i>atma</i>  while  performing  all
activities is in the  first category. One who conceives the  nature  of  all
activities as actually the doings of the <i>atma</i> is in the second category.  By
actually performing prescribed Vedic activities with one's body and  at  the
same time meditating upon it within one's mind, the objective  as  well  the
subjective realisations are achieved and the true  nature  of  the  <i>atma</i>  is
perceived. Whoever sees that <i>karma</i> is  within  <i>akarma</i>  in  regards  to  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or knowledge o the soul. Such a person is considered to  be  situated
in wisdom and conversant with the ultimate purport of the Vedic  scriptures.
Such a spiritually intelligent person has realised the essence of all  Vedic
teachings  and  has  qualified  themselves  for  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material existence.
