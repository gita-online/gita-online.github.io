The words <i>bahu-damstra-karalam</i> mean innumerable  terrible  teeth  which  was
terrifying in appearance. The word <i>lokah</i>  or  worlds  refers  to  the  three
types of beings inhabiting these worlds. Those  who  are  benevolent,  those
who are inimical and those who are neutral. Almost all  of  them  just  like
Arjuna were trembling in fright at the ferocity of Lord Krishna's  <i>visvarupa</i>
or divine universal form.
