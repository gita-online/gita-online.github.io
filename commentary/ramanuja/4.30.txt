Commencing with <i>artha-yagnas</i>  or  offering  of  donations  for  worship  and
propitiation of the Supreme Lord up to the  <i>yagna</i>  of  <i>pranayama</i>  or  breath
control, different varieties of <i>karma yoga</i> or  prescribed  Vedic  activities
are given that  are  engaged  in  by  persons  according  to  qualification.
Clearly comprehending the purport of chapter 3, verse  10  that  all  beings
are blessed and benefited  by  <i>yagna;</i>  these  practitioners  have  dedicated
their lives to the performance of <i>yagna</i> and yet  they  do  not  neglect  the
regular daily duties as well as the occasional duties as prescribed  in  the
Vedic injunctions. Thus they have  acted  for  their  ultimate  welfare  and
destroyed all of their  sinful  reactions  from  past  actions.  Maintaining
their existence  by  partaking  exclusively  only  of  the  sanctified  food
offered in <i>yagna</i> these practitioners of <i>karma yoga</i>  eventually  realise  the
<i>atma</i> or soul within their etheric heart and perceive the eternal <i>Brahman</i>  or
the spiritual substratum pervading all existence which leads to the  Supreme
Lord.
