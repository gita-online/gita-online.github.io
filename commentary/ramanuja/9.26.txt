Whoever offers the Supreme Lord Krishna  even  the  most  easily  obtainable
articles such as a flower, a fruit, some water  or  even  a  leaf,  He  will
accept if the are offered with <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving  devotion.  Lord
Krishna's devotee love Him so ardently  and  enthusiastically  that  without
dedicating all they have for His acceptance  the  devotee  finds  themselves
unable to tolerate their very existence and subsequently so  impassioned  do
they feel this love that their very act of offering in devotion even a  leaf
has great merit in  the  fulfillment  of  their  enthusiasm  to  please  the
Supreme Lord. The compound word <i>prayatmatmanah</i> means a devoted, pure  minded
and pure hearted being. Pure in mind, pure in heart consists of an  attitude
and mentality of dedicating  everything  they  offer  to  the  Supreme  Lord
exclusively with only motives  of  pure  devotion  and  love  which  is  the
topmost ambition and goal of the spiritually enlightened. Thus  such  humble
offerings as water or even a  simple  leaf  are  given  with  love  by  such
persons.

The Supreme Lord Krishna, the Resplendent Lord of all Lords, Whose  will  is
unalterable. Who is completely self-satisfied. Whose glorious qualities  and
attributes are transcendent and limitless. Who is the  sole  source  of  all
created beings and from Whom  all  the  trillions  of  universes  come  into
existence, He views their appearance  and  disappearance  like  a  marvelous
show that is like sport for Him. Although  He  is  supremely  and  sublimely
satisfied naturally in  the  unlimited  bliss  of  Himself  in  unparalleled
felicity; He is always joyful to receive an offering from  His  devotees  no
matter how simple. The Supreme Lord accepts even the  most  humble  offering
from His devotee even if it is only  fresh  water  or  a  flower  which  are
easily available because it is given with <i>bhakti</i>  or  loving  devotion.  The
Moksa Dharma states: The Supreme Lord looks at such offerings  as  being  so
rare and precious that they are comparable to the most cherished  possession
of  desired expectations in a longing heart.  In  Mahabharata,  Santi-parva,
chapter CLXXI, verse LXIII it states: Whatever acts are consecrated  to  the
Supreme Lord with  exclusive  single  focused  devotion,  the  Supreme  Lord
Himself accepts them upon His  head.  Inasmuch  as  these  are  the  special
characteristics of the exalted, noble souled <i>bhaktas</i> or loving  devotees  of
the  Supreme  Lord.  Everyone  regardless   of   position   should   without
consideration of thinking or acting become such a <i>bhakta</i> and along with  all
family members attain loving devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord  as  has  been
profusely described. Such a  one  should  always  be  singing  His  glories,
chanting His praises, remembering His pastimes, rendering  service  to  Him,
worshipping Him, prostrating before Him and offering everything to Him.  All
these things should be lovingly  performed  along  with  one's  secular  and
religious duties according to one's <i>varna</i> and <i>asrama</i> or class  and  position
in society as authorized by Vedic scriptures.
