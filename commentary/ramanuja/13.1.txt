The first division of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita known as the <i>Karma  Yoga</i>  section
comprises  the  first  six  chapters  describing  two  paths:  the  path  of
spiritual actions and the path of spiritual knowledge by which  an  aspirant
may achieve <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the  eternal  soul.  It  has  also
been explained  that  the  achievement  of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  is  essential  for
attaining <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence.
<p>
The middle division  of  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  known  as  the  <i>Bhakti  Yoga</i>
section comprises the second six  chapters  which  reveals  that  <i>bhakti</i>  or
exclusive loving devotion which is preceded by factual  spiritual  knowledge
of the Supreme Lord Krishna as revealed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  is  the
paramount  attainment.  Such  spiritual  knowledge  about  Lord  Krishna  is
prerequisite and essential to <i>bhakti</i> and subsequent attainment of  communion
with the Supreme Lord and eternal association which  is  the  ultimate  goal
and most exalted destination. It  is  also  elucidated  herein  that  <i>bhakti</i>
constitutes the means  by  which  those  aspirants  ambitious  of  acquiring
opulence and those aspirants ambitious for <i>atma-tattva</i> or  soul  realisation
can both have their respective desires fulfilled as well.
<p>
Now in the final division of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita known as  the  <i>Jnana  Yoga</i>
section comprising the last six  chapters,  the  topics  propounded  in  the
first  12  chapters  will  be  further  illuminated  by  Lord  Krishna.  Two
categories will be examined: <i>prakriti</i> or the spiritual substratum  pervading
physical existence and <i>Purusa</i> or the Supreme  eternal  consciousness.  Their
combined union constitutes the  complete  cosmic  creation.  The  nature  of
<i>Isvara</i> or the Supreme Lord, the means of salvation, the paths  of  <i>karma</i>  or
spiritual activities for the Supreme Lord, <i>jnana</i> or spiritual  knowledge  of
the Supreme Lord and <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion to the Supreme Lord  will  be
further delineated along with instructions on how to  practice  and  perform
each path.
<p>
Beginning this <i>Jnana Yoga</i> section<i>,</i>  this  chapter  explains  the  nature  of
matter and the soul, the way to realise the  soul  as  distinctly  different
from matter, the reason why the <i>atma</i> is associated with matter and  the  way
the <i>atma</i> may be meditated upon.
<p>

Lord Krishna explains that while in a physical body  the  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied
being believes they are that body, thinking I am a man, I am  a  demigod,  I
am a female, I am famous, I am powerful, etc. all of  which  are  distinctly
different form the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul. The physical  body  is  that  which
the spiritually intelligent assert as the <i>ksetra</i> or field of enjoyment.  One
who has the realisation of  the  <i>jiva</i>  being  part  of  an  aggregate  whole
composed of divisible parts being the physical body,  the  subtle  body  and
the <i>atma.</i> One who has the understanding that I know this  body  and  instead
of the mentality that I am this body. One who is cognisant of  these  things
and realises  what  the  <i>atma</i>  actually  is  factually   asserted  as  being
<i>ksetrajna</i> or the knower of the field. It can be said that when cognition  of
objects external to the physical body arises  the  conception  of  I  am  my
human body who sees for example this house before me, implying that the  one
who sees thinks the <i>atma</i> is inseparable from the physical body and not  that
the  <i>atma</i>  is  totally  independent  of  the  physical  and  subtle  bodies.
Subsequently when one has achieved <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation  of  the  soul
and experienced its spiritual existence then one will be cognisant of  their
physical body merely as a house within which the <i>atma</i> inhabits. To  perceive
a house as external from the physical body is the  same  as  perceiving  the
<i>atma</i> as external from the physical body for one who is realised. One who  is
cognisant of this reality sees the <i>atma</i>  as a distinct entity separate  from
the physical and subtle bodies.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
To assert the indisputably modifiable and perishable physical body  and  its
qualitative characteristics to the immortal <i>atma</i> in accordance with the  law
of coexistence of subject and attribute  is  as  unreasonable  as  asserting
that the milk of cattle is an inseparable attribute of every  type  of  cow,
bull or heifer falling under that generic term.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Due to the fact that the phenomenally unique and sublime nature of the  <i>atma</i>
precludes any perceptibility by the senses of  sight,  sound,  taste,  touch
and smell to experience it and is only perceptible by the  consciousness  of
a clarified mind purified by introspection amd meditation derived  from  the
process of <i>yoga</i> or the science of the  individual  consciousness  perfecting
communion with the ultimate consciousness.  The  spiritually  deficient  are
beguiled and bewildered  by  the  mere  propensity  of  matter  and  deluded
misconstrue the perishable physical body and  the  eternal,  immortal  <i>atma.</i>
This will be further clarified in chapter 15, verses 10 and  11  where  Lord
Krishna explains that those bereft of wisdom  with  impure  thoughts  cannot
perceive the <i>atma.</i>
