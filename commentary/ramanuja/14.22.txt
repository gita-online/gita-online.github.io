The  word  <i>prakasa</i>  means  illumination,   lucidity,   the   brightness   of
disposition and are the effects of <i>sattva guna</i> or the mode of goodness.  The
word <i>pravritti</i> means enthusiastic effort or  the  disposition  to  endeavour
actively and are the effects of <i>raja guna</i> the  mode  of  passion.  The  word
<i>moha</i> means delusion, bewilderment or  having  a  distorted  perception.  All
things external to the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul are of two categories.  One  is
what  causes  attraction  and  the  second  is  what  causes  aversion.  The
fundamental symptom of discerning who is beyond the three <i>gunas</i> or modes  of
material nature is that such a being neither desire to accept  anything  nor
does such a one  desire  to  reject  anything.  Whatever  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna designates to come, such a one remains equipoise in all  situations.
Such a one is <i>udasinavat</i> or unconcerned with external circumstances  because
of being enraptured within by <i>atma tattva</i> or  realisation  of  the  immortal
soul. Therefore one is naturally indifferent to anything external.  One  who
is never agitated by attraction and aversion  which  arise  from  the  three
<i>gunas</i> and who lucid and tranquil reflects within that it is natural for  the
impulses of the three <i>gunas</i>  to  occasionally  parade  themselves  in  one's
consciousness, is never deluded by them into being impelled to  act  as  the
qualities might provoke one to respond.

The word <i>sama</i> means equanimity or keeping oneself equipoise in both joy  and
distress. The word  <i>svasthah</i>  means  solidly  situated,  established  firmly
within on the immortal <i>atma,</i> filled with raptureand bliss by its  communion.
Such a one is never even distracted by external things let alone  influenced
by them. Even when exposed to great events of joy or catastrophic events  of
grief such a one  is  undisturbes  and  does  not  succumb  to  delusion  or
illlusion. To such a one a clod of earth or , a precious jewel or  a  nugget
of gold all are looked upon alike as merely modifications  of  <i>prakriti.</i>  So
there is nothing in material existence which such  a  one  has  any  special
attraction or aversion towards.

The word means <i>dhirah</i> means sober and denotes  the  wisdom  of  one  who  is
knowledgeable  of  the  distinction  between  <i>prakriti</i>   or   the   material
substratum pervading physical existence and the  eternal  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal
soul. Hence such a one remains equaniminous in both praise and  censure.  It
is the deisre for  praise  and  adulation  that  shows  the  consequence  of
egotism which abides in the mind and is erroneously mistaken  for  the  <i>atma</i>
and deludes one into thinking that it  is  a  great  honor  to  be  praised.
Similarly aversion to being ridiculed and censured is also  the  consequence
of same egotism which makes one think it is ignoble and shameful to  receive
such infamy. But both conceptions are the results of delusion  and  one  who
is established in <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the immortal soul  is  never
implicated in illusion  as  such  a  being  is  unlimited  in  consciousness
knowing that all material designations  are  all  transcended  by  communion
with the <i>atma</i>. In the same way that egotism is alienated from the <i>atma</i>  what
pertains to egotism such as honor and disgrace, friends and enemies,  praise
and censue does not affect the <i>atma.</i> One who is illuminated by  <i>atma  tattva</i>
is unconcerned and indifferent to worldly matters. Similarly  since  such  a
one comprehends that all efforts of activity are the cause and  perpetuation
of physical embodiment such a one abandons all efforts not  related  to  the
<i>atma.</i> Such a person is known to be a conqueror of  the  theree  <i>gunas.</i>  Next
the primary means to overcome them will be given.
