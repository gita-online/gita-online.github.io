Those who are attracted to meditation and <i>upasate</i> or worship on the  <i>avyakta</i>
or  the  unmanifest,  impersonal  <i>brahman</i>  being  the  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence or are devoted to realising the imperishable  nature
of their <i>atma</i>  or  eternal  soul  which  is  indefinable  by  the  mind  and
imperceptible find that both ways are completely impossible to be  perceived
by any of the senses. The phrase <i>sarvatra-gam acintyam</i> means  all  pervading
and inconceivable, respectively.  The  understanding  is  that  despite  the
<i>atma</i> or eternal soul being present in the  etheric  heart  of  every  living
entity everywhere in creation in the demigods, the humans, the animals,  the
fish,  the  plants  etc.  It  is  completely  inconceivable  how  the  total
aggregate of all these trillions upon trillions of  souls  approaching  even
an infinite amount actually comprise the transcendental, spiritual  body  of
the Supreme Lord Krishna. Not only is it not possible to conceive  this,  it
is also  impossible to imagine what such an infinite  spiritual  form  would
appear like so it is completely indescribable. Even if  one  achieved  <i>atma-</i>
<i>tattva</i> or soul realisation and were able  to  perceive  the  form  of  their
individual <i>atma</i> it would not be of any  consequence  in  conceiving  by  any
stretch of the imagination such an infinite and phenomenal  spiritual  form.
The word <i>kutastham</i> means stable  or  uniform  denoting  that  essence  which
never changes in form regardless of the constant changing of bodies  of  all
living beings every life, thus it is <i>acalam</i>  or  immutable  because  of  its
singular unmoving nature and thus <i>dhruvam</i> or everlasting.  Along  with  this
must be  <i>sanniyamyendriya-gramam</i>  meaning  all  the  senses  must  be  fully
controlled  and  restrained  from  absorption  in  their  accustomed   sense
objects. The phrase <i>sarvatra sama-buddhayah</i>  means  equanimity  towards  all
living entities which manifests  itself  when  the  cognition  of  the  <i>atma</i>
residing in the etheric heart of all living  entities  being  of  variegated
and diverse species seen specifically as  consciousness  although  concealed
by various forms becomes a reality. Firmly fixed in this  understanding  one
automatically becomes <i>sarva-bhuta-hite ratah</i> or favourably disposed  to  the
welfare of all living entities or it can mean well removed from wishing  any
enmity towards  any  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being,  for  enmity  is  a  product
engendered by false ego due to imagining gradations in  the  <i>atma's</i>  between
<i>jivas</i> because of external differences in their physical bodies.
