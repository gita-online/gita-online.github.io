Lord Krishna explains that the mode of passion is known as <i>rajas</i> and is  the
cause of sexual desires known as carnal  lust.  From  <i>rajas</i>  arises  <i>trishna</i>
which is desire for all forms of sensual enjoyments through  the  medium  of
the senses such as seeing, hearing,  tasting,  smelling  and  feeling.  Also
arising from <i>rajas</i> is <i>sanga</i> or desire to be in the  association  of  family,
friends  and  loved  ones.  Thus  <i>rajas</i>  encourages  desires  and   promotes
activities to enjoy such desires which binds one to the reactions of  merits
or demerits and keeps the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being  incessantly  revolving  in
<i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of  birth  and  death.  This  propensity  for
constantly performing actions is inherent and also causes the <i>jiva</i>  to  take
birth at a specific place with a  particular  body  suitable  to  enjoy  the
rewards of previous actions. Hence by instigating the desire for  performing
works one is kept in bondage. In this way <i>rajas</i> is  known  to  be  the  root
cause of lust, sensual desires and attachment.
