Duryodhana while witnessing the strength of the Pandavas army  supported  by
the might of Bhima weighed his own armies  strength  under  the  command  of
Bhishma and perceiving the  mood  of  his  perceptor  Dronacarya,  he  could
understand the inadequacy in his own troops and the perfection  of  strength
on the Pandavas side to be victorious  and  internally  this  aggrieved  him
heavily. Bhishma seeing all this gave a roar like a lion and blew a  mighty,
reverberating blast on his conchshell which  was  followed  by  a  tumultous
beating of drums, blaring  of  horns  and  blasting  of  conchshells  as  if
indicative of the victory in order  to  cheer  up  Duryodhana.  Immeadiately
upon hearing this <i>Lord Krishna</i> and Arjuna seated in their  majestic  chariot
capable of conquering all the worlds;  both  seized  their  conchshells  and
reverberated  a  sound  that  shook  all  the  worlds.   Thereafter   Bhima,
Yudhisthira, Nakula and Sahadeva and the rest  of  the  maha-rathas  of  the
Pandava army blew their conchshells and the roar  which  was  heard  cleaved
the hearts of Duryodhana and the army of the Kauravas and  in  their  hearts
they felt that the battle was already lost.  Thus  did  Sanjaya  narrate  to
Dhritarashtra whose only concern was for the success of his  son  Duryodhana
and the Kauravas in the battle.
