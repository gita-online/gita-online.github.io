The actual nature  of  <i>karma</i>  or  prescribed  Vedic  actions  performed  for
attaining <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence should be  understood.
Actions which are <i>nitya</i> or regular  and  actions  which  are  <i>naimittika</i>  or
occasional if done with any sense of enjoyment in mind or if they  are  done
with the desire for material rewards should both be known to be  <i>vikarma</i>  or
improper actions.  The absence of action known  as  <i>akarma</i>  which  sometimes
can be considered action as well should also be comprehended. Therefore  the
path of <i>karma</i> is not easily discernible for one seeking  <i>moksa.</i>  The  reason
why regular and occasional activities should be clearly assimilated  for  an
aspirant for <i>moksa</i> is because the  rewards  for  each  are  varied  but  one
should look at them all with equipoise and realising that they all have  one
uniform purpose and that  is  the  fulfilment  of  the  goal  which  is  the
attainment of <i>moksa.</i> Without proper teaching and understanding of the  Vedic
scriptures one will not perceive this critical conclusion but  this  is  the
Vedic conception as revealed by Lord Krishna already  and  thus  it  is  not
necessary to expatiate upon the subject further here.
