Knowing Lord Krishna to be bequeather of all rewards for all actions. The
sovereign lord of all existence. The intimate friend within all beings and
wellwisher of all beings attains moksa or liberation from material
existence. What this means is that if karma yoga or the selfless practice
of prescribed Vedic activities and are the sum total of all duties are
performed consciously as offerings of worship to Lord Krishna then this in
itself  is enough to grant moksa. This is the easiest and most practical as
it is so simple to do. Moreover who would not be inclined to offer such
service to a dear friend especially when this friend is such a universal
benefactor existing within and without every living being throughout all of
creation.
