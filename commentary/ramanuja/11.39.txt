In regard to not knowing the extent of Lord Krishna's  glory,  His  infinite
power, His  immeasurable  prowess,  His  omnipresent  nature  as  being  all
pervasive, His greatness as the sole creator  of  all  creation;  Arjuna  is
apologising that he  might  have  through  heedlessness,  or  folly  due  to
familiarity might have put himself on equal status as the Supreme  Lord  and
out of affection and friendship might have addressed Him disrespectfully  by
calling Him simply as <i>He</i> Krishna or <i>He sakhe</i> O' friend or  <i>He  Yadava</i>  which
is the name of the family clan in which He appeared. Addressing the  Supreme
Lord such could be taken as  lacking  in  humility.  Also  on  occasions  of
jesting and merriment while sitting, eating  and  resting  together  if  any
impropriety or omission of proper respect was inadvertently  committed  then
for all these indiscretions  Lord  Krishna  is  being  humbly  beseeched  to
forgive.
