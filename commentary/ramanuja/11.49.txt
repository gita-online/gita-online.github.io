Lord Krishna explains His two-armed form is extremely difficult to behold
and is very rarely seen. The demigods in the heavenly planets having heard
about it are always hankering to see His visvarupa or divine universal form
but it is inaccessible to them and His two-armed form they have no
opportunity to witness as they are unaware of it.
