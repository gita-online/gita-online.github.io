Lord Krishna clarifies that <i>danam</i> or charity  that  is  bequeathed  with  an
inner  desire  and  expectation  for  reward  or  <i>danam</i>  that  is  proffered
reluctantly, or <i>danam</i> that is inferior due to damage or spoilage,  or  <i>danam</i>
that is undamaged and  perfectly  good  and  fresh  unspoiled  articles  are
stingily given grudgingly are all known to be  situated  in  <i>raja  guna</i>  the
mode of passion.
