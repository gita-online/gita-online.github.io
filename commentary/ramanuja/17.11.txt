Now in order to explain the three types of austerities incorporated  in  and
corresponding to the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature;  Lord  Krishna
describes their character first as that of bodily austerity, that of  verbal
austerity and that of mental austerity from each of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  from
where <i>tapas</i> manifests. Worship of the Supreme Lord Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations and expansions in their installed deity forms  after
being duly initiated in the prescribed mantras  by  the  Vaisnava  spiritual
master, worship of the Vaisnavas and  brahmanas,  worship  of  the  singular
<i>diksa guru</i> the initiating spiritual master and the elevated <i>siksa  gurus</i>  or
instructing spiritual masters. The word <i>saucam</i> means internal  and  external
cleanliness. <i>Arjjavam</i> means no duplicity, the intention of the mind and  the
action are not different. <i>Brahmacaryam</i> is celibacy the absence  of  thinking
about engaging in sexual relations.  <i>Ahimsa</i>  is  not  causing  harm  to  any
living entity by thought, word or  deed.  All  these  activities  constitute
austerity of the physical body in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
