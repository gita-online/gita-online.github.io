The word  <i>pravritti</i>  is  the  performance  of  proper  actions  which  means
engaging in Vedically  authorised  activities  as  <i>dharma</i>  or  righteousness
which leads to realms of spiritual beatitude and <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material existence.  <i>Nivrriti</i> is  refraining  from  engaging  in  activities
which lead to bondage.  The  demons  known  also  as  <i>asuras</i>  meaning  those
without spiritual illumination and lack of spiritual insight have  no  scope
for  fathoming  spiritual  principles.   <i>Saucam</i>   means   cleanliness   both
internally and externally. The demons are always polluted by their  depraved
thoughts and contaminated by their degraded actions and hence never clean.

<i>Acharya</i> means exemplary behaviour and excellent conduct such  as  performing
<i>japa</i> or  repetitively  chanting  Lord  Krishna's  holy  names  or  <i>sankirtan</i>
congregationally chanting
<i>Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare</i>
<i>Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare</i>
Also always observing <i>ekadasi</i> which is fasting from all grains and beans  on
the 11th day of the waxing and waning moons and  the  daily  performance  of
<i>sandhya vandana</i> which is <i>gayatri</i> mantras given by the spiritual master  that
are chanted silently at the three junctures  of  the  day:  dawn,  noon  and
dusk. The Daksa-smritti beginning <i>sandhya hinot suci nityam</i> states: One  who
omits the performance of <i>sandhya</i> is always impure, unholy and unfit for  any
spiritual duties. The word <i>satyam</i> means truth  and  denotes  that  which  is
spoken or written in total conformity with factual reality.  Such  qualities
as these have never been heard  of  or  seen  to  be  present  in  those  of
demoniac nature.
