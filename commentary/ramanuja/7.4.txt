It should be  known  that  <i>mula  prakriti</i>  or  the  primeval  substratum  of
material nature  is  the  basis  for  the  infinite  and  phenomena  of  all
creation. It ministers its all encompassing energy in material existence  to
all sentient  beings  in  a  marvellous  variety  of  ways.  As  objects  of
enjoyment, bodily organs to enjoy with as well as regions  of  enjoyment  to
interact with. All these things are also manifestations of the Supreme  Lord
Krishna's nature and they  are  divided  into  eight  principle  categories.
1)Solids  being  Earth  distinguished  by  odor,   2)liquids   being   water
distinguished by moisture, 3)light being fire distinguished by  heat,  4)air
being  gases  distinguished   by   lightness   and   5)space   being   ether
distinguished by unlimitedness, 6) <i>manas</i> or mind with its accompanying  five
senses and <i>ahankara</i> or false ego.
