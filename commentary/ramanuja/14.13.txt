Here Lord Krishna explains what is indicative of <i>tama guna</i> or  the  mode  of
ignorance.
The word <i>aprakasa</i> means devoid of illumination, nescience, ignorance.
The word <i>apravrrtih</i> means inertia, lethargy, absence of effort.
The  word  <i>pramada</i>  means  madness,  fragmentation,  propensity  for  sinful
activities.
The word <i>moha</i> means illusion, distortion, misinterpretation of reality.
When <i>tamas</i> is predominant then  delusion  and  perversion  are  seen  to  be
rampant in society.
