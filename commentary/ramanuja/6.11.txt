Lord Krishna begins with the words  <i>sucau  dese</i>  means  pure  or  sanctified
place. Purity is to be found in nature  due  to  its  being  unoccupied  and
unfrequented by unclean and contaminated persons.  The  word  <i>sthiram</i>  means
firm infers the <i>asana</i> or seat should not be overly soft  neither  should  it
be so high that one may fall from it nor too low as in a  hole.  One  should
by all means have a mat of <i>kusa grass</i> which is sacred in Vishnu  tattva  and
then should be covered by a  deerskin  which  deters  poisonous  pests  like
snakes and scorpions from approaching one while in concentrated  meditation.
On top should be placed a wool or  cotton  cloth.  Such  a  seat  should  be
aesthetic to look at and inviting. Sitting upon such a seat one  should  one
should  withdraw  the  senses  and  freeing  the  mind  from  all   external
distractions one should focus the mind exclusively upon  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul
within until upon its realisation one is freed from <i>samsara</i> or  the  endless
cycle of birth and death. By every means realise the <i>atma.</i>
