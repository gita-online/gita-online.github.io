One  even  more  advanced  in  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of   the   individual
consciousness attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness by  <i>dhyana</i>
or meditation realises the intrinsic uniqueness and sublime sameness of  all
<i>atma's</i> or souls  as  having  the  nature  of  omniscience  and  omnipresence
although residing in unlimited variegated physical and subtle bodies.  Fully
comprehending that the <i>atma</i> has no connection with material nature the  <i>yogi</i>
looks upon all dualities such as happiness and affliction like  one  is  the
same as the other and this applies whether circumstances befall unto such  a
<i>yogi</i> or befall unto others such as the happiness of an infant being born  or
the affliction of a parent dying. This means it is  one  and  the  same  for
such a <i>yogi</i> regarding their own offspring and parents  as  it  is  regarding
other peoples offspring and parents.  Such a <i>yogi</i> who is so far advanced  as
to regard both happiness  and  affliction  equally  with  the  same  sublime
indifference is qualified to be known as the best of <i>yogi's.</i>
