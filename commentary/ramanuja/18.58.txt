With all thy mind, with  all  thy  heart  and  with  all  thy  soul  swiftly
surrender unto the Supreme Lord Krishna taking full refuge in Him alone.  It
is He who is the Supreme controller, the Lord  of  all  lords,  the  Supreme
goal and ultimate attainment. Who out of His causeless mercy for  all  <i>jivas</i>
or embodied beings  and  the  incomparable  love  He  has  for  His  beloved
devotees so much so that He, the Supreme Lord of all  even  condescended  to
accept the position of chariot driver for  His  dear  devotee.  So  everyone
should  earnestly  seek  Him  as  their  sole   refuge   adhering   to   His
unsurpassable teachings manifested in the injunctions and ordinances of  the
Vedic scriptures and by following His  unequivocal  instructions  in  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita. By doing so one will by His Grace be able to  transcend  <i>maya</i>
the illusory energy, surpassing the ocean of <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle  of
birth and death and at last achieve the peace that passes all  understanding
attaining the Supreme  state  of  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord,  that
immortal state of  eternal  empyrean  from  which  there  is  no  return  to
material existence.
<p>
Throughout the Vedic scriptures these points are  confirmed.  The  Chandogya
Upanisad  III.XIII.VII  beginning  <i>atha  yad  atah  paro  divo</i>  states:  The
resplendent Supreme  Lord  shines  forth  effulgently  above  the  universe,
beyond  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all   existence,
transcending all worlds. The  Katha  Upanisad  I.III.IX  beginning  <i>vijnanas</i>
<i>arathiryastu</i> states: One can cross  the  ocean  of  <i>samsara</i>  and  reach  the
everlasting, eternal abode of the Supreme Lord, the  final  resort.  In  the
Taittriya Upanisad III.X.III beginning <i>yasah iti pashusu  jyotiriti</i>  states:
The Supreme Lord's divine splendour is apparent in every aspect of  creation
whether phenomenal or celestial such as  the  splendour  of  the  cows,  the
light of the stars, the bliss of the generative organ for procreation,  etc.
But when one meditates  upon  Lord  Krishna  as  the  supreme  worship  able
divinity then one obtains Him and the immortal state of eternal empyrean.
