Lord Krishna confirms that everyone who worships the  demigods  like  Brahma
or Shiva as prescribed in <i>traividya</i> or the <i>karma kanda</i>  or  fruitive  reward
sections of the Vedas; as well as  worship  of  lesser  divinities  such  as
Indra and Surya and also worship of impersonal conceptions of  god  are  all
in reality propitiation to the Supreme Lord but offered in  an  unconscious,
indirect way. For this reason as  stated  previously  all  the  330  million
demigods comprise the body of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  within  the
etheric heart of each He is residing as <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul  as  also
within all living entities. In every  sense  all  the  demigods  find  their
highest good and noblest purpose by supplication to Him.  The  ignorant  who
worship the demigods and other lesser gods are  totally  oblivious  to  this
eternal truth and are not performing worship of the demigods in  the  manner
prescribed in  the  Vedic  scriptures.  The  Taittiriya  Upanisad  III.II.II
beginning  <i>chatur  hotaro  yatra  sampadam  gacchanti  devaih</i>   states:   By
<i>paramatma</i> the four Vedic  rituals  known  as  <i>hotri</i>  are  fulfilled  by  the
demigods. The Supreme Lord in His localised aspect is  <i>paramatma</i>  who  makes
the ritual successful.  Thus  it  is  clear  that  the  benefits  gained  by
ceremonial worship to any of the demigods is only by grace  of  the  Supreme
Lord.

The four <i>hotri</i> rituals as prescribed in  the  <i>karma  kanda  section</i>  of  the
Vedas such as <i>Agnihotra</i> or propitiation to the sacred fire  by  offering  it
oblations of ghee and grains everyday. Two of the other <i>hotris</i> given in  the
Taittriya Upanisad I.VI.VIII beginning  <i>ya  evam  vidvan</i>  are  <i>Purnamasa</i>  or
penance for full moon and <i>Darsa</i> or penance for new moon.  The  followers  of
<i>traividya</i> cannot comprehend that all  the  rituals  and  worship  that  they
offer to the demigods is in reality indirect worship  to  the  Supreme  Lord
who has Brahma, Shiva, Indra, Surya and all  the  330  million  demigods  as
part of His transcendental body and that He is the actual  object  of  their
worship. Hence because they  worshipped  indirectly  they  are  entitled  to
indirect recompense because it descends from  the  Supreme  Lord  back  down
through the demigods who taking their  share  bestow  whatever  mundane  and
transitory desire the ritual was  performed  for  such  as  entry  into  the
heavenly planets and because such a boon is not eternal  when  the  allotted
time fo enjoyment has expired they will be recycled back  into  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death again as mortals.

It should be clearly understood that although the Vedic scriptures  directly
enjoin  worship  of  the  demigods  they  also  explain  that  the  demigods
constitute the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord and that  He  is  the
spirit soul within each and  every  one  of  them  as  well   and  thus  the
spiritually intelligent <i>mahatmanas</i> or great souls easily understand that  by
worshipping the Supreme Lord  all the demigods are automatically  worshipped
as well and thus with great love and devotion they exclusively  worship  the
Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  and  expansions
as revealed in Vedic scriptures.
