The phrase <i>sarva-dharmam parityajya</i> means  renouncing  all  conceptions  and
methods  of  religiosity  completely.  Whatever  is  authorised   in   Vedic
scriptures as righteous may be utilised in worship and propitiation  to  the
Supreme Lord by <i>karma yoga</i> or facilitating communion with the  Supreme  Lord
by prescribed Vedic actions, by <i>bhakti yoga</i> or facilitating  communion  with
the Supreme Lord by exclusive loving devotion or by <i>jnana yoga</i>  facilitating
communion with the Supreme  Lord  by  spiritual  knowledge.  But  all  other
methods and conceptions must be renounced and relinquished along with  <i>phala</i>
<i>tyaga</i> or expectation of rewards, <i>karma tyaga</i> or identifying oneself  as  the
owner of the result and <i>kartritva</i> or believing oneself to be the  author  of
the act. The phrase <i>mam ekam saranam vraja</i> means to take  exclusive  shelter
in the Supreme Lord Krishna understanding that He is the most  worthy,  most
desirable and most worshipable of all that exists. That this is the  quality
of renunciation warranted in the  Vedic  scriptures  that  is  required  was
evidenced by the Supreme Lord in the beginning of this chapter. In  verse  4
He stated: Hear the truth about renunciation which is threefold. In verse  9
He stated: Actions are  deemed as renunciation in sattva guna  the  mode  of
goodness when desire for rewards are abandoned. In verse 11 He  stated:  One
is known as renounced who renounces the rewards for  actions.  Lord  Krishna
is promising His devotees that He will personally redeem  and  deliver  from
all sins His devotee who lives their life  in  the  manner  just  explained.
This includes sins of commission and sins of omission that accumulated  over
uncountable lifetimes from time immemorial. Past sins  are  immense  burdens
and obstacles in achieving <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material  existence.
Then to assure that what He has stated  is  a  surety  He  states  <i>ma  sucah</i>
meaning there is no need to despair.

Another interpretation is that Lord Krishna consoles His  devotees  who  may
be stricken with grief by the thought of so many sins committed and  omitted
in countless past  lives.  For  <i>karma  yoga</i>  and  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  there  is  no
restrictions in performing actions  and  acquiring  knowledge  respectively;
but for <i>bhakti yoga</i> which is exclusive, personal loving devotion  unto  Lord
Krishna or any of His authorised  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and  expansions
such as Rama, Vamana,  Narasingha, etc. to be performed all ones  sins  must
be entirely dissolved and one must have great love for the Supreme  Lord  as
well. A devotee may have great love for the  Supreme  Lord  but  eradicating
all one's sins is another matter. There are only two ways to  eradicate  all
sins.  Either  by  the  acceptance  of  the  Vaisnava  spiritual  master  in
authorised disciplic succession who takes  all  one's   sins  and  transfers
them upwards to his guru who transfers them  upwards  to  his  guru  and  so
forth and so on all the way back to Lord Krishna  who  personally  dissolves
them all immediately is one way.  The  other  way  is  by  personal  effort.
Reflecting on all the sins one has accumulated since the beginning  of  time
and then not even the committed sins but only just  the  omitted  sins  like
not fasting from grains on <i>Ekadasi</i> when all sins of the world  enter  grains
on the 11th day of the new and full  moons  is  enough  for  a   devotee  to
become quite dismayed. In a human lifetime of Earth it is  not  possible  to
exhaust by expiatory rituals and  austerities  all  the  sins  hoarded  over
innumerable lifetimes. There is not enough time so contemplating their  lack
of qualification a sincere devotee would despair. To  console  His  devotees
Lord Krishna omnisciently understands that to eradicate all  the  myriad  of
sins accumulated over unlimited  lives  by  expiatory  ceremonies  would  be
futile in the short span of life a human  being  has.  Such  ceremonies  are
difficult to conduct successfully, are costly and time consuming and so  any
chance of successfully eradicating all one's sins in this way is out of  the
question. To alleviate this difficulty Lord  Krishna  reveals  the  solution
which grants success in order to be able to  embark upon <i>bhakti yoga</i>  is  to
exclusively take complete refuge in Him. There is  no  cost  whatsoever  for
admission. The Supreme Lord who is the creator,  maintainer,  protector  and
sustainer of the total  creation,  most  magnanimously  and  compassionately
gives exclusive shelter to those who seek Him  exclusively  and  irrevocably
promises to  eradicate  all  one's  sins  which  are  the  awesome  barriers
prohibiting one from communion with  the  Supreme  Lord  and  the  ambrosial
bliss of <i>bhakti.</i>
