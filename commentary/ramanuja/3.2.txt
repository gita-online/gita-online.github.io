What Arjuna is trying to ascertain from Lord Krishna is if  the  cultivation
of spiritual knowledge is superior to  performing  physical  activities  for
the attainment of liberation and  if  so  then  why  should  one  engage  in
horrendous activities like war and killing. It  is  well  known  that  <i>jnana</i>
<i>yoga</i> or the cultivation of spiritual knowledge is the  means  to  accomplish
self-realisation of the soul. <i>Karma yoga</i> or performing  physical  activities
without  attachment  leads  one  gradually  to  <i>jnana  yoga.</i>  This  path  of
spiritual knowledge can be attained by with drawing  all  the  senses  along
with the mind from the objects of the senses.  If  this  is  the  case  then
Arjuna is wondering why he is not being instructed in the cessation  of  all
physical activities; but instead he is being encouraged  to  fully  use  his
mind and senses to engage in all of  the  violent  and  horrific  activities
that accompany warfare. Feeling confused by the conflicting instructions  of
with drawing the senses and the performance of actions, Arjuna now  wants  a
single, unequivocal  instruction  to  determine  for  certain  exactly  what
course he should embark to achieve the highest good.
