<i>Karma</i> or actions has two aspects. The action of using the paraphernalia  and
ingredients to perform it is one aspect and the  spiritual  intelligence  to
perform it properly is the second aspect. The  second  aspect  of  spiritual
knowledge  is  superior  to  the  first  aspect   consisting   of   material
ingredients. All activities  culmimnate  in  wisdom.  Any  action  performed
without  directed intelligence is meaningless. Hence all  activities  should
be performed with wisdom involved being  that  spiritual  knowledge  is  the
goal that is desired to be  reached  by  every  means  possible  uatntil  by
constant endeavour one attains the final attainment.
