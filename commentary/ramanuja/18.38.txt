On Earth, on other worlds, in the higher celestial  spheres  and  the  lower
demoniac planets, in all of creation from the highest material  being  known
as Brahma down to a simple plant; there is  no  living  entity  anywhere  in
material existence that is exempt from the influence of the three  <i>gunas</i>  or
modes of material nature which arise from <i>prakriti</i> the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence. Yet as the Vedic scriptures confirm  by  <i>tyaga</i>
or renunciation  one  is  released  from  the  enslavement  of  <i>samsara</i>  the
perpetual cycle of birth and death and achieves  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material existence. As the means to <i>moksa</i> the <i>tyaga</i>  does  not  differ  from
the meaning <i>sannyasa</i> symbolises which is also renunciation.  Both  mean  the
same and do not consider  themselves  the  doer;  but  <i>tyaga</i>  renounces  the
desire for rewards for actions and <i>sannyasa</i> renounces all actions.
1) Renunciation of rewards
2) Renunciation of thinking one is the doer
3) Renunciation for recognition for actions
These three are realised by knowing that all is accomplished solely  by  the
grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna alone and no other.  This  elevated  state
of consciousness can only be perceived under  the  dominating  influence  of
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness and never <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion  or
<i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance. In  order  to  give  credence  and  inspire
regard for <i>sattva guna</i> that it is most worthy to be cultivated Lord  Krishna
had to show the demerits and deficiencies of <i>raja</i> and <i>tama guna</i> as well.

Now that the complex elaboration of the three <i>gunas</i> and their  influence  on
the previously mentioned subjects by  modifying  them  to  manifest  natural
expression among the various classes of society while  conforming  to  their
individual and collective levels  and  classifications  of  existence.  This
will be illustrated to exemplify that all  activities  pertaining  to  <i>moksa</i>
are of the nature of  transcendence  and  are  actually  performed  for  the
Supreme Lord. When  such  is  invariably  the  case  the  actions  performed
themselves become the goal assuring communion with the Supreme Lord will  be
attained. How this is to be lucid and comprehensible will be revealed next.
