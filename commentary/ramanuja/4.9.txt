Whosoever is able to verily  realise  the  divine,  spiritual  and  uniquely
phenomenal  nature  of  the  Supreme   Lord   Krishna's   incarnations   and
transcendental pastimes which are exclusively manifested for the benefit  of
all those who take refuge in Him solely  and  which  are  intended  for  the
protection of  the  righteous  who  understand  the  real  <i>tattva</i>  or  truth
concerning His appearances. The word <i>divyam</i> in  this  verse  meaning  divine
confirms that Lord Krishna appearance is not  the  same  as  the  compulsory
births of the conditioned embodied entities  as  a  consequent  reaction  to
their past life activities arising from  their   timeless  interaction  with
<i>prakriti</i> or material nature. So in conclusion whoever understands  that  all
<i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  emanate  from  Lord  Krishna  who  is   eternally
possessed with all glorious  qualities  and  wonderful  attributes,  such  a
person is not subject to rebirth once they leave  their  present  body,  but
attains the  eternal  spiritual  abode  with  the  Supreme  Lord.  Put  more
succinctly such a person possessing accurate discriminative  knowledge  from
disciplic  succession  regarding  Lord  Krishna's  incarnations  and  divine
pastimes becomes free from all sins which stand in  the  way  of  coming  to
Him. Such a person in  there  present  birth  will  attain  Him  by  placing
implicit reliance and full faith in Him in the manner described in  previous
verses  and by making Him the be all  and  end  all  of  their  lives  makes
themselves extremely dear to the Lord which qualifies  their  existence  for
attaining Him. Next will be described the  superb  godly  qualities  of  the
these saintly persons.
