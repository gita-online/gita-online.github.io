Lord Krishna is declaring that what is known  as  <i>sannyasa</i>  or  renunciation
and what is known as <i>yoga</i> or the science  of  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciouness are all leading  to  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the soul and are  only  different  forms  of  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> or prescribed  Vedic  activities.  No  one  can  perform  <i>yoga</i>  who  is
infatuated  by  delusion.  The  words  <i>asannyasta-sankalpo</i>   means   without
renouncing the desire for rewards Without renunciation is  not  possible  to
be free from delusion for the error is there of mistaking the physical  body
as the <i>atma</i> or soul. One who by  the  power  of  self  introspection  gleans
knowledge by meditation of the  <i>atma</i>  within  the  etheric  heart  of  their
physical body is freed from this delusion. No one who has  failed  to  shake
off the binding fetters of  hankering  for  rewards  and  desire  for  sense
pleasures is under the sway of delusion  is  never  regarded  as  performing
<i>karma yoga</i> nor considered a real renunciate.
