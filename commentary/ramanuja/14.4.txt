Whatever  forms  that  are  generated  into  existence  from  the  wombs  of
demigods, demons, human, animal, birds, reptile,  fish,  etc.  all  manifest
from the great womb of inanimate existence within the <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence and is known  as  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material
substratum pervading physical existence by dint of its  modifications  known
as the three <i>gunas</i> of <i>sattva</i> or goodness, <i>rajas</i>  or  passion  and  <i>tamas</i>  or
nescience. These modifications manifest due to circumstances  based  on  the
individual <i>karma</i> of unlimited <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings who are  embedded  by
the Supreme Lord with the animate aspect  known  as  the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal
soul. This is the cause of all created beings and thus Lord Krishna is  thus
the father of all. The primary reason for such diverse generating  of  <i>jivas</i>
will be given next.
