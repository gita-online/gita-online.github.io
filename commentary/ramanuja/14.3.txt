Inanimate and inert earth, water, fire,  air,  ether  along  with  <i>manas</i>  or
mind, <i>buddhi</i> or  intelligence  and  <i>ahankara</i>  or  ego  all  constitute  Lord
Krishna's  eightfold  differentiated  aspects  of   matter.  But  they  only
comprise His external energy and are inferior.  The  <i>mahad-brahma</i>  signifies
the infinite extension of <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading
physical  existence  by  dint  of  its  being  the  primal  source  of   all
variegations   of   species   and   subspecies   which    emanate    thereof
correspondingly in the forms of <i>manas, buddhi</i> and <i>ahankara.</i>  Passages  found
in  various  Vedic  scriptures  sometime  refer  to   <i>prakriti</i>  in  specific
circumstances  in  the  purview  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all  existence.  An  example  is  seen  in  the  Mundaka  Upanisad
II.II.VII. beginning <i>yah sarvajnah sarvavid</i> which states: The  Supreme  Lord
is omniscient and omnipotent and His  glory  is  pervading  through  all  of
creation. He eternally  dwells  in  <i>Vaikuntha</i>  the  eternal,  transcendental
spiritual worlds  and  simultaneously  with  the  heart  of  every  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being. The term <i>garbha</i> means seed as in embryo in the form  of  all
the animate myriad trillions of <i>atmas</i> or immortal souls  manifesting  within
the <i>jivas</i> en masse at the time of their appearance.  So  in  the  inanimate,
womb like nature of <i>prakriti</i> the Supreme Lord casts  the  animate  seeds  in
aggregate corresponding precisely to the exact finite number  of  <i>atmas</i>  for
every <i>jiva</i> in creation. The purport is that  the  Supreme  Lord  impregnates
material nature with souls in the form of incalculable living  enities  that
assume unlimited forms  throughout  material  existence.  The  <i>ksetrajna</i>  or
knower of the field  of  activity  uniting  with  the  <i>ksetra</i>  or  field  of
activity.  Thus are  all  <i>jivas</i>  from  Brahma  down  to  a  one-cell  amoeba
manifested by the combination of the  aforementioned  principles;  generated
by the will of the Supreme Lord. That such  manifestation  is  actually  and
factually from the Supreme Lord will be given next.
