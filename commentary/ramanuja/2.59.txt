Until and unless self-realisation is attained by direct soul  cognition  the
cravings and attachments for sensual experiences will never  entirely  cease
to  exist  subtly  or  physically.  The  concerted  exertions  of  even  the
persevering yogi can all be to no avail against the  restless  and  powerful
senses of which any one of them can forcibly decoy the  mind  astray.   Thus
the conquest of the senses is ultimately dependent upon realisation  of  the
eternal soul and the perception of the soul is  dependent  upon  control  of
the senses. Thus  Lord  Krishna  alludes  to  the  difficulty  there  is  in
striving for soul cognition following  <i>jnana-nishta</i>  by knowledge only.
