Lord Krishna explains that by <i>yagna</i> which is worship and appeasement of  the
<i>devas</i> or demi-gods who are His  universal  administrators  of  the  material
existence and who constitute His body and of whom He is  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul
within. Later in chapter IX.xxiv beginning with <i>aham hi sarva</i>  we  will  see
Him confirm that He is the sole enjoyer and rewarder of all <i>yagnas.</i>  So  let
the demi-gods of whom Lord Krishna is the <i>atma</i> be worshipped  so  they  will
grant all prayers of prosperity and  abundance.  In  this  way  by  mutually
offering  services  mankind  shall  reap  its  summum  bonum   and   highest
beatitude.
