If through injudicious sentiment or bewildered ignorance Arjuna should  fail
to perform his prescribed duty as a <i>ksatriya</i> by fighting  for  the  sake  of
righteousness; he would lose a most excellent opportunity of  attaining  the
heavenly spheres, he would lose his reputation as a hero and he  would  have
to accept great sinful reaction.
