The words <i>man mana</i> means be always conscious of  Lord  Krishna.  This  means
one's consciousness should always be focused on Him as a  continuous  stream
of thought. The Supreme Lord of all,  the  sole  abode  of  all  excellence,
devoid of any fault, the  omniscient,  omnipotent  and  omnipresent  One  of
indomitable will. The Supreme Lord Krishna, the sole source, the sole  cause
and the sole  origin  of  all  creation,  who  is  <i>Parabrahman</i>  the  supreme
manifestation of  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  and
<i>Purusottama</i> the supreme personality, who possesses large,  beautiful,  lotus
shaped eyes and whose transcendental body is of dark blue  complexion.  Lord
Krishna resplendent as 1000 suns simultaneously shining,  Lord  Krishna  the
epitome of all beauty and loveliness with  effulgent  yellow  hued  raiment,
ornate and immaculate diadem, dolphin shaped  earrings,  celestial  garlands
and ungents, bracelets, rings and armlets. Lord Krishna  <i>isvara  parama</i>  the
ultimate controller of all, who is an ocean of infinite  mercy,  compassion,
beauty, sweetness, perfection, bounty  and  affection.  The  refuge  of  all
planes  of  existence  in  all  the  trillions  of  universes  without   any
contradiction in any of them regardless of uniqueness and differences.  Lord
Krishna the Supreme Sovereign Lord of all.
<p>
Furthemore one should be <i>mad bhakto</i> or have  their  consciousness  permeated
with unadulterated love for Lord Krishna as their beloved friend.  Then  one
should become <i>maj yaji</i> or Lord Krishna's  devoted  worshipper  taking  great
delight in their intimate and individual relationship with the Supreme  Lord
internally. <i>Yaja</i> denoting <i>yagna</i> indicates all the myriad  of  wonderful  and
sublime ways of offering <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion unto  Lord  Krishna,  the
way a dear friend offers everything they  possess  to  please  another  dear
friend. Offering as <i>yaji</i> is of three kinds.
<p>
<i>1) aupacharika</i> is external worship such as offering incense and waving  ghee
lamps,  fanning etc.
<i>2) samsparsika</i> is tactual service  such  as  garlanding,  applying  ungents,
smearing sandalwood paste, etc.
<i>3) abhyaaharika</i> is offering  of  vegetarian  food  such  as  milk  products,
fruits and vegetables.
<p>
<i>Yaji</i> is thus rendering all kinds of pleasing  and  delectable  services  for
Lord Krishna's supreme satisfaction and  this  whether  great  or  small  is
accomplished perfectly by <i>bhakti</i>  or loving devotion and by no other  means.
The purport is: Let my mind be so aligned that it  takes  great  delight  in
always rendering such pleasing services to the Supreme Lord Krishna.
<p>
Next is advised <i>namaskuru</i> which is the humble prostration of obeisance  unto
the Supreme Lord. This infers to not let  one's  mind  merely  bask  in  the
satisfaction of rendering service out of infinite love created  by  communal
bliss with the Supreme Lord but  to  also  be  prostrated  in  homage   with
humility to the Supreme Lord as the internal  monitor  within  as  <i>Paramatma</i>
the supreme soul who witnesses all thought and activities  of  every  living
entity.
<p>
<i>Mat-parayanah</i> means one who has totally surrendered  to  the  Supreme  Lord.
Who accepts the Supreme Lord as  their  only  shelter  and  refuge  and  who
independent of Him could not tolerate  existence  therefore  such  a  person
depends completely on  Him.  Thus  disciplining  the  consciousness  in  one
pointed focus so that  everything  one  does  is  directly  related  to  the
Supreme Lord one should guide their consciousness in such a way that it  can
revel and delight in personal communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  at  every
moment. Possessed of such a wonderfully evolved spiritualised  consciousness
thou shalt most assuredly attain the Supreme Lord  without  fail.  The  word
<i>atma</i> used here denotes the consciousness beyond the mind.
<p>
The import of this verse is that if a person  prepares  and  develops  their
consciousness to meditate on the Supreme Lord, to render loving  service  to
the Supreme Lord,  to  delight  in  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord,  to
prostrate in humble homage to the Supreme  Lord,  then  putting  their  full
trust to Him alone they will undoubtedly attain Him.
<p>
So practically one should perform all worldly duties  required  to  maintain
bodily subsistence and then to please the Supreme  Lord  one  should  adhere
the ordinances of the Vedic scriptures fulfilling both daily and  occasional
duties as to <i>varnasrama</i> or one's status and position  in  society  according
to  time  and  circumstances.  Performing  all  these  activities  for   the
satisfaction of the Supreme  Lord  one  becomes  essentially  His  dependent
although inspired and activated to perform these  services  by  the  Supreme
Lord within by His feature as <i>Paramatma</i> the supreme soul. Thus one  will  be
ever loving engaged in chanting the  names  of  Lord  Krishna,  singing  His
praises, reciting His glories, rendering services, prostrating  before  Him.
Thou  shalt  realise  that  every  aspect  of  creation,  preservation   and
dissolution is under His Supreme authority, rule  and  guidance  and  is  in
fact His appendage.  Meditating  daily  in  full  devotion,  reflecting  and
marvelling  over  the  unlimited  multitude  of  phenomenal  qualities   and
marvellous attributes such a blessed soul attains the ultimate goal  of  all
existence,  eternal  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  in  their  eternal
spiritual form.
