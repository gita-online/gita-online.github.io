Now Lord Krishna states that <i>danam</i>  or  charity  given  at  an  inauspicious
location such as in cities  where  cows  are  slaughtered,  at  inauspicious
times such as dark of night and to inauspicious persons such as meat  eaters
are situated in <i>tama guna</i> the mode of darkness. Also showing  disrespect  by
failing to properly welcome a worthy recipient such as a  Vaisnava  brahmana
who knows <i>atma tattva</i> or knowledge of the immortal  soul.  As  also  showing
disdain by failing to wash his feet and drink the water,  showing  dishonour
by failing to offer ceremonial  etiquette  by  performing  <i>arati</i>  of  waving
lamps, incense and flowers, etc. are all considered to be in <i>tama  guna</i>  the
mode of ignorance even if accompanied with opulent gifts.
