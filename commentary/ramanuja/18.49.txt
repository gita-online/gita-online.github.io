<i>Buddhi</i>  is  spiritual  intelligence  the  consciousness  which   exclusively
focuses on the <i>atma</i>.
<i>Manas</i> refers to the mind, senses  and  body  which  acting  in  such  a  way
discourages desires for sense gratification  and  encourages  reflection  on
the Supreme Lord. <i>Vairagyam-samipasritah</i> means renouncing the objects  which
the senses hanker for and indifference to  mundane  pursuits.  It  is  while
chasing such pursuits that occasionally friendship or enmity  transpires  so
ceasing from these pursuits would free one from <i>raga-dvesau</i>  attraction  and
repulsion. <i>Vivikta-sevi</i> is seeking solitude  in  remote  places  aloof  from
disturbances to meditation.  Moderation  in  eating  and  sleeping.  <i>Dhyana-</i>
<i>yoga</i> means internally  performing  continuous  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving
devotional service unto the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of  His  <i>avatars</i>  or
incarnations and expansions as authorised  in  Vedic  scriptures.  Gradually
increasing aversion towards anything that is not connected to  the  <i>atma</i>  or
immortal soul and the Supreme Lord. <i>Ahankaram</i> is egoistic  conceptions  that
considers the body to be all in all and cannot discern  that  they  are  not
their physical body. <i>Balam</i> is lust for power, <i>darpan</i> is vain  conceit  which
is derived from it and <i>nirmanam</i> is the notion  one  possesses  what  is  not
one's own. <i>Santah</i> is  tranquillity   peacefulness,  the  serenity  of  bliss
acquired by  constant  reflection  and  meditation  upon  the  Supreme  Lord
qualifies one to achieve realisation of the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence and and achieving <i>moksa</i> or liberation from  material
existence attains <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation and enters into the  bliss
of communion with the Supreme Lord.
