The word <i>purve</i> meaning predecessor establishes a  link  to  the  past.  This
past is the previous <i>manvantara</i> or age of Manu. From the mind of Brahma  the
seven great  sages  Marici,  Atri,  Angiras,  Pulastya,  Pulaha,  Kratu  and
Vasistha were all born to inaugurate the day  arising  of  Brahma.  Although
Bhrgu was also born from the mind  of  Brahma  and  a  great  sage,  he  was
subsequent to the others.  The  four  Manus  named  Savarnikas  are  Brahma,
Rudra, Dharma  and  Daksa  and  they  are  responsible  for  overseeing  the
maintenance of creation. The fourteen Manus named Manvantaras are headed  by
Syambhuva Manu and are appointed to  administrate  the  creation  for  their
allotted time span. All the human beings in creation  are  descendants  from
these aforementioned. They materially create and  materially  sustain  their
descendants which includes the whole  human  population  in  creation  every
moment throughout time until the commencement  of  the  cosmic  dissolution.
Lord Krishna  states  the  words  <i>mad-bhava</i>  meaning  of  His  nature,  this
confirms that Brahma, Rudra, the  Manus,  the  seven  sages,  etc.  are  all
endowed with His nature and imbued with a  spark  of  His  potency  and  are
followers of His divine plan in all situations and circumstances.
