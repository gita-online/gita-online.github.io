Lord Krishna explains that the demoniac are  propelled  by  lust  and  greed
that is insatiable and constantly seeking to be fulfilled  in  the  hope  of
being gratified. The demoniac endeavour to procure such fulfilment is  <i>mohad</i>
or  deluded  illusion  and  through  gross  improprieties  they   forcefully
misappropriate and enjoy things which are not lawfully theirs. The  compound
word <i>asuci-vratah</i> means the demoniac fiendishly   execute  devilish  rituals
such as blood sacrifices and the killing  of  animals  and  even  humans  in
following their diabolical rites. Specifically engaging  in  forbidden  acts
prohibited by the Vedic scriptures which oppose all sense of  righteousness,
morality and decency. By resorting to duplicity,  hypocrisy,  sorcery,  evil
magic, and surreptitious deception the demoniac nature is  able  to  prevail
and flourish.
