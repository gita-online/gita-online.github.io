That person situated in <i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation  of  Vedic  wisdom  is
very knowledgeable  with  the  Vedic  declarations  regarding  the  distinct
difference between the <i>atma</i> or soul and <i>prakriti</i> or material nature. Such  a
person is also completely aware of the fact that  the  <i>atma</i>  should  be  the
sole  object  of  their  contemplation  and  meditation.  But  despite  this
knowledge it is seen  that  due  to  the  deep  influence  of  <i>samskaras</i>  or
impressions from past life activities,  they  are  carried  along  by  their
subsequent nature which forces them to  be  act  in  the  current  of  their
natural  tendencies  and  they  find  themselves  preoccupied  with  various
material pursuits enjoying assorted material sense objects.  The  reason  is
that  living  entities  become  indoctrinated  and  content  with   whatever
relationship they establish in their environment.  In other  words  whatever
habits they form from their  association  with  <i>prakriti</i>  they  continue  to
maintain and persistently follow. With the overpowering influence  of  these
deep rooted habits  how  can  the  words  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  impose
restraint on such a person? One is helplessly carried away by  the  forceful
current of past life actions and impressions.

The objects of the senses  are  perceived  through  the  sense  organs.  For
example hearing is perceived by the ears through sound, seeing is  perceived
by the eyes through sight, smelling is perceived by the nose through  smells
and so on. For each of the senses one has affection and the desire to  enjoy
through them. But the same senses  operate  depending  upon   attraction  or
aversion to sense objects. For sense  objects  that  are  pleasing  one  has
attraction for pleasure and for sense objects that are displeasing  one  has
aversion to displeasure. All  these  habits  are  conditioned  from  ancient
predilections of past life reminisces.  Such  dualities  of  attraction  and
aversion  obstructs  one  who  would  want  to  succeed  in  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  by
subjugating  their  sense.  These  dualities  which  can  be  understood  as
different degrees of  love and hate, hold a  person  in  an  iron  grip  and
forcefully drive them to commit actions that are  in  conformance  with  the
attributes of one of the three  <i>gunas</i>  of  goodness,  passion  or  nescience
which one's nature adheres to from past life impressions. Thus one is  being
constantly diverted from the real purpose of human existence, that  of  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the soul and their precious human  life  is  wasted
pursuing  sense objects.
