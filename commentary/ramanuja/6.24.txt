The words <i>sarvatra sama-darsana</i> means equal vision  everywhere.  This  means
realising the <i>atma</i> or soul that  abides  in  oneself  and  abides  in  other
beings is of the same transcendental essence in all beings equally. This  is
perceived by spiritual consciousness and this transcendental essence  is  an
attribute  equally  present  in  all  <i>atma's.</i>  The  equality,  sameness  and
luminosity of the <i>atma</i> has been perceived by those recipients  of  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation when the <i>atma</i> is divested of its  connection  with  the  physical
body and material nature. Inequality as well as indifference  and  indolence
arise from designating the <i>atma</i> as being non-different from  the  myriad  of
multifarious physical manifestations the <i>atma</i> is embodied by.  The  <i>yogi</i>  or
one  perfecting  the  science  of  the  individual  consciousness  with  the
ultimate consciousness, who mature in  <i>dhyana</i>  or  meditation  has  achieved
<i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul, does not discern any differences  in
the myriad of multifarious physical manifestations but  perceives  the  <i>atma</i>
wherever it may reside in whatever physical or subtle body it manifests  in.
This is  perceived  by  the  <i>atma's</i>  inherent  and  essential  attribute  of
transcendental consciousness existing equally in all beings. Such is  actual
equal vision and one who perceives the <i>atma</i> abiding  within  oneself  is  of
exactly the same essence, nature and quality as the <i>atma</i>  perceived  abiding
in other beings realises that such beings are equal  in  this  respect.  The
conclusion of what Lord Krishna is stating is that all <i>atma's</i>  are  eternal,
from one eternal essence and that when one's own <i>atma</i> has been realised  and
perceived then every beings <i>atma</i> is realised and be perceived.
