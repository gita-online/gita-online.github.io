Lord Krishna reveals that one  who  truly  perceives  understands  that  all
actions proceed from the agency of <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum  that
pervades physical existence. One perceives that  for  creating  effects  and
instruments insentient <i>prakriti</i> is the cause. One perceives  that  the  <i>atma</i>
or immortal soul although sentient is  not  the  doer.  One  perceives  that
<i>tamas</i> or ignorance in the shape of <i>karma</i> or  reactions  to  actions  is  the
reason for forced confinement in  the  material  existence,  the  terms  and
conditions of the confinement and the experiences of pleasure  and  pain  in
correlation with the duration of the confinement. One  who  comprehends  all
these truly perceives reality.
