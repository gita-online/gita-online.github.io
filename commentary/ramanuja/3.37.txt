The most powerful obstruction in their pursuit of <i>jnana yoga</i> or the path  of
cultivating Vedic knowledge is <i>kama</i> or lust. The intense addiction to  enjoy
sense objects. This addiction is fueled by past habits such  as  remembering
senses enjoyed or by senses frustrated  in  the  attempt  to  satisfy  one's
desires. Because the person is helplessly attached  to  the  attraction  and
aversion of the three <i>gunas</i> or goodness , passion and  nescience  which  are
constantly fluctuating the mind and senses  influencing  all  beings.   This
<i>kama</i> is a most powerful enemy and exerting its power  compels  a  person  to
enter into its province of sense delights in pursuit of  pleasure.  Then  if
by chance while in the pursuit of sense delights one's desires are  thwarted
or frustrated then this same lust transforms itself into intense  <i>krodha</i>  or
anger. Enacting sinful actions in the attempt to  satisfy  one's  frustrated
senses even if  futilely  and  prepared  to  perpetrate  even  violent  acts
against anyone that thwarts in any way the gratification  of  their  senses.
It should be known that <i>kama</i> and <i>krodha</i> arise from <i>rajas guna</i>  or  the  mode
of passion and it is a very hostile adversary to those who  are  engaged  in
<i>jnana yoga.</i>
