So because verily the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being is subject to the  sanction  of
<i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme  Soul,  one  should  never  consider  themselves  as
independent nor think of themselves as the doer of  anything.  Lord  Krishna
states  that  one  who  erroneously  does  so  will  be  <i>durmati</i>  one  whose
intelligence is perverted and deluded and thus bewildered is oblivious  that
other elements are the essential factors in manifesting all activities.
