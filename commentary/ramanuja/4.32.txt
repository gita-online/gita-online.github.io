Lord Krishna has  described  the  12  different  performances  of  <i>yagna</i>  or
offerings of worship in propitiation to the Supreme Lord that are the  means
of attaining <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation  performed  in  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or
prescribed Vedic activities.  It  should  be  clearly  understood  that  all
<i>yagnas</i> manifest from activity of the  mind,  the  speech  or  the  body  and
involve the performance of  regular  daily  duties  and  occasional  special
duties. Understanding this wisdom and practically  applying  this  knowledge
one shall by their own efforts dissolve all their sins and become free  from
<i>samsara</i> or bondage frrom the cycle  of  birth  and  death  in  the  material
existence. The wisdom aspect of <i>karma</i> has  been  explained  by  showing  how
<i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of Vedic knowledge is involved in <i>karma  yoga.</i>
Next the importance of wisdom in <i>jnana yoga</i> will be elucidated.
