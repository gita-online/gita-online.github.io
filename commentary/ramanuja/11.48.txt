After gazing again on Lord Krishna in human vestige looking extraordinarily
phenomenal with four-arms and then again as a countenance of beauty with
two arms lovely to envision with tenderness, grace, majesty and naturalness
all sublimely expressing themselves ensemble and marvellous to behold.
Seeing Lord Krishna's human form so enchanting and delightful Arjuna's mind
was restored to its natural tranquillity and he became placated.
