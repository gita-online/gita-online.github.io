Lord Krishna is telling Arjuna that he has not clearly understood  what  has
been previously spoken by Him. He tells Arjuna that in this world  abounding
in diversity there are two paths for two types of humans.   <i>Jnana  yoga</i>  the
path of knowledge and <i>karma yoga</i> the path of  actions  each  suited  to  the
capacities and qualifications of the type concerned. Not all humans in  this
world  are born with the ambition for <i>moksa</i> or liberation. Neither  are  all
humans able to embark upon the path of knowledge directly.  But  all  humans
must engage in actions at all times they cannot stop but they  must  perform
these actions unattached without desiring any  reward,  perfecting  them  in
the process as factual activities  of  divine  worship.  Then  in  fact  all
actions become divine activities as revealed forthcoming in  chapter  XVIII.
verse forty-six worshipping God by  one's  actions<i>.</i>  Performing  actions  in
this way humans evaporate the inauspicious qualities lurking in their  minds
and hearts and the senses give up  their  turbulence  and  become  calm  and
peaceful. It has already been established in chapter II.  verse  forty-seven
that there must be no anticipation of rewards as the reason  for  performing
activities. When this platform has been attained then after  one  has  risen
in wisdom beyond the turmoils of the quest of satisfying  one's  sense  with
sense objects then <i>jnana yoga</i> the  cultivation  of  spiritual  knowledge  is
appropriate.  In chapter II. verse fity-five Lord Krishna  has  stated  when
one gives  up  all  desires,  to  confirm  this  point.  <i>Sankhya</i>  refers  to
spiritual knowledge or spiritual wisdom. Those who possess this  are  called
<i>sankhyas</i> as  real  spiritual  knowledge  is  the  knowledge  that  leads  to
realisation of the <i>atma</i> or soul, firmly  resides within them. Those who  are
ineligible not fit for this course due to their own inherent  qualities  are
the <i>yogis</i> who are eligible for <i>karma yoga</i> the path of actions. So it can  be
seen that there  is  not  even  the  slightest  contradiction  when  it  was
asserted that for one who is beguiled by the  objects  and  distractions  of
the phenomenal world, <i>karma yoga</i> is suitable for them and for those who  are
not beguiled and able to renounce these objects and distractions are  suited
for <i>jnana yoga</i> the cultivation of spiritual knowledge.

It will next be shown that even if a wish for  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  arises
still one may not be  fully  competent  to  experience  the  cultivation  of
knowledge  by  <i>jnana yoga.</i>
