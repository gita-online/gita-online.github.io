<i>Bhagavad-Gita: c</i><i>hapter 2, verse 14</i>
<p>
The qualities  of  sound,  feeling,  colour,  taste  and  smell  with  their
corresponding faculties known as the senses are called <i>matras</i>  because  they
manifest from the basic fundamental elements of water, fire, earth, air  and
ether.  Contact  of  the  senses  with  these  <i>matras</i>  cause  such  physical
perceptions of duality as cold and hot, hard  and  soft,  bitter  and  sweet
that are experienced as pleasure or pain.
<p>
The use of cold and heat in this verse is symbolised  as  the  summation  of
all external experiences. The Supreme  Lord  instructs  Arjuna  to  tolerate
them with courage while fulfilling  ones  duties  to  completion.  As  these
external  experiences  come  and  go  they  should  not   be   regarded   as
impediments to discharging one's responsibilities by men of courage.
<p>
Also they are <i>anitya</i> or temporary, meaning that  for  whoever  has  achieved
the termination of their <i>karma</i> as in the case of one who has attained  <i>mukti</i>
or liberation, the dualities of physical sensations are not able to  disturb
or distract. Are these experiences of the  duality  of  physical  sensations
causing the perception of pleasure  and  pain  of  any  value?  It  will  be
discoursed in the next verse.
