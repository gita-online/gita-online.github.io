The threefold activities that are the motivating force of  all  actions  are
itemised now.
1) <i>Jnanam</i> means knowledge of the activity.
2) <i>Jneyam</i> means knowing how the activity is to be accomplished.
3) <i>Parijnata</i> means the knower who performs the activity.
These three activities are prerequisite and are  the  impetus  which  impels
one to perform prescribed Vedic  activities  for  the  satisfaction  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna. Contrarily they are also the impetus to enact  mundane
activities for personal gratification. Among these three  activities  <i>jneyam</i>
is comprised of three subdivisions and explained in  context  of  the  Vedas
are:
<i>1) karanam</i> how the activity becomes  reality  such  as  by  donations  of
wealth or materials.
<i>2) karma</i> or engagement in the act itself such  as  <i>yagna</i>  or  ritualistic
propitiation.
<i>3) karta</i> the agent who performs the action or initiates the action to  be
performed.
