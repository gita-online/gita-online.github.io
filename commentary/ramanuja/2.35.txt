Whereas Arjuna had been know as a mighty warrior and renown hero,  a  worthy
opponent for any of the valiant warriors of  the  Kauravas  such  as  Karna,
Duryodhana etc. If Arjuna were to retire  from  the  fight  on  the  eve  of
battle they would all consider him  a  coward  and  they  immediately  would
assume that Arjuna had abstained from  battle due to feeling dread at  their
prowess. For Arjuna to think that he would be vindicated by  his  abstention
from battle by motives of fraternity and familial ties would  be  wrong  for
these  sentiments  are  not  considered   sanctions   for   heroes   towards
belligerents.
