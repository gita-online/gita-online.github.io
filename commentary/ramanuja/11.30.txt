The word <i>kala</i> or time is derived from  <i>kalayati</i>  which  is  synonymous  with
<i>ganayati</i> which is to calculate or count. Lord Krishna declares  He  is  time
which controls the life span of all living entities and will determine  when
Duryodhana, Bhishma, Drona and other royal dignitaries along  with  all  the
warriors will expire. Lord Krishna presently exhibited the  terrible  aspect
of the <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form in order to show He  was  directly
<i>pravritah</i> engaged to complete the activity of their destruction. By  a  mere
miniscule fiat of His will, Lord Krishna can accomplish this action  without
the assistance of anything or anyone else  and  all  the  warriors  of  both
armies Kaurava and Pandava will soon  meet  with  their  destruction  except
Arjuna and his four brothers.
