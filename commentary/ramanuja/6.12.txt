The word <i>saman</i> means straight this denotes that  the  back,  neck  and  body
should be erect and balanced in a straight posture.  By  sitting  with  legs
crossed in the lotus position or half  lotus  position  assists  in  keeping
this straight position. The word <i>sthira</i> means firm  this  denotes  that  the
seat while being comfortable should not be overly soft. The eyes should  not
be allowed to flit hither and thither in  different  directions  on  objects
near or far but should fix their focus either on the tip of the nose  or  on
the space between the eyebrows.  That was the discipline for  the  body  now
Lord Krishna gives the discipline for the  mind.  The  mind  being  tranquil
connotes contentment along with freedom from all fears.  The  compound  word
<i>brahmacari-vrate</i> means total celibacy  and  is  an  indispensable  component
insuring the containment  and  preservation  of  the  vital  energy  of  the
physical body which is  so  essential  for  development.  Keeping  the  mind
attentive and fixed internally one should meditate on the Supreme Lord.
