For obvious reasons the performance of one's own <i>dharma</i> or righteous  duties
according to <i>karma yoga</i> or actions performed according to  prescribed  Vedic
injunctions is the best course to follow even if they do not  possess  great
virtues. One's own duties are easy and natural to discharge  in  <i>karma  yoga</i>
and unattended with risk. Whereas that person performing <i>jnana yoga</i>  or  the
path of cultivating Vedic knowledge which is  most  excellent;  but  who  is
beguiled by <i>prakriti</i> or material nature  finds  it  extremely  difficult  to
achieve success. Although the path of <i>jnana yoga</i> is shorter  than  the  path
of <i>karma yoga</i> there are many dangers accosting the path of <i>jnana  yoga.</i>  The
path of <i>karma yoga</i> is performed by one most easily as  it  naturally  befits
the  person  performing  it.  Even  if  death  comes  before  one  has   the
opportunity to fulfill life's purpose and attain <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  form
the cycle of birth and death, still one's progress is  not  impeded  by  any
obstacle even death as one's merits are applied to the next  life  and  they
are born in a situation where they can easily pick up the thread from  where
they left off in the last life and continue on. Whereas  one  who   although
beguiled by <i>prakriti</i> attempts to practice <i>jnana yoga</i>  anyway  is  surrounded
by danger and obstacles on their path which deter one from  easily  adopting
and putting into practice the cultivation of Vedic wisdom.
