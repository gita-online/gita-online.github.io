Lord Krishna's manifestation  of  Himself  as  <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme  Soul
situated within the etheric heart of every <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  next  to
His expansion of the <i>atma</i> or individual immortal  soul.  The  heart  is  the
exclusive, absolute center from where  all  consciousness  radiates.  It  is
also the factual center from where all impulses  and  frequencies  originate
both  active  and  passive.  The  Brihadaranya  Upanisad  V.VI.I   beginning
<i>manomayo ayam puruso</i> states: One meditating should perceive the  resplendent
Supreme Lord the  ruler and lord of all within the heart of the  size  of  a
grain of rice. The Chandogya   Upanisad  VIII.I  beginning  <i>harih  sum  atha</i>
<i>yadidamasmin</i> states:  Within  the  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being  in  the  inner
sanctorum of the heart  abides  the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  which  is  an
infintesimal portion of <i>paramatma.</i> Hence from the  Supreme  Lord  comes  all
memory remembered from past experience. All wisdom  accruring  from  factual
true perception and inference. Intuitive knowledge  related  exclusively  to
the authority of the Vedic  scriptures  and  meditation  which  expands  the
consciousness. Contrarily also from the Supreme Lord  comes  the  antithesis
of the above which are loss  of  memory,  speculative  reasoning,  erroneous
hypothesis, conjectural suppositions and deprivation of consciousness.

The Supreme Lord is to be known by the  exclusive  authority  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. He is the <i>atma</i> within all <i>jivas,</i> the witness, the  monitor,  the
inner guide.  The terms found in the Vedas of demigod, humans, demons,  etc.
are alluding to the <i>jivatma</i> or individual immortal soul  within  the  myriad
of varieagated forms of  embodied  beings.  The  compound  word  <i>vedanta-krt</i>
refers directly to Lord Krishna's <i>avatara</i> or incarnation  of  Vedavyasa  who
compiled the Vedas and divided them into four  divisions.  It  also  denotes
the performance of  Vedic enjoined rituals. The  antonym  <i>antah</i>  also  means
the end which infers the fruits, the results of  such  rituals.  He  is  the
sole bequeather of all the fruits promised in  the  Vedic  scriptures.  This
was previously touched upon in chapter seven verses 21  and  22  where  Lord
krishna confirms that in whatever form one chooses to  worship  the  Supreme
Lord, He renders there faith firm and they obtain the  wishes  they  yearned
for from Him alone. He is also the supreme knower of  the  Vedic  scriptures
for  they  originated  from   Him   to   guide   and   teach   <i>jivas</i>   about
Himself<i>.</i> Whosoever understands the Vedic scriptures otherwise then what  has
been instructed by Lord Krishna in Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  factually  has  no
knowledge  of  it  at  all.  This  is  due  to   their   understanding   and
comprehension being influenced by under  faulty  assumptions  and  erroneous
suppositions. The Vedic scriptures  must  be  understood  exclusively     in
light of the comprehensive and full authority of the Bhagavad-Gita.
