When the mind is well governed and under control, when it  is  incapable  of
being affected by the dualities such  as  heat  and  cold,  joy  and  grief,
praise and ridicule, when in equanimity it has  become  completely  tranquil
and equipoised; at that time  the  exalted  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal  soul  can  be
realised within. The word  <i>samahitah</i>  means  situated  in  <i>samadhi</i>  or  deep
meditation and denotes that <i>atma</i> or soul  has  been  realised  in  its  true
transcendental essence. Lord Krishna uses  the  word  <i>paramatma</i>  meaning  in
this instance <i>parama</i>  or  exalted  and  <i>atma</i>  or  soul  and  refers  to  the
individual soul and not the Supreme Soul as  normally  assumed.  Designating
the individual soul in this way is to show special deference to one  who  is
endowed  with  the  aforementioned  quality  of  being  situated   deep   in
meditation enough to perceive and realise  the  eternal  and  transcendental
sublime <i>atma.</i>
