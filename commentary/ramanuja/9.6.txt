As all over infinite space which appears without support the mighty wind  is
able to blow and move everywhere. How is this  possible?  The  wind  blowing
and infinite space itself is only possible due to the power of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna and yet His power  cannot  be  perceived.   Thus  all  creation
abides within Him without knowing  it.  Those  knowledgeable  of  the  Vedic
scriptures declare <i>megodayas sagara  sanni-vritti-rindor  vibhagas  sphurati</i>
<i>va yo etc.</i> meaning:The genesis of the clouds, the massing of the  seas,  the
phases of the moon, the wafting of the wind, the flashing of  lightning  and
the processions of the sun are all the marvellous miracles  of  the  Supreme
Lord.  This  is  also  confirmed  in  the  Brihadaranya  Upanisad  V.VIII.IX
beginning  <i>etasya  va  aksarasya</i>  meaning:  By  the  sole  command  of   the
imperishable Supreme Lord the sun and moon are supported in  their  assigned
spheres. The  Taittriya  Upanisad  II.VIII.I  beginning  <i>bhisha  smad  vatah</i>
<i>pavate</i> states: Out of fear of the Supreme Lord the wind blows, out  of  fear
of the Supreme Lord the sun rises. It is by a mere fiat of the Supreme  Lord
Krishna's will  alone  that  the  complete  cosmic  manifestaion  and  total
material creation full of unlimited moving  and  non-moving  beings  are  in
existence and this is what has been revealed as absolute. In the next  verse
will be revealed that the origin, creation and dissolution of all beings  is
likewise produced by a fiat of His will as well.
