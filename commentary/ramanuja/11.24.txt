Viewing the phenomenal panorama of forms and terrifying  visages  in  active
mode of Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form which was  blazing
flames in all directions was terrible  and  horrifying  like  the  fires  of
annihilation during the cataclysm at  the  time  of  universal  destruction.
Arjuna being extremely  afflicted  beseeched  Lord  Krishna  with  the  word
<i>devasa</i> denoting O' Lord of Brahma and Siva and the  words  <i>jagan-nivasan</i>  O'
refuge of the universe  and then supplicated  Lord  Krishna  with  the  word
<i>prasida</i> or be merciful and return his normal human vision  so that he  would
be able to regain his equilibrium and composure again.
<p>
So the Supreme Lord Krishna exhibiting His  <i>visvarupa</i>  demonstrated  how  it
manifested from Him, functioned through Him and existed within Him. He  will
now show to Arjuna how by His indomitable  will  He  will  bring  about  the
destruction of Duryodhana and all the Kauravas along with all the demons  in
the guise  of  kings  fighting  with  them.  Also  He  will  also  show  the
destruction of all those possessed of <i>asuric</i> or demoniac nature that may  be
fighting for kings in the army  of  the  Pandavas,  so  that  <i>Bhumi-devi</i>  or
Mother Earth will be rid of such a burden. At this time Arjuna began to  see
with the divine vision bequeathed by Lord Krishna how all the hosts  of  the
Kaurava army met with their destruction  and  by  who  although  the  actual
event had not yet transpired.
