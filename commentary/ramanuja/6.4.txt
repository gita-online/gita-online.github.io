Lord Krishna uses the compound word <i>yogarudhas</i> which is an adept  in  <i>dhyana</i>
<i>yoga</i> or the science of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion
with  the  ultimate  consciousness  by  meditation.  Such  a   person   from
experiencing the sublime bliss of the <i>atma</i> or soul within has ceased  to  be
infatuated by sensual objects and is no longer deluded by  the  impulses  of
the senses in relation to  such  sense  objects.  The  words  <i>na  anusajjate</i>
meaning not enamoured denotes that one is no longer under the  influence  of
such delusions. One is <i>yogarudhas</i> who has abandoned all illusions and  false
conceptions. Thus for the aspirant of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence who still is under the sway of infatuation and delusion  there  is
no alternative but to perform <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic  activities  as
the means to relinquish oneself from from dross of  bodily  association  and
carnal desires. This being accomplished one  has  qualified  themselves  for
<i>dhyana yoga</i> and can begin to perfect their  meditation.  Hence  as  warning,
before this point it is recommended to exclusively perform <i>karma yoga</i>  until
completely free from the infatuation of desires and sense objects.
