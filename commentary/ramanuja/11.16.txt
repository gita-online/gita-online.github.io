Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form  was  a  mass  of  blazing
radiant glory, dazzling the vision in all directions. It  had  an  effulgent
brilliance that was  more  lustrous  then  the  sun  and  was  adorned  with
unlimited diadems, unlimited sceptres wielding unlimited  <i>cakras</i>  or  discs.
It was immeasurable and beyond any conception of imagination.
