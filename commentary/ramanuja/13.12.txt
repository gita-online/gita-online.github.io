Lights are those found in the sun, the stars, fire, gems, etc. The light  of
these lights denotes that which illuminates all these or that by which  they
are perceived denoting the light of consciousness by  which  all  luminaries
such as the sun and the stars are seen to shine. As for  human  made  lights
such as  lamps,  torches  and  the  rest,  they  only  dispel  the  darkness
intervening  between  the  sense  of  sight  and  its   object   and   their
illuminating power is limited to the sense perception of  sight.  But  there
is no limitation with the light and sight of  the  <i>atma</i>  once  it  has  been
realised. The words <i>tamasah param</i> means beyond  darkness  referring  to  the
darkness  of  <i>tamas</i>  or  ignorance  designating  the  subtle   but   limited
conditions  of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence; but the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul being eternal is transcendental  to
any conditions or limitations.  The  words  <i>jnanam  jneyam</i>  means  knowledge
worthy of being known comprehensible by the intellect and  characterised  by
consciousness. The words <i>jnana  gamyam</i>    means  wisdom  accessible  through
knowledge or that wisdom gained from embodying and  living  the  20  virtues
given in verses 8 through 12 beginning with <i>amanitvam</i>  or  reverence.  These
exalted virtues which  constitute  spiritual  knowledge  are  the  means  to
achieve the wisdom of the <i>atma</i>. As the <i>atma</i> is situated within the heart  of
all sentient beings, the Supreme Lord Krishna known as  <i>Parabrahma</i>  is  <i>hrdi</i>
<i>sarvasy dhisthitam</i> situated in the heart of all sentient beings.
