Those who are imbued with <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness become  attracted
to activities in purity and goodness and they  are  devoted  to  worshipping
the Supreme Lord with full faith, concerned  only  with  the  transcendental
bliss derived from <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive  loving  devotion  unto  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna which is completely transcendental to  material  existence  and
untainted by darkness and suffering. Those in <i>raja guna</i> or mode  of  passion
offer diabolical rituals to demoniac entities from the physical  and  astral
realms to gain pleasure, power, wealth and fame.  The  results  are   bitter
sweet when succeeding and bitterly painful when failing because one  has  to
give something physical in return such as the death of a  family  member  or
one's health. Those in <i>tama guna</i> or mode of  ignorance  pay  homage  to  the
ghosts and spirits which give no joy and is filled with  pain  and  anguish.
The results of these three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature are  determined
directly by whichever one is situated in  along  with  the  quality  of  the
faith in which the worshipper is performing even  if  it  is  in  accordance
with the Vedic scriptures. Lord Krishna  has  categorically  emphasised  and
declared that not even the most miniscule modicum of  happiness  is  derived
from any activity which is contrary and opposed  to  the  Vedic  scriptures;
which embody all that is for  the  highest  good  for  all.  Those  who  are
inimical to the Vedic scriptures which benefit all  creation  are  evil  and
possess a demoniac nature.
