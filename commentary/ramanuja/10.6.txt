The word <i>vibhuti</i> means transcendental potencies of  majestic  opulence  such
as displayed in all of  the  phenomenal  activities  manifest  in  creation,
preservation and sustenance and all of the wondrous  workings  of  unlimited
universes. The word <i>yogam</i> or the science  of  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness  denotes  the  consensus
of all glorious attributes with the  exemption  of  all  that  is  evil  and
unrighteous.  Whosoever  comprehensively  understands  the   preceding   and
realises the Supreme Lord  Krishna  through  these  two  components  of  His
character being <i>vibhuti</i> and <i>yoga</i> will succeed in  acquiring  unwavering  and
rapt <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion. This means that the  knowledge  of
respecting and honouring His <i>vibhuti</i> and <i>yoga</i> by  observing,  pondering  and
reflecting how they manifest and operate as phenomenal  material  activities
and divine attributes will assist and facilitate  the  awakening  of  <i>bhakti</i>
and this can be practically experienced by all who think of Lord Krishna  in
this way. Next will be explained how the development of <i>bhakti</i> is  a  direct
result of knowledge of Lord Krishna's <i>vibhuti.</i>
