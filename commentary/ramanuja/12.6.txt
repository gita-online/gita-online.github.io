Inasmuch as the Supreme Lord  Krishna  is  the  paramount  of  all  and  the
ultimate achievement being the highest possible attainment  for  all  living
entities throughout creation, one  should  dedicate  themselves  exclusively
for His satisfaction so He will become easily and swiftly  attained  by  His
desire. Let thy <i>manas</i> or mind  and  <i>buddhim</i>  or  spiritual  intelligence  be
fully reposed in the Supreme Lord remembering Him always and let  thy  heart
be full of <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion for Him. Thus when  the  mind
has been trained and disciplined and the heart has been infused with  divine
love then <i>urdhvam</i>  meaning  after  this  life,  one  will  reside  with  Him
eternally in the spiritual worlds. Lord Krishna emphasises this  as  reality
with the words <i>na samsayah</i> meaning without a doubt.
