Lord Krishna  is  unconditionally  confirming  that  there  is  no  loss  or
diminution in their  present  life  or  in  their  next  life  for  one  who
sincerely and earnestly engages themselves in <i>yoga</i> or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness; but who later discontinues the practice due  to  weakness  of
mind and lack of dispassion. The word <i>vinasas</i> means destruction. It  denotes
forfeiture of material enjoyment in <i>svarga loka</i> or the heavenly planets  and
it also denotes the loss of spiritual accomplishments as  well,  both  which
an aspirant could have achieved. Destruction also  infers  the  intervention
of undesirable obstacles in the form of negative activities.  But  when  one
has performed even a little <i>yoga</i> in meditation one is automatically  insured
that there will be no diminution either in the present  or  in  the  future.
How this is so is answered next.
