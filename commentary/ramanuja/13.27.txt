Lord Krishna uses the word <i>akasam</i> which means ether and  denotes  space.  As
space prevails everywhere and encompasses all objects, yet by its  extremely
subtle nature the properties of any object are not able to influence,  taint
or modify it. In the same way the <i>atma</i> or  individual  immortal  soul  being
subatomic resides within the bodies of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings but  the
physical properties, attributes and qualities that pertain  to  such  bodies
be they demigods, human, animal, etc. are  unable  to  influence,  taint  or
modify it.
