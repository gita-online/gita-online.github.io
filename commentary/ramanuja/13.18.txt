One  must  intelligently  comprehends  the  nature   of   the   <i>purusah</i>   or
manifeatation  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material
substratum pervading physical existence and understand the three  components
of <i>prakriti</i> known as the <i>gunas</i> which are the modes of goodness, passion  and
ignorance which are inclusive of  everything  in  material  existence.  They
will be fully elaborated on in the next chapter. The word <i>sarvatha</i> means  in
any way or  condition  and  refers  to  whatever  physical  body  one  finds
themselves forced to accept whether demigod, human, demon, etc  due  to  the
dictate of <i>karma</i> or reactions to  actions.  <i>Na  sa  bhuya  abhijayate</i>  means
never takes birth again, never coerced to enter a womb again,  never  forced
to take a material form again. This means that  at  the  time  the  physical
body ceases to exist the <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul  will  be  realized  as  the
eternal essence of the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being and <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from
material existence  will  be  achieved  promoting  one  to  the  everlasting
spiritual worlds never again subject to birth and death.
