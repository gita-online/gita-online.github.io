Persons of this world are born into different castes with each caste  having
its own ordinances of conduct some injunctions  being  mandatory  and  other
injunctions being prohibitory. Even  if  a  member  of  a  particular  caste
transgresses the injunctions of that particular caste  they  deserve  to  be
accounted  for  as  praiseworthy  if  they  have  resolved   themselves   to
performing exclusive worship of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Such a  person  is
to be esteemed and honoured as  spiritually  enlightened  and  the  best  of
human  beings  equal  to  His  devotees  previously  mentioned.  It  may  be
questioned how can  this  be  possible  that  such  a  transgressor  of  the
injunctions of his caste can achieve this  position.  It  is  because  their
present conduct  and  resolution  are  definitively  focused  in  the  right
conclusion of unwavering <i>bhakti</i> or loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord.
Such a fixed state of  mind  consists  of  the  implicit  understanding  not
available to everyone that Lord Krishna solely is  cause  of  all  creation,
that Lord Krishna alone is the  source  of  infinite  universes,  that  Lord
Krishna Himself  is  the  ultimate  controller  of  everything  movable  and
stationary. That Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord of  all  and  is  also  my
teacher, my friend, my sole object of supreme  delight.  A  person  thinking
like this is always situated in righteousness. Such a person  is  always  to
be honoured and should not be disregarded due to any dereliction of duty  or
deviation from the dictates of his caste. To the contrary  because  all  his
attention and energies are  focused  in  propitiation  and  worship  of  the
Supreme Lord such a person is to be even more respected  and  honoured.  But
if there is  still  any  objections  that  by  transgressing  the  customary
injunctions  and  ordinances  of  one's  caste  must  cause  obstacles   and
impediments for developing <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  soul  and
taking one further away from  the  Supreme  Lord  as  stated  in  the  Vedic
scriptures that such a person shall not attain  the  Supreme  Lord  if  they
have not ceased from unrighteousness, who is not free  from  passion,  whose
mind is not under control and  whose  senses  are  unbridled  even  if  such
persons possess knowledge of the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence.
