The wonderous  and  amazing  recitation  of  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  by  Lord
Krishna directly heard and seen by Sanjaya by  clairaudience  and  celestial
vision sanctified and rejuvenated him. Reminiscing on this divine  discourse
over and over again he became increasingly ecstatic and thrilled.
