Those who prepare food from funds honestly acquired with the sole  objective
of worshipping the Supreme Lord Krishna  who  resides  as  the  soul  within
themselves as well as within all the demi-gods and every living entity;  and
those who only partake of such duly consecrated food become absolved of  all
sins  accumulated  over  iniquity  subatomic  and   atomic   impending   the
completion and fulfilment of self realisation  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul.  But
those sinful wretches who do not first offer to the Supreme  Lord  what  was
gifted to  them  and  instead  prepare  and  eat  it  appropriating  it  for
theirselves verily eat only sin. The word <i>agham</i> meaning  sin  denotes  their
will be grave consequences for such sins. Ignorant  of  the  path  to  <i>atma-</i>
<i>tattva</i> or self realisation of the soul, such  degraded  persons  perpetually
eat sinful food insuring a  hellish  destination  in  their  next  life.  It
should be understood that everything is connected to  <i>yagna</i>  or  worship  in
this world and the next, from both the point of  view  of  <i>sastra</i>  or  Vedic
scripture and from inference. It should also be clearly understood that  the
observance of <i>yagna</i> is essential for benefit and welfare of all mankind  and
that its omission purposefully or accidental is counter productive  for  the
entire human race and is fraught with sinfulness and dire consequences.
