All beings movable and  immovable  enter  into  the  Supreme  Lord  external
nature  know  as  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  transitory  material  substratum  which
identifies  with   <i>tamas</i>   or   nescience   which   is   the   non-sentient,
undifferentiated vast expanse of mass matter in its indistinct state  having
no name, no form and no consciousness. The words <i>kalpa-ksaye</i>  means  at  the
time time of universal dissolution being the end of a  <i>maha-kalpa</i>  which  is
the conclusion of Brahma's lifetime whereby  one  of  his  years  equals  26
trillion, 439 billion and 400 million human years and his  lifetime  is  100
of such years. At this time all  living  entities  are  dissolved  into  the
<i>prakriti</i> of Lord Krishna by His will alone and subsequently at the  dawn  of
the next <i>kalpa</i> all living entities are projected  out  of  the  darkness  by
Lord Krishna to continue  their  <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  from  their  previous
actions exactly where they left off. Lord Krishna is willing to produce  all
the living entities from His own transcendental body. The  Vedic  scriptures
declare: Of whom <i>avyakta</i> or imperceptible  energy  is  His  spiritual  body.
<i>Avyakta</i> merges into <i>aksara</i> or indestructible and <i>aksara</i>  merges  into  <i>tamas</i>
darkness.
Manu Samhita I.VIII beginning <i>se bhidyaya sarat svat aprakritam</i>  meaning  it
was  darkness  in  the  beginning  and  by  darkness  all  was  hidden   and
indiscernible.
