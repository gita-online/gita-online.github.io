To those who are situated in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of  goodness,  foods  that
are of the nature of <i>sattva</i> or goodness such as  milk,  fruits,  grains  and
vegetables are very dear. Such foods promote  long  life,  invigorating  the
body and elevating  the  mind  in  its  function  of  intelligence.  As  was
confirmed earlier in chapter XIV verse XVII:  From  the  quality  of  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> knowledge arises<i>.</i>  <i>Sattva  guna</i>  facilitates  spiritual  knowledge  and
likewise food that is <i>sattva</i>  also  facilitates  spiritual  intelligence  as
well as good health, strength, happiness and relish. The word <i>sukla</i>  meaning
happiness refers to the pleasure experienced while ingesting  the  food  and
afterwards when it is digesting and assimilating within the body.  The  word
<i>priti</i> means satisfaction that is derived  from  the  intake  of  pure  foods
inspiring congenial interest  in  spiritual  activities.  The  word  <i>rasayam</i>
means succulent, delectable. <i>Snigdhah</i> means  oleaginous,  unctuous.  <i>Sthirah</i>
means nourishing, sustaining. <i>Hrydha</i> means agreeable,  pleasing.  These  are
the qualities of <i>sattva</i> foods which are very much appreciated  by  those  in
<i>sattva guna.</i>  
<p>
Foods that are acidic, bitter, salty, sour, spicy,  pungent,  dry,  hard  or
burning are the foods that those in <i>raja guna</i> are very  much  attracted  to.
The word <i>tiksna</i> refers to food of no value because they are either  to  cold
or to hot. <i>Raksa</i> are foods which are to dry and hard. <i>Vidhahinah</i>  are  those
foods that cause a burning sensation in the body. These foods produce  pain,
distress, sickness and misery and decreases longevity of life  and  increase
desires for more and more <i>rajas</i> or passion.
<p>
The foods liked by those in <i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance  are  <i>yata-yaman</i>
meaning stale, foods that are old from the previous day, foods  cooked  more
than a <i>yama</i> which is literally three hours before.  <i>Gata-rasam</i>  means  those
foods which have lost their original  flavour  and  have  become  tasteless.
<i>Puti</i> means putrid, possessing a foul  smell.  <i>Paryusitam</i>  means  decomposed,
unrecognisable. <i>Ucchistam</i> means eating the  remains  of  others  food  after
they  have  eaten.  This  does  not  apply  to  honouring  the  remnants  of
<i>mahaprasadam</i> or sanctified food first  offered  to  Lord  Krishna  and  then
eaten by the spiritual preceptors  who  mercifully  leaves  some  for  their
devotees which is then glorified by  them  as  <i>maha  mahaprasadam</i>.  <i>Amedhyam</i>
means unsanctified foods  due  to  not  having  been  consecrated  by  first
offering it to the Supreme Lord and thus impure. Partaking of foods in  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna</i> such as meat,  fish,  fowl,  eggs,  wine,  alcohol,  etc.  breeds  dark
nescience and great ignorance.
<p>
So in conclusion those fortunate <i>jivas</i> or  embodied  beings  with  spiritual
insight should absolve themselves from the intake  of  foods  in  <i>raja  guna</i>
and <i>tama guna</i> and resort exclusively to foods in <i>sattva guna.</i>
