Lord Krishna gives the  analogy  of  a  turtle  which  withdraws  its  limbs
inside. Similarly when one is  able  to  keep  their  senses  from  pursuing
sensual objects of mundane pleasure by withdrawing  the  senses  inside  and
who also consciously reflects upon the soul within, such a  one  is  <i>sthita-</i>
<i>prajna</i> situated in the perfect knowledge of transcendent meditation.   There
are four stages in developing  to  this  platform  each  of  which  develops
backwards from its preceding stage. The  difficulty  in  following  this  is
revealed by Lord Krishna in the next verse.
