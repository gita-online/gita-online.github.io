Worldly minded people are impelled by material motivations.  That  they  are
governed by the inclinations of such motivations is  what  Lord  Krishna  is
indicating here. These   inclinations  are  the  external  tendencies  which
impels one to desire  interaction  with  physical  objects  and  arise  from
subconscious influences resulting from reactions  of  sinful  activities  in
past life experiences. These  subconscious  influences  give  birth  to  new
cravings for sense gratification. These cravings and desires  divert  people
from true knowledge  concerning  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  although  this
knowledge has always been available. In  order  to  satisfy  their  material
cravings and desires most people resort to inferior formless and  impersonal
conceptions of god, which never reveal any knowledge of the eternal <i>atma</i>  or
soul within all sentient beings  nor  its  inherent  relationship  with  the
Supreme Lord. Others pray to the demigods for specific material  gains  such
as wealth and power and following  the  ritualistic  rules  and  regulations
place their faith in them. Still others of perverted natures  appease  dark,
demoniac forces; worshipping them for abominable things.
