Lord Krishna is instructing to behold His all encompassing,  all  sustaining
transcendental <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form in hundreds  of  thousands
of unique transcendental  manifestations.  The  word  <i>d?vy?ni</i>  means  divine
denoting non-material spiritual colours and forms never seen before.
