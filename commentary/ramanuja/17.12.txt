Lord Krishna states that what is known as austerity of  speech  is  <i>svadhaya</i>
or the recitation of Vedic mantras after first being duly initiated  by  the
Vaisnava spiritual master. Words which consist totally of truth yet  do  not
offend those spoken to and which are imbued with sweet  and  pleasing  words
that are inspiring and  beneficial  are  austerities  of  speech  in  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of goodness.
