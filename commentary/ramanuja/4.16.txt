Exactly what is the nature of <i>karma</i> or action as performed by the  aspirants
treading the path to <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material  existence  and  what
also is <i>akarma</i> or inaction? By the term <i>akarma</i> is  inferred  true  knowledge
relating to the doer which is the <i>atma</i> or soul. What  is  the  action  which
needs to be performed and what is the wisdom of inaction  that  is  involved
in such  an  action?  Even  persons  of  discrimination  and  knowledge  are
bewildered in this matter and confused do not  understand  this  differences
properly.  Lord  Krishna  now  promises  to  dispel  all  delusion  in   the
intricacies of this subject. What is the purpose of performing actions as  a
matter of duty? The satisfaction consists in the knowledge  of  knowing  why
the duty is to be discharged.  The knower is the person who  performs  works
aspiring for <i>moksa.</i>  The  ignorant  is  one  who  performs  work  for  sense
gratification. The former performs work  without  egoism  while  the  latter
performs works full of egoissm. The former is eligible  for  liberation  the
latter is eligible for bondage. Why this is so difficult  to  understand  is
explained in the next verse.
