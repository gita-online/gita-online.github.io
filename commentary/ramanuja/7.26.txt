Lord Krishna reveals that He knows the destiny of all living beings and
this includes their past existence, their present existence and there
future existence. This confirms His omniscient and magnanimous nature that
all movable and immovable sentient beings throughout creation are
continuously objects of His loving concern in the past, present and future;
yet who discerns Him as Vasudeva the cause of all causes, the Supreme Lord
incarnate, always ready to give swift refuge and protection from all
calamities and difficulties to one who may seek or call out for Him. Thus
such a spiritually mature and evolved, enlightened sage is very rare and
the reason why Lord Krishna gives next.
