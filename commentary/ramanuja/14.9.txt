The cardinal features of  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  <i>sattva</i>  or  goodness<i>,</i>
<i>rajas</i> or passion and <i>tamas</i> or nescience are now  being  delineated  by  Lord
Krishna. The main quality of <i>sattva</i> is its ability  to  confer  blessedness.
The main proponent of <i>rajas</i> is that it impels  vigourous  activity  and  the
dominant  factor  in  <i>tamas</i>  is  that  it  obscures  intelligence  giving  a
perverted  view  of  reality  which  results  in  the  tendency  to  perform
unnatural activities. The three <i>gunas</i> are the natural  effects  of  <i>prakriti</i>
or the material substratum pervading physical existence and  constitute  the
qualities of all matter which manifests into physical bodies both gross  and
subtle. How they each give rise to consequences so radically  different  and
conflicting with each other is answered in the next verse.
