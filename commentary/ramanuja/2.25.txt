The word <i>avyaktah</i> means invisible  or  imperceivable  this  is  because  the
eternal soul being totally transcendental to the material  existence  cannot
be practically  examined  as  can  objects  which  possess  qualities  of  a
physical nature.
<p>
The  word  <i>acintyah</i>  means  inconceivable  because  the  eternal   soul   is
impossible to perceive by the  mind  and  the  senses  being  in  every  way
transcendental to the material substratum which is  what  the  consciousness
of the living  entities  base  their  understanding  on.  The  eternal  soul
differs  from  all  other  existences  and  levels  of   existence   is   in
transcendence. Therefore it is <i>avikaryah</i>  unchangeable  and  immutable.  The
Supreme Lord Krishna instructs that  by  knowing  the  eternal  soul  to  be
immortal there is no cause for grief.
