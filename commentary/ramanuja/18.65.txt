Lord Krishna affirms that there has never been in the  past  a  human  being
out of all humanity who was more  dear  to  Him  then  one  who  promulgates
Srimad Bhagavad-Gita to His devotees; nor will they ever be  one  dearer  to
Him in the future. <i>Priya-krttamah</i> means pleases more by their actions.  This
extolling of the qualities of His exalted  servitor  is  to  illustrate  the
immense divide between the devotees of the Supreme Lord and  those  who  are
not devotees of the Supreme Lord.
