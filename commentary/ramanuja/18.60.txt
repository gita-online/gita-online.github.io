Among the three paths mentioned  in  the  previous  verse:  <i>bhakti  yoga</i>  or
facilitating communion by exclusive loving devotion unto  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna or any of His authorised  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and  expansions
according to Vedic scriptures  is  considered  the  most  exalted  and  pre-
eminent and thus it is  the  most  confidential.  Because  Lord  Krishna  is
extremely affectionate to His devotees who have  Him  alone  as  their  sole
refuge, He will mercifully reveal  in  the  next  two  verses  the  absolute
conclusion and final essence  of  the  entire  divine  discourse  of  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita.
