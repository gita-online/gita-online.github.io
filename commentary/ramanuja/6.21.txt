Lord Krishna is explaining  that  whither  ever  so  ever  the  fickle  mind
flutters and flickers about to wander in infatuation away from the  <i>atma</i>  or
soul in pursuit of the objects of the senses, let all  efforts  be  made  to
withdraw the mind therefrom and guide it back   persuading  it  convincingly
the fact that the <i>atma</i> itself is the supreme goal of happiness.
