Lord Krishna concludes chapter two by revealing the state  of  consciousness
achieved by one who performs all actions unattached and equipoised based  on
knowledge of the eternal nature of the immortal soul. This process  has  for
its goal the attainment of transcendent meditation. It  is  <i>brahmi</i>  or  that
which leads to <i>brahma</i> the ultimate truth. Knowing the philosophy of  actions
are like this, one will no longer be subject to bewilderment  and  delusion.
The  results  of  this  are  one  will  no  longer  be  compelled  to  enter
<i>samsara</i> the endless cycle of birth and  death  in  the  mirage  of  material
existence. If one begins this process with determination  even  in  old  age
one will have the opportunity  to  attain  cognition  of  the  eternal  soul
within and <i>brahma-nirvana</i>  final liberation from the material existence.
<p>
Thus in this second chapter one who is not  knowledgeable  about  the  exact
nature of the soul, or how by performing ones prescribed  duties  unattached
can lead to liberation, or how by the misconception of  identifying  oneself
as the physical body one will not  be  properly  situated  and  how  by  the
process of <i>sankhya</i> in <i>jnana-yoga</i>  teaching  the  knowledge  of  the  eternal
nature of the soul as well as in <i>karma-yoga</i> performing all  activities  with
unattachment  leads  one  to  the  consciousness   state   of   transcendent
meditation.
<p>
The following doctrine is what is summarised in chapter two:
1) That the immortal soul is eternal.
2) All activities should be performed as a matter of duty devoid  of  desire
for reward.
3)  One  who  is  spiritually  intelligent  of   illuminated   consciousness
understands that  through  either  <i>jnana-yoga</i>  or  <i>karma-yoga</i>  the  goal  of
transcendent meditation can be attained.
<p>
These three spiritual truths have been revealed in  the  second  chapter  of
the Bhagavad-Gita for curing ignorance and dispelling delusion.
