One should know that this spiritual knowledge relative to the atma or soul
propounded by Lord Krishna to be imperishable. One should learn this well
and advance themselves along the path by diligently acquiring wisdom and
more by submissively approaching realised beings who have realised the
ultimate truth. One should render sincere, dedicated service to them with
veneration and humility asking relevant questions about the ultimate truth.
These being so advanced in atma tattva or soul realisation have experienced
the ultimate reality and being pleased by one's humble demeanour and
reverent questions will bless one with divine knowledge which they possess
and will impart the transcendental knowledge one is so eager and
enthusiastic to learn. If one has not practically realised there atma which
is an act of actual perception and situates one in their true nature then
such talk about it is merely a hypothesis.
