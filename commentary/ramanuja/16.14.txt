Wherever the demoniac may chance to take birth, these vile,  evil,  degraded
living entities who blaspheme and spite the Supreme Lord are kept  revolving
in <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of birth and death and  flung  into  lower
and more degraded forms of life. Since the demoniac adamantly desire  to  be
irreversibly opposed to the Supreme Lords Krishna's divine will, He  permits
them to pursue their wishes and they are hurled into  demoniac  wombs  birth
after birth in order that their aversion to Him will be increased.  Impelled
by the Supreme Lord's sanction their desires are satisfied and they  receive
the opportunity in a suitable demoniac environment to  exercise  their  free
will and voraciously vent their vile, evil and degraded nature.
