Deliverance from old age, disease and death signifies the disenchantment
and disjunction from material desires and connections by achieving atma
tattva or realisation of the soul and  comprehending its distinctness from
physicality replacing it with spiritual knowledge and connections. Those
who seek and worship the Supreme Lord Krishna with this objective have to
understand what brahman or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence
which refers to the arttas or aspirants in verse 16. Have to know what
adhyatmam or the individual souls which refers to the jijnasur or soul
seekers in verse 16 and must know karma cakhilam or the different kinds of
fruitive actions with their subsequent reactions this refers to the jnani
or seeker of spiritual knowledge in verse 16.
