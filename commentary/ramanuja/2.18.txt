The term <i>deha</i> meaning body is derived from the word <i>dih</i> meaning to  increase
and correspondingly those bodies having increase  must  also  have  decrease
and therefore are of a perishable nature. The elements combine to  form  the
body dictated by <i>karma</i> ato  render  service  to  the  imperishable  soul  to
enable the living entity to experience the positive and negative  fruits  of
their actions. In the Brihad- aranyaka Upanisad it is stated:  <i>by  accruring</i>
<i>merit one becomes meritorious.</i> A living entity is forced to  accept  a  body
only until all ones positive and negative <i>karma</i> is exhausted  and  then  the
physical body is no longer bound to exist in the physical plane.
<p>
As for the  soul  it  is  indestructible,  it  is  imperishable  and  it  is
inconceivable. As the aggregate of all facets of consciousness the  soul  is
the subject and all individual facets of consciousness are the  object.  All
pervading throughout the body  of  every  living  entity  the  soul  as  the
cogniser  is perceived by its unique  distinction  of  being  transcendental
from the body. Nor can the soul be perceived as of a mutable  nature  as  in
the case of the senses. Thus by the fact of its all pervading nature  it  is
verified that the soul is not  something  which  can  increase  or  decrease
because of or due to aggregation. By reason of  its  all  pervasiveness  the
factual reality of the souls eternality is apparent.
<p>
As regarding the body because  it  is  subject  to  decrease  and  increase,
because it is for the felicitation of the embodied soul in the  experiencing
the results of <i>karma,</i> because it is of multiforms and because it is  subject
to decay it is destructible.
<p>
So it can be clearly seen that because the body is of  a  perishable  nature
and because the soul is of an eternal nature neither of the two can be  just
reason for regret. Therefore the Supreme Lord instructs Arjuna to bear  with
fortitude the unavoidable sharp contact of  piercing  arrows  upon  him  and
upon  others and thus going to battle as  a  matter  of  duty,  without  the
desire for any results, prepare his way for immortality.
