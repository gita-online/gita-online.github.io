The word <i>atmana</i> refers to the mind. The mind must  detach  itself  from  the
infatuation of sense  objects  by  association  from  those  wise  in  Vedic
knowledge who posess spiritual knowledge. In  this  way  the  mind  will  be
elevated and gravitate towards spiritual objectives.  But  if  the  mind  is
pointed in the reverse direction subject to worldly pursuits and deluded  by
sense objects then the mind will become agitated and harassed. Lord  Krishna
is confirming the truth that the mind has the potential  to  give  the  most
benefit as the greatest friend to the <i>atma</i> or eternal  soul  and  also  that
the mind has the potential to be the most destructive as the greatest  enemy
to the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul depending upon how the mind is influenced.
