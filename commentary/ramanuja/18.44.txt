It is natural that those spiritually intelligent human  beings  who  worship
the source of their very existence,  Lord  Krishna  who  is  the  root,  the
foundation from whence all creation originates and by whom all existence  is
pervaded will certainly receive His grace  and  achieve  the  perfection  of
self-realisation. The Supreme Lord's position has already  been  established
in chapter 7, verses 6 and 7 where Lord Krishna confirms: He  alone  is  the
origin of all as well as the demise of all. There  is  nothing  superior  to
Lord Krishna for all creation depends upon Him. In chapter  9,  verse  4  He
states: In an unperceivable manner He pervades all existence yet  everything
is in Him but He is not in it.  In chapter 9, verse 10 He states:  That  His
external energy manifests  all  moving  and  stationary  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings according to His direction and in chapter 10,  verse  8  He  reveals:
That every aspect of creation, maintenance and  existence  as  well  as  the
Vedic scriptures has Him alone as the sole source. Such examples are  unique
to Lord Krishna exclusively and unprecedented.
