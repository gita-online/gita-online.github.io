Although death is waiting patiently for  their  demise  at  any  moment;  to
carry them off to hellish worlds of great suffering; Lord  Krishna  explains
that the demoniac are  so  involved  in  the  deception  of  their  material
manipulations for planetary power and  control  of  planetary  wealth  which
they amass to the maximum that they become oblivious to the existence  of  a
higher reality. The demoniac are deceived  in  the  vastness  of  their  own
schemes and undertakings which consumes  all  of  their  time  as  they  are
constantly endeavouring to  keep  their  power  intact.  Simultaneously  the
demoniac are pursuing their lusts for sense gratification  with  full  power
imagining that it constitutes the apex of success as  the  highest  ambition
of all existence. The demoniac are so completely deluded that  they  believe
that enjoying the objects of the senses is the final goal of all  hopes  and
dreams with no conception  more  advanced  than  this.   In  this  way  they
deceive and fully shackle themselves in bondage by  the  illusion  of  their
own hopes and expectations which keeps them bound inexorably in perdition.
