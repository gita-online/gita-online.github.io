It is logically explained that even in the performance of  prescribed  Vedic
activities and obligatory duties one can exercise <i>tyaja</i> or  renunciation  in
its threefold composite. Abandonment of these is not required. First is  the
lowest stage likened unto  <i>tama  guna</i>  the  mode  of  ignorance  whereby  in
renunciation one performs activities as a matter of  duty  or  a  matter  of
righteousness without desire for rewards. This can  be  done  by  abandoning
desires  for  material  benefits  or  heavenly  delights.  Second   is   the
intermediate stage likened unto  <i>raja  guna</i>  the  mode  of  passion  whereby
renunciation of activities abandons the identifying ego  sense  attached  to
it. Relinquishing such mentalities as this work was accomplished  by  me,  I
did it, this is mine and the rewards  are  mine.  Thirdly  is  likened  unto
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness and is renunciation whereby one  surrenders
all rewards and results  unto  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations and expansions as revealed in Vedic scriptures.  One
should be cognizant that He is  the  supreme  absolute  truth,  the  supreme
controller  and  the  ultimate  reality  and  not  think  that  we  are  the
controllers in any way.
