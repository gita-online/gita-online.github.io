The process of meditating on Lord Krishna at the time of death is also  well
known to the  three stages of aspirants mentioned previously  being  <i>arthis,</i>
<i>jijnasur</i> and <i>jnanis.</i> One who when their life cycle has the Supreme  Lord  in
their constant remembrance at the moment of  departing  their  body  attains
the Supreme Lord. The word <i>mad bhavam</i> means like  unto  the  Supreme  Lord's
nature. Whatever nature of the Supreme Lord is vividly envisioned  in  one's
mind at the moment of death that nature one becomes without  fail.  Examples
are like the history of Jada Bharata and others who were  reborn  in  animal
forms. He was attached to a deer he  had  raised  after  seeing  its  mother
killed by a tiger and at the exact moment of death looking at this  deer  he
was concerned about its future welfare and hence in his  next  life  he  was
born as a deer due  to  this  last  impression  of  consciousness.  This  is
because the prominence  position  of  such  thoughts  and  images  in  one's
consciousness automatically direct and  transport  one  to  that  which  one
envisions. That reality that whatever ideas and images that are  present  in
one's mind in the very last thought before  death  is  what  one  absolutely
becomes  in their next life is further elucidated in the next verse.
