Lord Krishna now explains that when the mind  is  placid  and  pure  it  has
enacted for itself the cessation of all miseries  arising  from  conjunction
with <i>prakriti</i> materialism. <i>Prasanna-chetah</i> refers  to  that  delightful  one
whose mind is expunged of all impediments that  hinders  it  from  realising
the eternal soul while  bestowing  the  spiritual  intelligence  needed  for
illumination.  Thus  when  the  mind  has  been  purified  all   sorrow   is
terminated.
