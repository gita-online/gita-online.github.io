Lord Krishna is origin of Vishnu who is the origin  of  Brahma  who  is  the
origin of the Prajapatis who are the physical patriarchs of  all  creatures.
All the demigods and any other kind of god  find  their  source  in  Him  as
well. He is known  as  <i>Hiranyagarbha</i>  the  indwelling  soul  of  all  living
entities. Comprehending the reality of all  these  things  as  part  of  the
magnificently majestic pageant of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna with  joy  elated
heart and eyes brimming with tears  prostrated  himself  unto  Lord  Krishna
again and again from every side with trepidation.
