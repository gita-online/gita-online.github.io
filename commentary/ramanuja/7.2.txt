Lord Krishna  has  deigned  to  reveal  completely  in  detail  the  general
knowledge concerning Him as well as the  esoteric  knowledge  which  can  be
realised. The word <i>vijnana</i> means realised knowledge.  This  denotes  a  more
profound level of understanding with a special propensity  of  inate  wisdom
which can discern and discriminate the reality of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna
being the original substratum and foundation of  all  that  is  animate  and
inanimate in existence. He is the ultimate  controller,  the  antithesis  to
whatever is demoniac. He is the sovereign master of all creation  possessing
unlimited  divine  glories  and  infinite   transcendental   qualities   and
attributes. Along with revealing these things Lord Krishna will also  reveal
the wisdom concerning His manifested nature.  By  the  realisation  of  this
spiritual knowledge there will be nothing left  worthy  of  knowing  for  an
aspirant of <i>bhakti</i> or unconditional loving devotion. The extreme  difficulty
in acquiring  such  esoteric  knowledge  about  the  Supreme  Lord  will  be
explained in the following verse.
