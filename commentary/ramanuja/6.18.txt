Lord Krishna is revealing the superior meditation wherein  as  a  result  of
dedicated effort one completely  immerses  their  mind  in  the  delight  of
spiritual transcendence, wherein as the mind perceiving  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul
receives the  greatest  satisfaction  and  contentment  realising  there  is
nothing else to be desired for, wherein the consciousness  experiences  that
sublime and ineffable bliss beyond the scope of the  senses  to  comprehend,
wherein  once  established  one  never  for  a  moment  has  the  desire  to
relinquish  the  exquisite  bliss   experienced,   wherein   perfection   of
meditation is even once achieved one desires nothing else even in the  times
of  not  meditating,  and  wherein  once  established  whether  immersed  in
meditation or on the way  to  perfection  one  does  not  become  shaken  by
adversity or disturbed by afflictions even as grave and devastating  as  the
premature death of a beloved family member, One should learn  this  superior
meditation which severs all connection with sorrow and misery.  Knowing  the
intrinsic nature of meditation to be  thus  one  should  perform  meditation
with full trust and faith, free from all doubts  with  the  mind  happy  and
content.
