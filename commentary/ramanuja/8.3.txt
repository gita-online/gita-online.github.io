What is designated in verse one as  <i>tad  brahma</i>  or  the  supreme  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence is the <i>aksaram  paramam</i>  or  the  supreme
indestructible <i>atma</i> or soul.  <i>Aksaram</i> is that which is not subject to  decay
or imperishable and is the collective given by  the  <i>ksetrajnanis</i>  or  those
knowledgeable of the field of action or the informers of  uninformed  matter
and <i>atma</i>  embodied  beings.  The  Subala  Upanisad  II  states  <i>avyakta</i>  the
indiscernible compound of spirit and  matter  merges  into  the  <i>aksara</i>  the
indivisible compound which descends into <i>tamas</i> or nescience. <i>Parama  aksaram</i>
is the superior indestructible <i>atma</i> nature which  is  completely  disengaged
from <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum  and  not  connected  to  even  the
<i>aksaram</i>  which  comprises  embodied  beings  and  combines  both.  The  word
<i>svabhavo</i> is also called <i>adhyatma</i> and indicates subtle material elements  and
its accompanying erratic tendencies. These subtle elements are what  adheres
to the <i>atma</i> in the descent of  the  supra  subtle  quintuple  process  from
spirit to matter, the last being the fifth stage which becomes  the  seminal
fluids referred to in the <i>Panca-agni-vidva</i> or  five-fold  sacrificial  fires
which are described in the Chandogya  Upanisad:V.III-X  which  is  essential
and has to be known by all aspirants.  Both  <i>aksara</i>  and  <i>adhyatma</i>  must  be
realised by the <i>mumumkshus</i> or emancipation seekers for <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
from material existence as <i>aksara</i> the immortal soul is that what  is  worthy
of selection and <i>adhyatma</i> the  embodied  being  incarcerated  in  matter  is
worthy of rejection. The sequence which manifests this descent  into  matter
by the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being is called <i>visargah</i> and <i>karma</i>  refers  to  that
specific action which activates a corresponding reaction and determines  the
destination and manifestation of all creatures into embodied states  whether
human,  animal,  fish  etc.  The  final   action   which   actually   causes
manifestation into material existence is known as procreation between  males
and females of different species. The Vedic scriptures declare that  in  the
fifth stage the male discharges  the  sacrificial  water  into  the  females
sacrificial fire and a new embodied being is created. This act is  known  as
<i>karma.</i> The knowledge of <i>karma, aksara</i> and <i>adhyatma</i> are all prerequisites  of
knowledge absolutely essential for those seeking <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
the material existence. Otherwise one will be ignorant of what is worthy  of
rejection and what is worthy of attention and unable  to  properly  interact
accordingly. An example is following in verse 11 concerning  <i>brahmacarya</i>  or
celibacy.
