Lord Krishna is explaining that  one  whose  cravings  for  sensual  objects
linger, the effort to overcome the senses without focusing the mind  on  the
Supreme Lord is futile. This is due to the fact  that  without  the  Supreme
Lords grace the residue of past  sensual  activities  and  the  pleasure  or
frustration derived therefrom will delude the mind to pursue sense  objects.
This debilitating effect creates a magnetic attraction where the desire  for
sense objects becomes more and  more  extreme.  From   this  extreme  desire
springs <i>kama</i> lust. Lust is the next stage of desire. Lust is that which  one
feels when  they thinks that they cannot exist without  their  desire  being
gratified. From  lust  springs  <i>krodha</i>  anger.  <i>Krodha</i>  is  that  frustrated
outraged one feels against that which stands in the way  of  obtaining   the
gratification of ones senses. From <i>krodha</i> arises  <i>sammoha</i>  bewilderment  and
delusion which is the mental condition where one is no longer  cognisant  of
what action should be performed and what action  should  not  be  performed.
One will foolishly do anything in this condition. Thereafter comes  dementia
causing loss in memory of the process one began in order  to  constrain  the
senses and control the mind. From dementia comes loss of will power, one  no
longer  has  the  drive  and  incentive  to  cultivate  themselves   towards
obtaining spiritual realisation of the eternal soul. When this happens  then
one perishes their spiritual opportunity being drowned again  and  again  in
<i>samsara</i> the endless cycle of birth and death in the material existence.
