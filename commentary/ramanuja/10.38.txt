Lord Krishna reveals that His <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental opulence  is
infinite without end and to account for them all is impossible as  new  ones
are always manifesting. The ones that have been stated in this  chapter  are
those that have manifested somehow or other with some restrictions and  thus
only give a limited perception.
