Lord Krishna reveals that of the holy sages His <i>vibhuti</i> is Bhrigu. The  word
<i>giram</i> means articulate sound vibrations of these Lord Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  is
the all powerful monosyllable OM. Of all <i>yagna</i> or propitiation  and  worship
to  the  Supreme  Lord,  the  best  and  most  elevated  is  <i>japa-yagno</i>  the
reverential and devotional chanting of the Supreme Lord Krishna holy  names.
Of terrestrial mountains His <i>vibhuti</i> is the mighty Himalayas.
