Here Lord Krishna explains that the <i>buddhi</i> or intellect  of  those  situated
in <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion are  unable  to  discern  between  the  two
types of <i>dharma</i> or righteousness  given  in  the  previous  verse  or  their
opposite of <i>adharma</i> or unrighteousness which subjects one  to  inappropriate
actions according to time, place and circumstances.
