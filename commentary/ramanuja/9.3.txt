Lord Krishna uses the word <i>dharmasya</i> meaning acts of  eternal  righteousness
and is the sacred means to acquire <i>upasana</i> or  communion  with  the  Supreme
Lord. Its virtue is that it has the Supreme Lord as its  only  goal  and  is
very joyful and exhilarating to perform. It achieves for  the  aspirant  who
faithfully engages in it continuously the highest  result  as  it  bequeaths
direct realization of the Supreme Lord. The word <i>asraddadhanah</i>  means  those
devoid of faith. Whoever having the golden opportunity after thousands  upon
thousands of lifetimes to worship the Supreme Lord but are found lacking  in
determination and attention as well as fervent longing due  to  insufficient
faith, fail to reach Lord Krishna and instead are  forced  to  be  propelled
into the lethal current of <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of  birth  and  death
which is very terrible. Oh how dangerous and perilous is human existence!
