The word <i>prthaktvena</i> means separate individuality  alluding  to  differences
in appearance between  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  beings.  The  words  <i>nana-bhavan</i>
refers to plurality of substance in falsely surmising that the  <i>atma</i>  varies
in quality or quantity with the variance of the physical body  inhabited  by
the <i>jiva</i> or to wrongly conclude that the <i>atma</i> varies  in  size  and  potency
according to the body it is  in.  This  mentality  is  indicative  of  those
situated in <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion and  includes  those  desirous  of
receiving rewards for their actions.
