Here Arjuna is asserting that all Lord  Krishna  is  stating  is  absolutely
factual and not any metaphorical description. This  means  that  every  word
that Lord Krishna speaks is the absolute reality and His  extraordinary  and
infinite glories and illustrious qualities  and  phenomenal  attributes  are
always manifest and eternal. Thus Lord Krishna  is  known  as  <i>Bhagavan</i>  the
complete possessor of the six opulences: total power,  total  beauty,  total
wisdom, total wealth,  total fame and total renunciation. Neither the  <i>devah</i>
or demigods nor the <i>danavah</i> or demons being of  limited  understanding  have
the ability to understand Him and perceive His identity in full.
