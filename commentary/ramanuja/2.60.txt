Whosoever would wish to succeed in overcoming the dichotomous difficulty  by
the mutual inter-relating dependence of sense control and soul cognition  as
delineated previously, must certainly master the senses. Which due to  their
constant craving for pleasure are  extremely  troublesome  to  govern.  Lord
Krishna as the Supreme Lord is instructing to make Him the  sole  object  of
ones meditation and thus become established in undisturbed serenity  in  the
ultimate reality. When  our  minds  have  been  evolved  to  realising  Lord
Krishna as the supreme absolute reality all impurities  are  eradicated  and
the mind is purified and clear, free from all desires.  Now  at  this  stage
for the first time the mind is free from all desires. The  mind  along  with
the senses completely under control is then capable of  achieving  cognition
of the eternal soul. In  the  Vishnu  Purana  XI.VII.LXXIV  beginning  <i>yatha</i>
<i>adniruddhata-sikhah</i> it is written that as a blazing fire fanned  by  blowing
wind burns up dry wood; in the same way Lord Krishna enthroned in the  heart
burns up all sins of those who link their individual consciousness with  the
ultimate  consciousness  in  soul  cognition.  Spiritual   intelligence   is
confirmed in those whose senses are under control.  But  it  must  be  noted
that unless devotion has developed for the Supreme Lord  Krishna,  whosoever
attempts to master the senses by their own might and  self  effort  are  all
destined to failure.
