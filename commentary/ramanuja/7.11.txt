Lord Krishna declares that all  these  things  of  distinguishing  qualities
manifest from Himself only and not from any other. All things are His  parts
and parcels and constitute His body. Hence all things are always in Him  and
He is always in all things. He is the sole existing reality and  all  things
are completely dependent upon  Him.  Next  we  will  see  things  viewed  in
another way.
