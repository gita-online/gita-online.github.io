Previously a concise description of what is to be known as constituting  the
<i>ksetra</i> or field of activity has been given  by  Lord  Krishna  beginning  in
verse six with <i>maha-bhutani</i>    meaning  the  five  fundamental  elements  of
material nature and in verses 8 through  12  beginning  with  <i>amanivitam</i>  or
reverence the 20 excellent are enumerated as the  means  for  acquiring  the
knowledge of <i>atma-tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation  up  to  perception  of  the
eternal spiritual reality,  knowing  the  Supreme  Lord  reside  within  the
etheric heart of all living beings. Here  Lord  Krishna  states  <i>mad  bhakta</i>
meaning His devotees are knowledgeable of the reality regarding the  <i>ksetra,</i>
knowledgeable of the means by which to realise the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul
which is of the nature of <i>ksetra-jna</i> or knower of  the  sphere  of  activity
and distinctly different from  the  <i>ksetra.</i>  Only  His  devotees  are  those
situated in such knowledge and <i>mad  bhavayopapadyate</i>  meaning  qualified  to
attain exclusive loving devotion to Him which  is  everlasting  and  eternal
and which is different from <i>samsara</i> or the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and
death. Next Lord Krishna will explain the  beginingless  state  of  the  two
distinct natural verities of matter and  soul  conjoined  together  and  the
different functions each is engendered to perform as well as how  these  two
verities came to be situated in this condition.
