So from this verse it can be understood that not by only  comprehending  the
relationship between matter and spirit, the physical body and  the  soul  in
meditation does one achieve the desired  goal.  For  can  one  surmount  the
three <i>gunas</i> by mere reflection and contemplation which is always  liable  to
be violated by the obstacles of old habits inimical  to  them  by  the  mind
which has been contracted out in service to them for countless lifetimes.

<i>Mam</i>=unto Me the infallibly willed,  the  infinitely  loving,  the  ocean  of
mercy to His devotees.
<i>Avyabhicharena</i>  means  without  adulteration,  interruption  or   error   in
exclusive devotion
<i>Bhakti yoga</i> means communion with the Supreme  Lord  through  intense  loving
emotions
Only the devotee of <i>bhakti yoga</i> will be  able  to  surmount  the  <i>gunas</i>  and
attain Lord Krishna
<i>Brahma bhuyaya</i>  =  <i>Brahma  bhavaya</i>  or  eligibility  and  qualification  for
realisingthe <i>brahman</i>
The <i>brahman</i> is the spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence.  Although
it is eternal and imperishable it is  only  the  impersonal  aspect  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna manifesting from  the  effulgence  emanating  from  His
inconceivable spiritual form. It also contains elements  of  the  nature  of
the  <i>atma</i>  or  the  localised  immortal  soul  as  well  as  <i>paramatma</i>   the
omnipresent Supreme Soul within the etheric heart of all sentient beings  in
all dimensions and manifestations of creation in existence.
