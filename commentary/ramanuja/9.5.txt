Lord Krishna states unequivocally <i>na bhuta-stah</i> meaning  that  He  does  not
derives any  support  whatsoever  from  the  myriads  of  unlimited  created
sentient  and  insentient  beings.  He  is  supremely  independent  and   He
specifically states that He is not upheld by them in any  manner  like  that
of a vessel upholding water. It is by His will alone that  He  supports  and
energises all existence. Just marvel on the wonder of His <i>yoga  aisvaram</i>  or
divine supernatural power which is so fantastic  and  phenomenal  and  which
there is no comparison in any form any where else in the  past,  present  or
future. What is this divine, supernatural power which is so mysterious  that
it controls, organises and directs all of creation with natural  perfection.
The word <i>mamatma</i> means by His own soul being for Him <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme
Soul residing in all beings and this opulent of  abundance  constitutes  the
power of His will which alone is the cause of all existence. So He is <i>bhuta-</i>
<i>bhrt</i> or the support of all existence and <i>bhuta-bhavanah</i>  the  protector  of
existence or that by which an order of  existence  is  established.  In  the
next verse an example will be given to emphasise how all things depend  upon
Lord Krishna's will for their existence.
