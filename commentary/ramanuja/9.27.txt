Whatever mundane requirements according to <i>varnasrama</i> or class and  position
in society one may be engaged in out of necessity to  maintain  one's  life.
Whatever vegetarian food  one  may  be  eating  and  whatever  non-alcoholic
beverages one may be  drinking.  Whatever  daily  and  occasional  Vedically
enjoined duties one may  be  fulfilling  such  as  <i>juhosi</i>  or  offerings  in
rituals, <i>dadasi</i> is giving in charity, <i>tapasyasi</i> is austerities or  vows  all
should be offered  internally  to  the  Supreme  Lord.  Everything  that  is
intended, dedicated  and  delivered  unto  the  Supreme  Lord  is  known  as
<i>arpanam</i> an offering to Him. One should perform  all  activities  in  such  a
sublime way as the performer of the action, the enjoyer of  the  action  are
actually part of the worship  offered  unto  the  Supreme  Lord.  The  exact
understanding is that in all actions constituting rituals  of  demigods  and
lesser gods there  are  limitations  in  scope  and  power.  The  individual
performs such ritual and is  the  enjoyer  of  its  rewards;  but  both  the
performer and the demigods as well as lesser gods are all  part  and  parcel
of the Supreme Lord Krishna and are sustained and maintained by  Him  alone.
As He is the sole support of everything in creation they are  all  dependent
upon Him for all their impulses and for their complete existence.
<p>
The Supreme Lord Krishna  is  the  absolute  controller  ,  the  independent
indwelling monitor, the  performer  of  the  worship,  the  enjoyer  of  the
worship and the object of worship. He is all the hosts of demigods  and  all
lesser gods. He is the  sum  total  of  all  acts  constituting  worship  in
accordance to the Vedic scriptures and He is the recipient of them as  well.
One should fashion the intention of their mode of meditation on the  Supreme
Lord Krishna or any of His Vedically authorized incarnations  or  expansions
in the mood of <i>bhakti</i> or loving   devotional  communion  with  the  absolute
understanding that He is the source of everything, He comprises  everything,
and everything emanates from Him as His part and parcel.
