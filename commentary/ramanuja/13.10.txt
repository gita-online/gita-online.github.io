The word <i>bahih</i> means outside, this refers  to  the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul
which still exists even when  it  departs  a  physical  body  at  death  and
abandons the subtle body along with  the  five  elements  of  earth,  water,
fire, air and ether  although  it  is  present  within  them  as  well.   As
confirmed  in  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.VII.VII  beginning  <i>sa  ya  esho</i>
<i>animaitad</i>  means:  The  source  of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual   substratum
pervading all existence is  <i>Parabrahma</i>  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  who  is
eternally existing in everything by His transcendental  potency.  By  nature
it is <i>acaram</i> or stationary and unmoving but it is <i>caram</i>  or  moving  in  its
embodied  state.  Due  to  being  supra-subtle  without  material,   mundane
qualities it is <i>avijneyam</i> or incomprehensible. The  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul
possesses all powers and knowledge  although  it  occupies  and  inhabits  a
bodily  form.  Because  it  is  subatomic  it  can  not  be   perceived   by
technological methods and remains  a  mystery.  Therefore  it  is  extremely
difficult for worldly people of logic and  reason  to  understand  it  being
separate and distinct from the physical body. The  words  <i>durastham  cantike</i>
<i>ca tat</i> means that the <i>atma</i> although present within their own bodies is  very
far away from those who are arrogant, ostentatious, irreverent, etc. who  do
not possesses the 20 virtues of righteousness given in verses 8 to  12  such
as humility, reverence and nonviolence. But contrarily it is extremely  near
to those dear ones who possess the 20 virtues.  This  is  because  these  20
virtues facilitate a living entities  ability  to  perceive  internally  and
realize the <i>atma.</i>
