The Supreme Lord Krishna considering Arjuna to be of a divine nature  and  a
worthy recepient revealed the revelation of His aspect  of  <i>Purusottama</i>  the
absolute Supreme Being which  is the confidential  secret  of  all  secrets.
One  who  knows  this  shall  become  perpetually  spiritually  enlightened;
acquiring all the attributes and wisdom by  which  one  aspiring  to  attain
Lord Krishna will possess. Such a one will have accomplished all  works  and
duties and the result of every activity needed to  attain  Lord  Krishna  by
renunciation and penance will in fact be acquired.
<p>
This chapter which gives complete knowledge of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's
aspect of <i>Purusottama</i> that has been substantiated by  the  Vedic  scriptures
is alone sufficient to to accomplish what is  stated  in  this  verse.  That
this  spiritual  knowledge  in  itself  is  enough  to  manifest   spiritual
enlightenment and all that arises from  it  without  having  direct  contact
with the Supreme Being known as <i>Purusottama</i> as that  is  not  a  requirement
for success.

Chapter 15 has clearly delineated  an  explicit  explanation  of  the  three
fundamentals of all existence which are <i>Isvara</i>  the  Supreme  Lord,  <i>cit</i>  or
sentient  consciousness  and  <i>achit</i>  or  insentient  matter  which  combined
delivers a complete comprehensive solution to the  meaning  and  mystery  of
existence throughout  creation.  This  is  the  ontological  thesis  of  Sri
Ramanuja's qualified monism philosophy of <i>Visisthadvaita-veda</i>  which  states
that although all the energies of the Supreme Lord are one they each  retain
their individuality.
