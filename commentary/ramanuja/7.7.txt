Lord Krishna is revealing the essence of  reality  by  stating  <i>mayi  sarvam</i>
<i>idam</i> meaning everything  there  is  being  either  <i>chit</i>  sentient  or  <i>achit</i>
insentient, everythinthat exists as the aggregate of causes and effects  are
constituted from Him as  He  is  the  original  source  of  all.  Absolutely
everything depends upon Lord Krishna for their existence and maintenance  as
the physical body depends upon the <i>atma</i> or  soul  for  its  existence.  Lord
Krishna is <i>Paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul residing in all  living  entities  and
thus everything in creation are all infinitesimal parts and parcels of   Him
in the way that unlimited jewels are held together by means of a string.  In
the Antaryami Brahmana and other Upanisads the coexistence  of  <i>prakriti</i>  or
the material substratum and the <i>Brahman</i> the spiritual  substratum  pervading
all existence is compared to the relationship of the physical body  and  the
<i>atma</i> or soul. To whom material existence and all beings constitute His  body
and within all beings He is the supreme <i>atma,</i> He is  the  Divine  Lord,  one
without a second, Lord Krishna. Thus all things exist as part  of  His  body
and are ensouled by Him as well. Hence all things are  predicative  to,  and
modes of the Supreme Lord, who solely  manifested  all  existence  which  is
completely subsequent to Him. All terms are thus connotations of Him by  the
rule of <i>samanadhikaranya</i> which  expresses  the  inseparable  and  invariable
relationship of coexistence manifesting  between  substance  and  attribute.
This can easily be  understood  by  comprehending  that  any  term  used  to
address an attribute of the Supreme Lord  is  directly  connotative  to  the
source from where the attribute  originates,  being  the  Supreme  Lord.  In
regards to the communal relationship of substance  and  attribute  referring
to the dual indissoluble nature manifesting together, the next  four  verses
further elucidate.
