Lord Krishna explains that when the particular activities of  the  adept  of
spiritual  intelligence  are  described   then   the   characteristics   are
recognised. Because one with spiritual intelligence focus their mind  to  be
fully immersed solely in the soul, they are known as being  soul  satisfied.
When such a one is so absorbed in the soul that all  other  desires  abiding
therein are completely banished then such a one is known  as  <i>sthita-prajnah</i>
situated in transcendent consciousness. This is the  paramount  platform  of
spiritual intelligence in the mind. After this the next  lower  intermediate
stage will be defined.
