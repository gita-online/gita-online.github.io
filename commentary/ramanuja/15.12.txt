The word <i>gam</i> means earth and  denotes  the  Earth.   The  word  <i>ojasa</i>  means
indomitable potency. Lord Krishna enters into every atom  of  the  Earth  by
this potency and supports  all  mobile  and  stationary  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings by this potency. He also manifests  the  energy  of  the  moon  whose
nature is ambrosial and which nourishes all plants, vegetables,  fruits  and
herbs, yielding  crops such as rice and grains.
