Stopping all activities of the external senses prepares one to qualify for
practising meditation. Sitting in an erect posture, focusing the eyes half
closed between the eyebrows or the tip of the nose, equalising the breath
until suspended rendering the mind and sense incapable of moving to any
other location except to the atma or soul. Due to fulfilling the above
meditation one is automatically freed from desire, fear and doubts. Whose
sole goal and aim is moksa or liberation. Determinedly intent on achieving
atma tattva or soul realisation such a person is considered to be liberated
even before fully accomplishing the goal as it is a certainty it will be
achieved. The ease which this karma yoga or selfless performance of
prescribed Vedic activities with its nitya or daily duties and its
naimitika or occasional duities having yoga or the science of the
individual consciousness attaining communion with the ultimate
consciousness will next be revealed.
