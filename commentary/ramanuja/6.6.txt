<p><div align=justify>The mind is only a friend to those who are able to restrain it from  flowing
externally outwards after sense objects; but if one is unable to subdue  the
mind that it will harass and aggravate one to satisfy the senses and is  the
worst enemy. Lord Krishna is conveying that an ungoverned  and  uncontrolled
mind being attached  to  sense  gratification  interposes  obstructions  and
deviations in the way which deviates and  hinders  one  from  attainment  of
<i>atma tatva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  soul.  Sage  Parasara  the  father  of
Vedavyasa has stated that the mind itself is the sole cause  of  bondage  in
the material existence as well as the sole  cause  of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
from the material  existence.  A  mind  infatuated  with  desire  for  sense
objects constitutes a state of bondage and a mind free from the delusion  of
desire for sense objects constitutes  the  way  to  <i>moksa.</i>  The  preliminary
competency to be acquired before one commences meditation will be  given  in
the next verse.
