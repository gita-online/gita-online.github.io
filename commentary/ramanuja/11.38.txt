Lord Krishna is being addressed thusly: O' infinite energy,  the  embodiment
of everything, thy glory is beyond measure.  As  <i>paramatma</i>  or  the  Supreme
soul He enters and resides in all beings. Thus He is  the  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal
soul within all the unlimited multitudes of intelligent and  non-intelligent
living entities. All <i>atmas</i> are of the same eternal quality and  essence  and
all together constitute the divine, transcendental body of the Supreme  Lord
Krishna. Thus Lord Krishna is the  root  source  from  which  everything  is
manifested and all things are a part of Him and all  names  are  a  name  of
Him. It is  clearly  apparent  that  the  immanent  nature  and  omnipresent
characteristics  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  are  the  basis  for   the
descriptions of His glory given in the previous three verses such as  He  is
<i>asat</i> the cause and <i>sat</i> the effect as well as  <i>tatam  visvam  ananta-rupa</i>  of
unlimited forms pervading all creation and references to His being  all  the
demigods  like  Brahma,  Yama,   Vayuh   etc.   Thus   does   Lord   Krishna
interpenetrate all existence.
