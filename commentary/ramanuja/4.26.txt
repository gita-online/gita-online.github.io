Those practising celibacy offer all their senses such as hearing and  seeing
into the fire of their controlled mind and this is their  <i>yagna</i>  or  worship
to the Supreme Lord  Krishna.  The  <i>yagna</i>  that  the  <i>grihastas</i>  or  married
householders perform is to symbolically offer the sense objects  they  enjoy
into the fire of the senses that enjoy them in an attempt to  appease  their
appetites for gratifying themselves in enjoyment.
