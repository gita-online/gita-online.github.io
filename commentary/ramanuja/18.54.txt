Offering one's mind and heart in total surrendered  unto  the  Supreme  Lord
along with all actions  all  worldly  obstacles  and  impediments  shall  be
overcome by His grace.  But  if  one  acts  contrary  to  these  unequivocal
instructions choosing to abide with  erroneous  ideas  of  knowing  what  is
better then the Vedic scriptures  and  instead  disregard  the  instructions
that the Supreme Lord is  giving.  Then  one  will  be  assured  of  certain
failure for verily there is no one superior to Lord Krishna amongst all  the
infinite myriad of created beings nor is there any other creator other  then
He.
