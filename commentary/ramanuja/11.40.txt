The matchless, incomparable glory of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  being
proclaimed. He is the original progenitor of all  creation  full  of  moving
and stationary beings. Being the preceptor of everyone  and  everything  the
resplendent Supreme Lord is most  worshipful  by  all  living  entities.  As
nothing is equal to Him individually or collectively in any respect then  it
is not possible for anything in all of existence  to  be  superior  to  Lord
Krishna in any way.
