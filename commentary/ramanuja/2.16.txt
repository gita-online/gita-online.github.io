That which is known to be <i>asat</i> or material cannot  be  made  to  be  <i>sat</i>  or
spiritual and that which is <i>sat</i> or spiritual annot be made  to  be  <i>asat</i>  or
material. To those established in truth, the ultimate  nature  of  both  are
matters discerned by the direct perception of observation.
<p>
The literal meaning  of  <i>anta</i>  is  end.  Here  it  means  the  summation  or
conclusion of the essential natures  of  <i>sat</i>  and  <i>asat.</i>  The  authoritative
conclusion arrived at by elevated sages in this matter is  that  the  nature
of the physical body is <i>asat</i> being temporary and  that  the  nature  of  the
spiritual soul is <i>sat</i> being eternal. That which is <i>asat</i> is  therefore  known
by its perishable nature and that which is <i>sat</i> is known by its  imperishable
nature. Hence it is clear that what is indicated by  <i>satva  and  asatva</i>  are
the soul and the body.
<p>
In the Visnu Purana the reverend sage  Parasara  states:  knowledge  of  the
atma or soul is indeed satyam or truth and everything else is that which  is
not truth. That which is imperishable is that which is  the  highest  truth.
But that which is derived by  means  of  perishable  things  is  undoubtedly
perishable as well.
<p>
The context here has  no  connection  or  reference  to  what  is  known  as
<i>satkarya-vada</i> of the Sankhya philosophy which vaguely states:  <i>what  is  not</i>
<i>cannot come to be and what is cannot cease to be.</i> For in  this  context  the
Supreme Lord Krishna  is  specifically  instructing  Arjuna  to  dispel  his
delusion, due to not correctly  understanding  the  difference  between  the
perishable nature of the body and the imperishable nature of  the  soul.  It
was in order to emphasise this that the previous verse Chapter  2,  verse  2
was spoken and it is to further elaborate this subject that  the  subsequent
two verses are revealed. But how is it that the  souls  imperishable  nature
is known? The next verse states this.
