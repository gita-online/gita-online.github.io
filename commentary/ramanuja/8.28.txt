Now the result of knowing the Vedic conclusion to this chapter and the
previous chapter is being stated by Lord Krishna with the words vedesu
yagnesu,tapahsu caiva danesu.
vedesu is the study of the Rig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sama Veda and the
Atharva Veda as well as all other Vedic scriptures.
yagnesu is the performance of yagna or various Vedic ritualistic activities
in propitiation
tapahsu is engaging in tapasya or rigorous austerities and penance like
extreme fasting
danesu is giving charity and doing philanthropic works such as feeding the
poor
<p>
All these four activities give great merit but whatever merits are assigned
in the Vedic scriptures for these pious activities they are all eclipsed
and surpassed by that liberated being who knows the glorious pre-eminent
position of the Supreme Lord as revealed by Lord Krishna in these two
chapters. Such a being transcends in their very existence. This means that
the bliss in realising the ultimate reality of the Supreme Lord's paramount
and exalted state in comparison makes the rewards appointed in the Vedas as
insignificant as a blade of grass. To be a yogi or one perfecting the
science of the individual consciousness attaining communion with the
ultimate consciousness, is assuredly achieved by  this transcendence and
such a one assuredly attains the ultimate goal in association with the
Supreme Lord.
