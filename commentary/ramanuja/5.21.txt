The word samsparsaja means contact of the senses with their objects this
precipitates  anticipation for material pleasures which gives the illusion
of happiness by such contact which actually are but a source of misery,
pain and suffering. Lord Krishna is stating that because they are temporary
having a time of beginning and a time of ending, contact with sense objects
is shunned by those of spiritual intelligence who know such contacts are of
a transitory nature.
