The Supreme Lord Krishna has resolved and made it eternal  by  speaking  it,
that whenever His devotee <i>adhyesyate</i> studies the  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita;  He
will accept it as an offering consider Himself served  in  <i>jnana-yagnena</i>  as
direct propitiation and worship unto Him. Such propitiation and  worship  is
what is inculcated in this divine  discourse  where  by  its  transcendental
potency  a  mere  reciting  of  the  verses  equates  to   offering   direct
propitiation and worship unto the Supreme Lord which He affirms He accepts.
