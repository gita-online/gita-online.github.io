So possessing  spiritual intelligence,  knowing  the  soul  to  be  eternal,
understanding it to be  birthless and deathless being  of  an  inexhaustible
nature how is it possible for  anyone  to  commit  any  act  of  destruction
against the immortal soul which dwells in trillions of various  and  diverse
living entities among the 8 million 400 thousand species of life  throughout
the billions of material universes. Whom can anyone destroy? How can  anyone
destroy anyone? Who can cause anyone to be destroyed? No one  can!  Thus  it
can be seen that ignorance of the eternal nature of the soul  is  the  cause
of all grief by not understanding that the soul  is  immortal  and  thinking
that  the  eternal  soul  perishes  when   the   physical   body   perishes.
Comprehending that what happens to the immortal soul when the physical  body
ceases to function is factually the withdrawal from an old physical body  to
enter into a new physical body. So it can be understood that those who  have
deep regret for the loss of the physical body, serving as  it  does  as  the
facility  for  securing  and  enjoying  material  pleasures;  these   living
entities should reflect on the futility  and  temporal  nature  of  material
existence rather than trying to eternally exploit their  senses.  This  will
be further expounded in the next verse.
