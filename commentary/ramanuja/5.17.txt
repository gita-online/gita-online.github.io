The name Brahmana refers  to  the  saintly  and  spiritual  class  in  India
possessed of moral conduct and Vedic knowledge. The mention along with  them
of a cow, an elephant, a dog and an outcaste  person  who  eats  dog  is  to
illustrate the great differences in the physical bodies of all  the  various
species of life  in  which  the  embodied  <i>atma</i>  or  soul  resides  in.  The
variegated appearances of different species of life is due  to  <i>prakriti</i>  or
material nature not the <i>atma.</i> The compound word <i>sama-darsinah</i> meaning  equal
vision is how those in <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation regard all the  <i>atmas</i>
residing in unlimited bodies as being  equal  due  to  the  <i>atmas</i>  essential
nature of being eternal and of being an infinitesimal part  of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna.
