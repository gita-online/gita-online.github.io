Prescribed Vedic activities are <i>niyata</i> or eternal.  Some  are  daily  duties
such as chanting <i>mantras</i> or sacred  incantations  for  the  benefit  of  all
creation at the three junctures of the day. Some are occasional duties  such
as fasting from all grains twice a month on <i>ekadasi</i> which is  the  11th  day
of the waxing and waning moon.  Still  other  prescribed  Vedic   activities
such as a Vishnu <i>yagna</i> which is ritualistic propitiation and worship of  the
Supreme Lord are performed during extraordinary  celebrations  such  as  the
installation of the <i>vigraha</i> or authorised deity form  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna or any of His authorised incarnations and expansions as revealed  in
Vedic scriptures. Ceasing to performed such sanctifying and purifying  Vedic
activities which  benefit  all  creation  would  be  unrighteous  and  cause
unimaginable degradation to humanity specifically and evolution in  general.
Lord Krishna already confirmed  in  chapter  three,  verse  8:  That  bodily
sustenance cannot even be maintained without appropriate  actions  otherwise
it is not possible. . Even if one is able to  assimilate  bodily  sustenance
from sunshine or by air alone as  some  elevated  yogis  do  that  is  still
performing action.

Food not first consecrated unto the Supreme Lord is  considered  sinful  and
such food produces delusion and bewilderment in thinking.  It  is  confirmed
in Chandogya Upanisad VI.V.IV beginning <i>anna mayam  hi  somya  mana</i>  states:
The mind is verily composed from food. The purifying vestiges of  sanctified
food ingested after  the  performance  of  the  holy  <i>yagna</i>  is  capable  of
imparting sacred knowledge conducive to <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation.
Cognition of the Supreme Lord and  communion  with  Him  is  dependent  upon
internal and external purity which are  mandatory  pre-requisites.  Purified
food purifies the mind, a purified  mind  has  the  ability  to  access  the
esoteric spiritual reality that assures <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from  material
existence.  So  the  reality  is  that  prescribed  Vedic   activities   and
obligatory duties are to be performed all throughout one's life even  up  to
the last day of departing the present existence as  they  guarantee  one  is
able to fulfil the goals of human existence. So abstinence  from  performing
them is not in one's best interest. Those  that  desist,  ignore,  disregard
and blaspheme are influenced by illusion and are locked  in  <i>tama  guna</i>  the
mode of ignorance. For it has been traced by the enlightened that  the  idea
of abstinence of prescribed Vedic activities was induced by  <i>tama  guna</i>  and
governed by illusion. Ignorance is that  which  is  hostile  to  wisdom  and
exists  as  perverted  knowledge.  So  abstaining  from   prescribed   Vedic
activities is in the category of  perverted  knowledge.  Lord  Krishna  will
illustrate this futher in verse 32.
