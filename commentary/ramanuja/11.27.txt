As inanimate currents of rapid rivers  are  helplessly  propelled  into  the
ocean as given in the previous verse and like animate  moths  speedily  flit
into a blazing fire and are destroyed. The mighty warriors  of  the  Kaurava
and Pandava armies are propelled helplessly as they speedily rush  to  their
deaths on the battlefield and  into  the  fiery  mouths  of  Lord  Krishna's
<i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form.
