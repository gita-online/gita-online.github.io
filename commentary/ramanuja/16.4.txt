The material world is the place where actions are performed  and  subsequent
<i>karma</i> or reactions to actions are created. Created beings  who  are  of  the
divine nature engage in activities that are of a divine nature  and  created
beings that are of the demoniac nature engage in activities  of  a  demoniac
nature. From their very birth it has been predetermined from the merits  and
demerits accumulated in unlimited past life  activities  whether  or  not  a
<i>jiva</i> or embodied being is of the divine nature following the ordinances  and
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and devoted to the Supreme Lord  Krishna
or  is  of  the  demoniac  nature,  belligerent  and  antagonistic  to   the
ordinances and injunctions of the  Vedic  scriptures  which  compassionately
guide all of creation and opposed to  Lord  Krishna.  Those  of  the  divine
nature have been described at length and are the aspirants  who  strive  and
endeavour to follow the path of the Supreme Lord engaging  in  <i>yoga</i>  or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness by <i>karma</i> or selfless actions<i>, jnana</i> or  knowledge  of
self-realisation and <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion  unto  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna or  any  of  His  authorised  incarnations  and  expansions  as
revealed in Vedic scriptures. Next the demoniac will also  be  described  in
length, illustrating what they were born for and how they behave.
