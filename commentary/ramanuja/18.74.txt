The name <i>yogesvara</i> attributed to Lord Krishna means  the  ultimate  lord  of
all  <i>yogas</i>  or  all  prescribed  Vedic  activities  that  lead  directly  to
communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  who  is  the  sole  bestower   of   all
dispensations, benedictions and rewards for all  endeavours  appropriate  to
the qualification of the aspirant and the quality of the  action  after  the
accumulative <i>karma</i> or reactions to all actions  in  all  forms  of  previous
existences  sentient  or  insentient  have  been  calculated  and  tabulated
throughout all creation. One time one existed as a demigod, another time  as
a demon, aother time as an animal, another time as  a  human  all  forms  of
life are dependent upon the actions performed in the previous life. All  are
subject to diversities of existence. They  have  their  beginning  and  they
have an ending. Only the Supreme Lord who  is  eternally  spiritual  in  His
form, nature and  qualities  being  completely  transcendental  to  material
existence along with His  liberated  associates  and  servitors,  who  first
realising the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul they achieved <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  and
subsequently attained eternal communion with the Supreme Lord.

Wherever  Lord  Krishna  and  Arjuna  are  present  and  whenever  they  are
glorified by thinking about them, or reading about them, or  speaking  about
them, or hearing about them, then  at  that  very  place  will  be  <i>srih</i>  or
opulence, <i>vijaya</i>  or victory, <i>bhutih</i> or opulence and <i>niti</i> or  righteousness.
