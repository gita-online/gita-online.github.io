It is a  natural  tendency  for  the  <i>ksatriyas</i>  or  royal  warriors  to  be
heroically predisposed to fight for a righteous cause. In the case of  <i>mohat</i>
out of delusion having the false notion to  abstain  from  fulfilling  their
natural duty so strong is it  that  one  will  definitely  be  compelled  to
plunge into battle even against one's own will when one has been hurled  the
bitter sting of insults and deprecations of cowardice from one's  opponents.
Indeed all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings are bound by  the  indomitable  laws  of
<i>karma</i> or reactions from past actions assuming  various  physical  bodies  to
invariably adhere to the influence  of  the  predominant  <i>guna</i>  or  mode  of
material nature.
