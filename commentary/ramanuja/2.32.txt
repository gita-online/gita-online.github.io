The  impending  war  is  happening  by  itself,  on  its  own,  without  any
solicitation on the part  of  Arjuna.  Thus  when  it  happens  he  and  his
brothers will be fighting on the side  of  righteousness  which  constitutes
the means for acquiring heavenly happiness without  obstacles.  Such  a  war
can only be fought by the most fortunate  of  <i>ksatriya</i>s  and  Arjuna  should
understand his good fortune.
