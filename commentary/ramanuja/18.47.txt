Lord  Krishna  explains  that  when  <i>buddhi</i>  or  spiritual  intelligence  is
unfettered meaning unattached  to  desires  and  rewards  and  the  mind  is
controlled  and  senses  conquered,  with  no   conceptions   of   doership,
established  in  renunciation  even  while   performing   prescribed   Vedic
activities one attains the supreme  serene  state  of  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive
loving devotion unto the Supreme Lord by <i>dhyana</i> or meditation  in  communion
with Him internally as well as propitiation to Him with one's physical  body
externally such as <i>japa</i> or chanting His divine, holy names  in  ecstasy  and
promulgating His glories everywhere one goes  throughout  creation.  By  the
wonderfulness of <i>bhakti</i> the mind  and  senses  are  already  controlled  and
conquered quite easily and have  surpassed  the  limits  of  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  or
facilitating communion with the Supreme Lord by knowledge.
