Lord Krishna explains that when the <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  being  is  in  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> or mode of goodness at the time of death then numerous blessed  regions
are reached where the knowers of <i>atma tattva</i> or knowledge  of  the  immortal
soul are  residing.  The  word  <i>amalan</i>  means  pure,  exempt  from  blemish,
denoting devoid of ignorance. The understanding is that the fate of  a  <i>jiva</i>
who dies under the influence of <i>sattva guna</i> would be so beneficial  that  it
would predetermine that the next birth would take place in  the  enviornment
of pious and holy people that have realised  <i>atma  tattva</i>  and  so  combined
with an inner impulse to pursue this way of life  and  with  opportunity  in
abundance one would continue in <i>sattva guna</i>  purifying  one's  existence  by
performing spiritual activities until one achieves perfection.
