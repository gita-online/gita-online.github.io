From food all creatures procreate and from rain food is produced. The  whole
world is witness to this. As for the evidence that <i>yagna</i> or  worship  causes
rainfall <i>sastra</i> or the Vedic scriptures give proof. In Manu  Samhita  III.76
we find that oblations properly offered into the sacred fire ascend  upwards
to the sun, and from the sun rain  clouds  are  produced.  Actions  such  as
earning funds are accomplished by the physical  body  when  actions  utilise
such wealth following the  prescribed  injunction  of  the  Vedas  then  the
result is <i>yagna</i>. The word <i>Brahma</i> here  denotes  the  universal  body  as  an
aggregate of all material particles. The word  <i>aksara</i>  means  indestructible
or imperishable in the verse  <i>brahma-aksara</i>  refers  to  the  eternal  <i>jiva-</i>
<i>atma,</i> the individual soul. It is the <i>jiva-atma</i> who  monitors  the  body  and
gives it consciousness and impels it nourish itself through food and  water,
fortifying it to engage in the prescribed actions of the  Vedas.  Hence  the
physical body which serves as the medium for actions  is  said  to  manifest
from the all prevasive universal body of  the  <i>Brahman.</i>  Thus  the  physical
body itself is the essential item which every votary of  <i>yagna</i> must  possess
and is the indispensable prerequisite for the performance of  <i>yagna.</i>
<p>
So from actions comes <i>yagna,</i> from <i>yagna</i> rain, from rainfall  food  and  from
food embodied beings. This cycle was set into motion  by  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna at the beginning of creation. This cycle is  never  ending  and  was
designed to exist perpetually providing all  necessities  for  the  embodied
beings allowing them to prosper and flourish, Whoever is born on this  Earth
whether they are performers of actions  or  contemplators  of  the  ultimate
truth, the Supreme Brahman; if they fail to adhere to and follow and  adhere
to this cycle leads a sinful life for the simple reason that  they  fail  to
even support and preserve their own embodied  existence  by  sanctifying  it
with the daily food remnants  eaten that was first offered in <i>yagna.</i>
<p>
The word <i>agha-ayuh</i> means full of sin, this can be either that one's life  is
committed to making sins or that one is living a life perpetuated by sin  or
it can even mean both. In this way such a sinner becomes an <i>indriyaramah</i>  or
one who only seeks delights in the beguiling  garden  of  the  senses  using
their valuable human life only for the pursuit of pleasure,  a  slave  under
the control of  sense delights. Therefore such a one never takes delight  in
the soul and is the antithesis of an <i>atmaramah</i> or one who  delights  in  the
garden of the <i>atma</i> or soul.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Food eaten that was not first sanctified by being consecrated  in  <i>yagna</i>  or
offering of worship beforehand ignites <i>rajas</i> or passions in one and  incites
<i>tamas</i> or darkness of intellect. A person  in  whom  these  dispositions  are
prominent  becomes  hostile  to  achieving  an  even  rudimental   spiritual
illumination let alone <i>atma-tattva</i> or self-realisation of the soul.  Such  a
hostile person only finds pleasure in pursuing  pleasure  to  gratify  their
senses.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Blessed with the gift of a human body which is suitable for offering  Divine
worship  in  <i>yagna</i>  and  which  therefore  which  must  be  nourished   with
sanctified food duly consecrated so ones actions fulfill there  purpose.  If
one errs and fails to honour and respect this eternal  cycle  given  in  the
Vedic injunctions, then all there hopes for spiritual realisation  will  not
be fulfilled and all their efforts are destined to failure.  There  complete
life was lived in vain.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
So from this it can be understood that the  necessity  for  the  actions  of
<i>yagna as</i> prescribed in the Vedic scriptures are essential and  indispensable
for the different <i>varnas</i> or castes and <i>asramas</i> or stages  of  society.  Only
that person who has attained <i>moksa</i> or complete liberation from the cycle  of
birth and death in the material nature is under no obligation to in any  way
whatsoever to perform any activity due to the fact that the  achievement  of
<i>atma-tattva</i> self-realisation of the soul has already been attained.
