11 That person who by their actions  do  not  become  a  cause  of  fear  or
trouble in their life and  causing no affliction to the world has
no cause to feel afflicted  by  the  world.  As  no  elements  of
antagonism exist in such a one, no action received from the world
can be taken as being aggression at any time.  One  who  is  free
from giving or receiving joy and grief to any being who  is  free
from all conceptions of being the bestower  of  anything  or  the
recipient of anything is very dear to the Supreme Lord Krishna.
