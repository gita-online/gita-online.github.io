There are some perform especially wealthy and opulent  <i>yagnas</i>  or  offerings
and worship known as <i>artha yagnas</i>. By this method they  earn  money  honesty
and donate it for temple worship and for articles of  worship.  Others  feed
the poor or bear the expenses  of  feeding  everyone  at  festivals  of  the
Supreme Lord and His incarnations. Others have Brahmins  perform  <i>Yagas</i>  and
<i>Homas</i> or special ceremonies for birth and weddings and  death  .  All  these
are known as <i>artha yagnas.</i> Others betake themselves to  <i>tapasaya  yagnas</i>  or
expiatory penances and strict austerities  such  as  fasting.  Still  others
resort to <i>yoga yagnas</i> or the communion of the individual consciousness  with
the ultimate consciousness following the prescribed Vedic  injunctions.  The
communion referred to here is the  individual  communing  by  pilgrimage  to
holy places such as Kurukshetra, to holy rivers like  the  Ganges,  to  holy
tirthas like Jagannatha Puri, to holy birthplaces  like  Lord  Krishna's  in
Mathura. This is what is meant by <i>yoga yagnas.</i>  Others  exclusively  perform
<i>svadhyaya yagna</i> or the study of the Vedic scriptures. Others practice  <i>jnana</i>
<i>yoga</i> or the cultivation of Vedic knowledge and  contemplate and  reflect  on
the purport of the Vedic scriptures to  better  understand  them.  The  word
<i>yatayah</i> means diligent and refers to <i>yatis</i> or  renunciates  who  assiduously
persevere to accomplish all that they  vow  to  spiritually  undertake.  The
compound word <i>samsita-vratah</i> means they who  have  firm  resolve  and  fixed
determination and refers to the <i>yatis.</i>
