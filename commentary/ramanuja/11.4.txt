The word <i>avyayam</i> means in  entirety.  Arjuna  wishes  to  see  the  complete
<i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form  of  Lord  Krishna.  The  word  <i>yogesvara</i>
means the  lord  of  <i>yoga</i>  or  perfecting  the  science  of  the  individual
consciousness attaining communion with the ultimate  consciousness.  As  the
lord of <i>yoga</i> He possesses  all  divine  attributes  such  a  wisdom,  power,
sovereignty, splendour and glory to the maximum degree that is not found  to
be possessed by any other except Himself  and  is  impossible  to  duplicate
even a portion of it. These will become clearly apparent in the  next  verse
when Lord  Krishna  tells  Arjuna  what  he  will  see  when  beholding  His
magnificent <i>visvarupa</i>. To alleviate the  yearning  of  supplication  of  His
disciple who was earnestly desirous to see His  divine  universal  form  and
who was enlivened and  animated  in  rapturous  emotion,  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna spoke as follows.
