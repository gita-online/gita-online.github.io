Any religious ritual or ceremony of any kind that is <i>vidhi-hinam</i>  or  devoid
of following the ordinances and injunctions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  and
without being conducted by Vaisnavas and brahmanas who are pre-eminent  both
in precept and in practice is recognizably known to  be  fully  situated  in
<i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance. The words <i>asrsta-annam</i>  means  without  the
sanctified food and ingredients required to  perform  a  bonafide  <i>yagna</i>  or
propitiation and worship. The prohibition  is  that  no  ingredient  may  be
acquired from those without faith in Lord Krishna;  so  it  is  a  mandatory
requirement that all ingredients are to  be  received  only  from  devotees.
Those situated in <i>tama guna</i> cannot fulfil this  mandate.  So  in  conclusion
whatever religious activity  that  is  performed  without  adhering  to  the
authority of the Vedic scriptures, without Vaisnavas and brahmanas  chanting
Vedic mantras and without adoration of the Supreme Lord Krishna  or  any  of
His authorised incarnations and expansions is not valid and being  bogus  is
totally situated in <i>tama guna.</i> If such activities  were  anyway  somehow  or
other able to be  clandestinely  orchestrated  by  unqualified  schemers  it
would still have no efficacy due to the absence of devotion to Lord  Krishna
and lack of faith in the absolute authority of the Vedic scriptures.
