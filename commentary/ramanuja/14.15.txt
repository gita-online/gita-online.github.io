Now Lord Krishna describes that when a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being dies while  in
<i>raja guna</i> or the mode of passion one takes birth  among  those  who  perform
activities out of desire for rewards and  having  been  born  as  such  will
endeavour mightily to accomplish works that would  be  rewarded  by  immense
wealth and power even up unto the heavenly spheres. Similarly  if  one  dies
while under the influnce of <i>tama guna</i> or the mode  of  ignorance  then  such
<i>jivas</i> will be born from the wombs of animals such as  pigs  and  dogs  where
one would be completely incapacitated to perform  any  activity  that  would
give any spiritual benefit.
