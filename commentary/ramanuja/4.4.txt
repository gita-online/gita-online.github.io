The sun-god Visvavan had duly received the Bhagavad-Gita from  Lord  Krishna
120 million years previously;  yet  he  was  Arjuna's  contemporary;  so  an
explanation of this  anomalous  anachronism  is  being  requested.  One  may
question what is the purpose to ask this from  one  who  is  aware  of  Lord
Krishna's supreme position for it is known  that  even   saintly  and  noble
souls remember events from  previous  incarnations.  Also  before  when  the
Pandava king Yudhisthira  performed  the  Rajasuya  ceremony  the  grandsire
Bhishma was heard to say that Lord  Krishna  alone  is  the  origin  of  all
created beings  and  the  beginning  and  the  ending  of  all  movable  and
immovable beings. So the reason Arjuna asked such  a  question  was  to  get
clarification presented in an exposition on the meaning of <i>avatars</i>  or  Lord
Krishna's authorised incarnations in the Vedic scriptures and  answer  these
questions.
1) Are <i>avatars</i> real or illusory?
2) Under what circumstances do <i>avatars</i> manifest?
3) What is the nature of the body the <i>avatar</i> assumes?
4) Are all the <i>avatars</i> expanding from Lord Krishna?
5) Are all the <i>avatars</i> omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent?
6) Are all <i>avatars</i> transcendental to the cycle of birth and death?
7) Are all <i>avatars</i> able to  fulfill all desires?
8) What is the time schedule which <i>avatars</i> manifest themselves?
<p>
This was the purpose of this question so Lord Krishna would give  an  expose
on these topics.
