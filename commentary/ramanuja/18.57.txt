<i>Isvarah</i> is the all pervading Supreme Lord as the indwelling  monitor  within
<i>hrid dese</i> the core of the heart which is the source  of  all  consciousness,
the basis of all actions <i>pravritti</i> or passive  and  <i>nivritti</i>  or  energetic.
The Supreme Lord abides simultaneously in the etheric heart  of  every  <i>jiva</i>
or embodied being in a subatomic form known as <i>paramatma</i> the  Supreme  Soul.
Once so installed the Supreme Lord activates,  energises  and  animates  the
physical body of the <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being.  <i>Maya</i>  the  external  illusory
potency  bombasts  and  buffets  the  <i>jivas</i>  interminably  in  the  material
existence in accordance to and consistent with the <i>guna</i> or mode of  material
nature  which  is  predominate.  The   Brihadaranyaka   Upanisad   III.VI.XV
beginning <i>yah sarvesu bhutesu tisthan</i> states: The  Supreme  Lord  abides  in
all beings and controls all living entities  internally.
