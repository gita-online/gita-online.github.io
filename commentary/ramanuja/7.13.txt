Everything existing in creation, abounding in objects animate and  inanimate
is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord Krishna. At appointed and periods  it
emanates from Him and at  appointed  periods  it  emanates  back  into  Him.
Everything is existent within Him alone, forming  His  transcendental  body,
covering all the universes which He ensouls with the life force.  Thus  Lord
Krishna alone is eternally existent both in potential and  in  manifestation
for He is both the cause and the effect. For all things  are  constitute  as
parts of His body and are related to Him as adjuncts.  Whether  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna is considered to be the cause as the  Sovereign  Lord;  or  the
effect as the possessor of innumerable  hosts  of  glorious  attributes  and
myriads of marvellous qualities; or in many other descriptions it should  be
consummately comprehended that He is the most superior above all things  and
designations and that there is not a  second  who  is  qualified  to  be  so
characterised.

But the world in general does  not  know  Lord  Krishna's  exalted  position
which is far beyond <i>tribhir guna</i> the three modes of  material  nature  being
goodness, passion and ignorance. The world  does  not  realise  His  Supreme
position as the possessor of multitudes of extraordinary blessed  attributes
and as such  knows Him not as that  supreme  bliss  and  joy  without  which
nothing can exist and which constitutes the life of all created beings.  The
word <i>avyayam</i>  means  imperishable  this  is  synonymous  with  infinite  and
eternal. Although He is all this, the beings of creation consisting of demi-
gods, humans, animals, aquatics and plant life are all oblivious to  it  and
completely beguiled by the trivial and fascinated by the  ephemeral  in  the
form of objects appearing as physical bodies and subtle  senses  adopted  to
furnish  enjoyments  for  the  utilisation  of  pleasure  according  to  the
dispensations  doled  out  from  previous  impressions  of  old  <i>karmas</i>   or
reactions from past activities.  Due  to  these  impediments  the  world  in
general is not able to know Him.

If reflecting Arjuna were to ask: How is it possible that Lord  Krishna  who
surpasses every joy and  delight  that  material  existence  is  capable  of
offering, whose immeasurable  beatitude,  eternality  and  immutability  are
gloriously effulgent is not perceived by the world? And if  Arjuna  were  to
further ask: How is it possible that desire and  attachment  arises  in  the
hearts of  embodied souls for the same repetitive pleasures  over  and  over
again without satiation to the point of redundancy?

Lord Krishna answers with the words <i>mama maya duratyaya</i> explaining that  His
illusory energy is very difficult to surmount. In as much as this  His  <i>maya</i>
or illusion permeates His <i>prakriti</i> or material substratum through the  three
<i>gunas</i> or modes of  <i>sattva</i>  or  goodness,  <i>rajas</i>  or  passion  and  <i>tamas</i>  or
ignorance; so it is extremely difficult  to  overcome.  The  total  material
manifestation is under its sway and influenced by it. It  is  <i>daivi</i>  meaning
divine and is created by Lord  Krishna  for  the  purpose  of  sport  as  is
deduced from the root word <i>div</i> meaning to play. Its designation by the  term
<i>maya</i> is on account of its potency  to  produce  phenomenal  effects  in  the
gross  material  existence  albeit  depending  upon  the  breadth  of  one's
knowledge. These phenomenal effects are even manifested from  the  spiritual
worlds as  in  the  case  of  Lord  Krishna  dispatching  His  intrepid  and
impervious <i>Sudarsana Cakra</i>  or  fiery  transcendental  disc  to  shield  and
protect  the  physical  body  of  His  devotee  Prahlad  causing  the   1000
incantation manifestations to fail to harm him one  after  the  other.  They
are also analogous to  the  <i>brahmastra's</i>  or  mantra  governed  missles  and
arrows discharged in battle by regal <i>ksatriya's</i> or the royal  warrior  class
as were exhibited in the Battle  of  Kurushetra.  They  are  also  sometimes
manifested in the evil magic of the <i>asuras</i> meaning literally  those  without
light and the sorcery of the <i>rakshasas</i> which are  human  eating  demons  and
fiends.

The term <i>maya</i> never signifies what is false. The term <i>mayair</i> is  applied  to
that which is able to produce real impressions  upon  another's  imagination
albeit individual or collective. The effect is certainly real  although  the
cause is definitely illusory. Like  a  magician  by  the  art  of  conjuring
produces marvellous effects upon the minds of those witnessing by  means  of
incantations; so that when <i>mayair</i> designates  a  producer  of  real  effects
which are not false, the word <i>maya</i> denotes  the  incantation  by  which  the
manifestion was effected. Wherever the term <i>maya</i> is  found  to  be  used  it
invariably means that which has the ability  of  activating  phenomenal  and
marvellous material effects and is universally accepted.  An  example  is  a
crate of Chinese fireworks is just another crate of dry  goods  lying  in  a
warehouse; but when activated by someone knowledgeable at night it  produces
marvellous and real effects in the sky. Whenever the word <i>maya</i>  is  used  to
suggest the illusion of non-reality instead of a real  impression  upon  the
mind then such  application  is  only  figurative  and  subordinate  to  the
universal understanding which  is  not  to  be  usurped  by  the  figurative
understanding. When one reads 100 lances fought in battle it means  the  100
men who carry the lances. So like this in this way the word <i>maya</i>  should  be
understood. This <i>maya</i> of the Supreme Lord  which  is  capable  of  producing
sublime and marvellous effects which permeates the entire material  creation
is the only <i>maya</i> to  be  considered  as  any  other  is  but  figurative  or
metaphorical. The Svetasvatara Upanisad states:  <i>mayan-tu  prakritim  vidyat</i>
<i>mahinan-tu mahesvaram</i> which means  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum  then
<i>prakriti</i> is to be apprehended  by  the  word  <i>maya</i>  and  <i>mahesvaram</i>  or  the
Supreme Lord by the word <i>mayi.</i> It is the responsibilty of <i>maya</i> to  veil  the
true nature of the Supreme Lord from the miscreants and unqualified  and  to
lure  such  beings  to  constantly  chase  after  the   desire   for   sense
gratification. Hence all the worlds  are  beguiled  and  bewildered  by  the
intrepid effect of <i>maya</i> from the  time  they  are  born  and  thus  fail  to
recognise the magnificent splendour and wonderous  glories  of  the  Supreme
Lord  Krishna  who  is  eternity,  knowledge  and   bliss   personified   of
immeasurable transcendental nature.

The next verse  will  give  the  means  of  deliverance  and  redemption  to
alleviate this situation.
