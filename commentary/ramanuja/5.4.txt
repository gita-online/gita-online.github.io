They are misinformed and not conversant  with  Vedic  scriptures  who  think
that  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  prescribed  Vedic  activities  and  <i>jnana  yoga</i>   the
renunciation of rewards of actions by the cultivation Vedic  knowledge  give
different results and do not both award <i>atma tattva</i> or  realisation  of  the
soul. Although <i>karma yoga</i> may go through the path of <i>jnana yoga</i> it may  also
independently achieve <i>atma tattva</i> by  its  own  merit.  So  as  long  as  an
aspirant firmly adopts either path with determination they  are  assured  of
success. This is further expanded by Lord Krishna in the next verse.
