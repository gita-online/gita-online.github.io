Now Lord Krishna reveals that the whole  creation  consisting  of  unlimited
moving and stationary things are all contained  in  <i>ihaikastham</i>  meaning  in
only one part of His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form  and  anything  else
that could be desired to be seen is in this location as well.  This  denotes
that there are many other marvels  and  wonders  in  other  parts  that  are
undisclosed.
