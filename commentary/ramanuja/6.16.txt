The words <i>atmany evavatisthate</i> means exclusively established in the <i>atma</i>  or
soul. This means the <i>atma</i> has become the highest goal  and  only  object  of
endeavour. When the mind has been so tutored and regimented to be fixed  and
riveted to the <i>atma</i> so that it never strays away; it is  simultaneously  and
automatically weaned from all desires for  sense  gratification  having  not
the slightest interest to enjoy the objects of the senses. Lord  Krishna  is
stating that  at  this  time  an  aspirant  is  considered  to  possess  the
necessary qualifications to begin practising mediation.
