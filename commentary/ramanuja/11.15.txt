Everywhere from every angle of vision could  be  seen  infinite  amounts  of
unlimited arms, stomachs, faces, and eyes. The word  <i>visvesvara</i>  means  Lord
of the universe and <i>visvarupa</i> the divine universal form denotes the  Supreme
Lord to whom all the cosmos is part  of  His  transcendental  body.  As  the
Supreme Lord Krishna is <i>ananta</i> or endless it is understandable that  He  has
no beginning, middle or end and this was perceived by Arjuna.
