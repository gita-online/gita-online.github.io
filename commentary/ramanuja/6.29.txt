Revealing his heart to Lord Krishna some questions are asked  by  Arjuna  to
be clarified as he does not fully comprehend this <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness as done in <i>dhyana</i> or meditation  which  allows  equanimity  in
reality and which enables one to perceive the <i>atma</i> or  soul  in  all  beings
and envision the <i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading all existence  in
all situations.  Specifically it could be understood regarding the  sameness
of the <i>atma</i> in all living entities and that the  <i>atma</i>  is  residing  equally
within all living entities as well as the reality of  the  liberated  beings
possessing a portion of the qualities of the Supreme. But to  maintain  such
lofty conceptions in the  midst  of  the  demanding,  periodically  changing
interactions of daily life seems to be in direct conflict  with  our  vision
of the phenomenal world we live in seeing  external  differences  everywhere
we look. As well there are  an  unlimited  variety  of  differences  in  the
nature of beings  as represented by the divine  nature,  the  human  nature,
the demoniac nature and various combinations of  all  three.  Not  being  to
understand how the results of such  <i>yoga</i>  can  be  sustained  a  predicament
arises and Arjuna surmises that the fault must be due to the constraints  of
the mind being unable to fully manifest them. This is  true  as  it  can  be
experienced that in even normal mundane matters of ordinary  activities  the
naturally restless mind eludes all attempts to focus it on a  specific  idea
for too long.  The mind exerting  itself  powerfully  will  twist  and  turn
itself loose without delay and irresistibly fly off  in  whatever  direction
it fancies. So if such is the case in ordinary  activities  what  is  to  be
assumed in regard to the difficulty of focusing the mind exclusively on  the
<i>atma.</i> Arjuna was thinking that to control  the  mind  is  as  difficult  and
daunting as trying to thwart the winds of a hurricane with a  hand  fan.  So
in conclusion Arjuna is requesting Lord  Krishna  to  instruct  him  how  to
control the tempestuous mind.
