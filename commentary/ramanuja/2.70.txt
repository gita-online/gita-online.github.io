The word <i>kamas</i> means desires or those things which one wishes to enjoy  such
as taste or touch. Lord Krishna is instructing that whoever  can  relinquish
these desires is free from craving, free from my-ness  the  conception  that
these things are mine and free from I-ness, my-ness and the conception  that
I am this body. Such a one not  bewildered  does  misidentify  the  physical
body as being the soul, rather such a one perceives  the  soul  and  attains
peace.
