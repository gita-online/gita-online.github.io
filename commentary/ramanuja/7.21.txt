The demigods such as Indra the celestial chief, Surya  the  sungod  and  all
others constitute the body of the Supreme Lord as stated in  the  Taittiriya
Upanisad V.I. Although those who worship the demigods are ignorant  of  this
truth as declared in  Vedic  scriptures.  In  the  Brihad-aranyaka  Upanisad
V.VII.IX beginning <i>ya aditye tish than yam adityo na veda</i> it states: Who  is
seated in the sun, but whom the sun knoweth not, whom the sun  is  comprised
of etc.  Whomsoever  wishes  to  worship  the  demigods,  the  Supreme  Lord
sanctions that they have unwavering  and  stable  faith  in  that  endeavour
because that very faith is given to that which is a  part  of  my  universal
form and constitutes the Supreme Lord Krishna's body.
