As <i>yoga</i> or the science of the individual consciousness  attaining  communion
with the ultimate consciouness leads to  the  highest  aspiration  of  human
existence. It is known that <i>yoga</i> is greater what is attainable  by  ascetics
living austerities, greater than what is attainable by Vedic knowledge  that
is bereft of knowledge of the soul and greater than what is attained by  the
performance of ritualistic ceremonies prescribed  in  the  Vedas  concerning
fruitive rewards. Hence the  <i>yogi</i>  is  superior  to  all  these.  Thus  Lord
Krishna encourages Arjuna to become a  <i>yogi.</i>  This  verse  is  a  eulogy  on
higher theosophy and it  relates  to  the  acquisition  of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul as the preliminary step to God realisation.
