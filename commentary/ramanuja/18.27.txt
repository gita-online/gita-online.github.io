One who is unqualified  not  having  the  requisite  competence  to  perform
prescribed Vedic activities. Who is <i>prakritah</i> or mundane and  hence  vulgar,

engage  in  spiritual  activities.  Who  is  <i>sathah</i>  or  wicked   having   a
predilection for evil and sorcery. Who is lazy, morose  and  deceitful.  Who
is <i>dirgha-sutri</i> rancorously insulting of others  from  envy  and  harbouring
deep, dark vengeance against them. Such a one is unremittingly  situated  in
<i>tama guna</i> the mode of passion.
