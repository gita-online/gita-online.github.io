The demigods being exclusively from <i>sattva-guna</i> or the  nature  of  goodness
rejoice upon seeing Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine  universal  form  and
are awe inspired and enraptured. Some among  them  were  frightened  by  the
<i>visvarupa</i> terrifying aspect which was also wonderful and bowed  down  to  it
with folded hands offering eulogies of praise and  prayers  of  supplication
each  according  to  their  perceptions.  Other  great  souls  such  as  the
<i>Siddhas</i> or perfected beings who have realised the higher  and  lower  truths
utter the benediction <i>svastity</i> meaning my there be all  auspiciousness.  The
<i>maharishis</i> or liberated sages upon beholding the  <i>visvarupa</i>  loudly  resound
the words <i>Jaya Jaya</i> meaning all glory, all glory and  spontaneously  compose
wonderful Sankrit hymns in glorification of it while   performing  <i>sankirtan</i>
or congregational singing of the Supreme  Lords  Krishna's  <i>visvarupa</i>  along
with His transcendental names, forms, qualities and pastimes.
