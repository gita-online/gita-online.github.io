Lord Krishna explains the three fold nature of <i>yagna</i> or  performing  rituals
of propitiation and  worship.  He  begins  with  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of
goodness. The  words  <i>aphala-akariksibhih</i>  means  performing  <i>yagna</i>  to  the
Supreme Lord without a desire for any reward. <i>Vidhi-distah</i> means  performing
it  in  accordance  with  the  ordinances  and  injunctions  of  the   Vedic
scriptures. <i>Yastavyam eveti</i> means performed  as  a  matter  of  duty  or  as
<i>bhakti</i> exclusive loving devotion unto the Supreme Lord  Krishna  or  any  of
His authorised <i>avatars</i> or incarnations and expansions as revealed  in  Vedic
scriptures. Such <i>yagnas</i> must be performed by duly  initiated  Vaisnavas  and
brahmanas chanting prescribed Vedic mantras for the  exclusive  satisfaction
of the Supreme Lord. When such a resolve manifests a <i>yagna</i> into  reality  in
this manner it is to be known as situated in <i>sattva guna.</i>
