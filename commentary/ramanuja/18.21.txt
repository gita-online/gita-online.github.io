One who clings to a single activity in a stagnant and obstinate manner  such
as the worship of an impersonal conception of God and  considers  that  such
an insignificant activity has the highest perfection  in  existence  to  the
exclusion  of  all  other  possibilities  and  not  considering  any   other
conception as tenable and in stagnation ceases to develop and  grow  is  the
epitome of one shackled in <i>tama guna.</i> The word <i>ahaitakam</i>  means  irrational,
without reason, imagining that which gives  meagre  results  to  give  great
results.  The  words  <i>attatva-arthavat</i>  means  devoid  of  reality,  without
substantiation of the Vedic scriptures. The  word  <i>alpan</i>  means  limited  in
scope and relates to foolish, trivial pagan acts such as  worshiping  ghosts
and spirits for material power. So thus  showing  how  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or
modes of material nature have a direct effect on the knowledge possessed  by
the performer of any action; Lord  Krishna  will  next  expound  upon  their
direct influence upon actions themselves.
