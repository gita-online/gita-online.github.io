The austerities of the mind are  <i>manah-prasadah</i>  or  self  satisfaction  and
serenity  free from mental imbalances. The word  <i>saumyatvam</i>  means  serenity
and benevolence to others.  <i>Maunam</i>  is  silence  externally  and  reflecting
internally. <i>Atma-vinigrahah</i> is self-controlling the mind to stay focused  on
realisation of the <i>atma.</i> <i>Bhava-samsuddhih</i> is purity  within  and  purity  of
purpose. These austerities of mind are confirmed by Lord Krishna  to  be  in
<i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
