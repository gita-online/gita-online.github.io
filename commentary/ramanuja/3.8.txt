The word <i>nityatam</i> can refer to eternal, regular or even  daily.  An  act  is
eternal if it is connected to the <i>atma</i> which is the eternal  soul.   Actions
merely connected to  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  nature  are  a  persistent
inheritance from one's past activities in the unknown past. Thus to  perform
actions comes easily as a natural phenomena and not subject to the  inherent
dangers  of  possessing  an  impure  mind  or  the  lack  of  sense  control
associated the with <i>jnana yoga,</i>  the  cultivation  of  spiritual  knowledge.
Therefore Lord Krishna is urging Arjuna to perform  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  actions
without attachment as in his case it is superior to  cultivating  knowledge.
<i>A-karma</i> is non-action which implies cultivating knowledge by the  abstention
of activities. But it is  known  that  it  is  not  possible  to  completely
achieve the actionless state.  Even for the  followers  of  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  the
path of <i>karma yoga</i> is superior because in <i>jnana yoga</i> one must follow a  path
one is naturally not accustomed, is difficult to practice, fraught with  the
risk of dominant senses  and  also  which  does  not  flow  as  an  inherent
tendency like the path of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  where  actions  follow  the  natural
locomotion of the body in the course of daily activities.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Further  it  will  be  shown  that  even  one  who  is  liberated  by  <i>atma-</i>
<i>tattva</i> realisation of the eternal soul; still may be  involved  in  so  many
activities, performing actions without attachment or as a  matter  of  duty.
Thus even <i>atma-tattva</i> can be connected to material  activities  transforming
them to spiritual activities. Hence <i>karma yoga</i> can be superior in this  way.
What can be inferred about the superiority of <i>karma  yoga</i>  over  <i>jnana  yoga</i>
will be evident to one who is actually engaged in practising <i>jnana yoga.</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
But an alternative argument could be alright suppose one  is  determined  to
abstain from all actions, then how does one expect to maintain their  bodily
existence which depends on eating and sleeping and  washing  and  exercising
etc. and by which the body is very helpful and useful in  practising   <i>jnana</i>
<i>yoga.</i> The maintenance of one's physical  body  is  absolutely  essential  to
complete the course charted in life until one achieves their goal.  The  way
in which one maintains their body is by actions such as labour  by  rightful
means to acquire funds for performing worship to God by  offerings  of  food
which are subsequently imbued with spiritual potency  and  by  partaking  of
the remnants of such foods solely for bodily sustenance  each  day  maintain
their bodies.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In the Chandogya Upanisad VII.XXVI.II we find: It is by the purity  of  food
that one's mind becomes purified. When the  mind  is  purified  one  attains
access to the eternal soul dwelling within the heart.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Thus if one desires to desist  from  all  activities  how  will  their  mind
become purified  and how will their bodily needs be maintained? Thus  it  is
obvious that one who practices <i>jnana yoga</i> in order to maintain their  bodily
existence must still continue performing the  daily  and  occasional  duties
prescribed in the Vedas until they reach their goal.  The  same  as  if  one
practised <i>karma yoga.</i> Also in <i>karma yoga</i> the  contemplation  of  <i>atma-tattva</i>
is also included in the conceptions that I am not my body perfoming  actions
and I am not the actual doer of any actions. So for all these reasons  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> is preferably recommended to <i>jnana yogis.</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>
So the conclusion is for Arjuna to desist and practice <i>karma yoga.</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
But if it is still postulated that actions such as the  acquiring  of  funds
involves the my-ness  of this is my money and the I-ness of  I  have  earned
this by the strength of my mind and the  power  of  my  faculties  and  that
these efforts must cause bondage Lord Krishna refutes this argument  in  the
next verse.
