Only two types  of  livining  entities  exist  in  creation.  They  are  the
<i>ksarah</i> or  perishable  and  the  <i>aksarah</i>  or  imperishable.  That  which  is
designated as a <i>jiva</i> or embodied being is known as perishahable, from  Bahma
to a blade of grass all are subject to limited  transitory  existences.  The
singular form of the word <i>atma</i> or immortal soul denotes the totality of  all
<i>jivas</i> as a category inasmuch as they all possess the <i>atma</i> and are all  bound
to material  nature.  The  word  <i>aksarah</i>  meaning  infallible,  imperishable
refers to the freed <i>jiva</i> who is  situated  in  its  own  eternal,  essential
nature  and  not  bound  by  material  nature.  The  word  <i>kutasthah</i>   means
immutable, constant in regard  to  its  lack  of  associaion  with  material
nature having no connection to the physical plane. The singular use of  this
word denotes all <i>jivas</i> collectively who are liberated from material  nature.
It should be understood that such <i>jivas</i> are innumerable as Lord Krishna  has
revealed previously in chapter 4, verse 10 that  many  purifying  themselves
by knowledge and meditation have achieved the supreme, liberated state.
