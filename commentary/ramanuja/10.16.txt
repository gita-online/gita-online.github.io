Previously in verse eight Lord Krishna  revealed  that  He  is  the  Supreme
Absoulte Truth, the Ultimate Reality and the cause and origin  of  all.  Now
He is being requested to elaborate in more detail and supply  further  facts
about His <i>vibhuti</i> or Supreme transcendental opulence and  His  Supreme  <i>yoga</i>
being the science of the individual consciousness attaining  communion  with
the ultimate consciousness, in regard to His  Supreme  rulership  throughout
all  creation.  Arjuna  confesses  that  listening   to   His   unparalleled
instructions is exactly like ambrosial nectar and he is  never  satiated  by
it.
