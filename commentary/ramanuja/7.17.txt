Of the previous four classes the <i>jnani's</i> or the knowers of the Supreme  Lord
are distinctly distinguished as they are <i>nitya-yukta</i> or eternally  connected
and <i>eka-bhaktir</i> or exclusively  devoted  to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  by
reason of His being their only goal. Others merely  establish  relationships
with Him for selfish purposes in hope of gaining desired  material  objects.
But from the knowers of the Supreme Lord emerge the lovers  of  the  Supreme
Lord, who regard Him as the most cherished objective of their existence  and
thus they are His elect. <i>Tyartham</i> means the most, even  beyond  description.
This love for the Supreme Lord Krishna is  so  deep  and  overflowing   that
even for Him as the Supreme Lord who is  omniscient  and  omnipotent  it  is
difficult to fathom. Such love for Him has no limitations assigned to it  as
evidenced in the case of Prahlad, the  pre-eminent  among  the  <i>jnani's</i>  who
although was persecuted many times to die on the order of his  demon;  never
was even slightly harmed, so  much  was  his  mind  blissfully  absorbed  in
devotion to  the  Supreme  Lord,  transported  by  the  rapture  induced  by
constant remembrance of Him. Such a  devotee  is  blissfully  loved  by  the
Supreme Lord as well in reciprocation.
