In the third chapter Lord Krishna explained that  only  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  the
performance  of  prescribed  Vedic   activities   was   suitable   for   the
materialistic person aspiring for <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from  the  cycle  of
birth and death and that such an aspirant was not competent  to  follow  the
path of <i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation  of  Vedic  knowledge.   It  was  also
shown that even for <i>jnana yoga</i> practitioners that <i>karma yoga</i> when  performed
as a matter of duty  <i>without</i>  attachment  was  preferable.  It  was  further
illustrated that for leaders of prominence in society  it  is  an  important
necessity to perform <i>karma yoga</i> in order  that  the  public  is  guided  and
inspired in a righteous manner. The objective of this fourth chapter  is  to
further emphasise the worthiness of <i>karma yoga</i> by giving  evidence  that  it
was taught to great personalities at the  beginning  of  this  <i>Manavatar</i>  or
cyclic appearance of one type of divine incarnations as  verified  in  Vedic
scriptures over a period of time comprising approximately every 350  million
years. Also it will be shown in this chapter how <i>karma yoga</i> partakes of  the
nature of <i>jnana yoga</i>  by  reason  of  spiritual  intentions  underlying  all
prescribed Vedic activities. Chapter four  finishes  up  by  explaining  the
nature  and  varieties  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  and  the  importance  of  spiritual
awareness connected to performing every action.
