Whatever body a <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  being  is  subjected  to  reside  in  and
whatever body they depart from; the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul  is  automatically
accompanied by the five senses and the  mind.  Lord  Krishna  explains  this
process as similar to  a  breeze  which  picks  up  the  scents  of  flowers
carrying them through through the air from one location to another.
