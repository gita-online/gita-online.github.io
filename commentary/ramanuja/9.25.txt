The word <i>vrata</i> means sacred resolve and  undertaking.  Those  whose  resolve
and willingness  to  perform  ceremonies  to  the  demigods  such  as  <i>darsa</i>
<i>purnamasa</i> for the full moon etc. desiring  entry  in  the  heavenly  planets
worship Indra the celestial chief and join him there.  Those  who  determine
to offer profuse ritualistic ablations in  honor  of  the  ancestors  go  to
<i>Pitriloka</i> the realm  of  the  ancestors.  Those  who  undertake  to  worship
demons, ghosts and spirits go to the  realms  of  the  respective  elemental
spirits of those invoked. But those who with devotion judiciously offer  all
propitiation and worship to the Supreme Lord Krishna who  exists  inside  as
<i>paramatma</i> the supreme soul and whose transcendental body  comprises  all  of
the demigods attains  the  Supreme  Lord  eternally.  The  votaries  of  the
demigods share the joys of the heavenly kingdoms for an  allotted  time  and
then they fall down but those  who  direct  their  rituals,  ceremonies  and
worship to the Supreme Lord. Who is without beginning, without end.  Who  is
omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent and infallible. Who is a vast  ocean  of
multitudinous attributes and infinite  glories.  Who  is  measureless  bliss
personified and from whom once attaining there is no return  to  the  worlds
of mortals. Next will be  given  another  distinguishing  characteristic  of
Lord Krishna's devotees.
