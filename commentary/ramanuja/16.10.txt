Lord Krishna uses the word <i>idam</i> meaning this. The <i>idam</i> He is  talking  about
refers to possessions such as wealth, property, family,  etc.  The  demoniac
mentality is that all my possessions have been acquired by me alone,  by  my
own efforts and exertions. They believe there is no other  power  or  subtle
unseen cause involved.  The  word  <i>manoratham</i>  means  desirable  object  and
whatever is  desirable  the  demoniac  feel  it  is  their  right  to  enjoy
regardless of morality. The wealth that they gain by  any  means  lawful  or
unlawful, or by cheating and stealing they see as moral and rightful  as  it
was gained by their own brain and brawn over others  brain  and  brawn.  The
demoniac follow the idea that might is right  and  do  not  believe  in  any
subjective force or higher power. They forcefully take whatever they  desire
and are totally unconcerned of  any  consequences,  oblivious  to  even  the
possibility that a god or supreme force sanctioning their  endeavours  could
exist. The demoniac feel that they are so powerful that they themselves  are
gods because they can destroy their enemies as a whim and consider  everyone
except themselves to be of unimportance.

The demoniac think like the following examples illustrate.  I  am  the  most
powerful. I was born into a dynasty of aristocracy and wealth. Who  else  in
this world is equal to  me?  Who  else  by  dint  of  their  exertions  have
acquired every pleasure there is to enjoy and secured so much happiness  and
stability? I will eat, drink and be merry, enjoying sense  gratification  to
the maximum without restraint. There is no need for me  to  believe  in  any
god or supreme power; but anyway I will  perform  some  pseudo  rituals  and
imitate some pious activities by ostentatious donations for charity to  gain
renown so others will think that I am also a great religious personality  as
well. This is how the demoniac think.

The demoniac see themselves  as  the  enjoyers,  the  manipulators  and  the
controllers, The demoniac believe that they are all  powerful,  independent,
masters of their own destines and independent  of  any  supreme  and  unseen
power; but so deluded are they that they completely ignore the reality  that
death  will  come  and  indiscriminately  abduct   them   from   all   their
possessions. This is mysteriously completely imperceptible to them.
