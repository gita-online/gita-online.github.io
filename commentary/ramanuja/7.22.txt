Whosoever then worships the demigods with unflinching faith which was
bequeathed by the Supreme Lord and constitute a portion of His body, will
certainly obtain their cherished desires; but such desires were sanctioned
and granted by the authority of the Supreme Lord. When a votary of the
demigods is engaged in ingratiating themselves into their good graces they
are oblivious to the reality that the demigods comprise the Supreme Lord's
body and that worship offered to them is actually in fact offerings
rendered to Him. But even though such worship is not directed towards
Himself, the Supreme Lord accepts such offerings as if they were to Him and
therefore grants the desires so longed for by the votary.
