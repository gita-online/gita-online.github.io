Previously in verse 61 Lord Krishna has declared  that  who  ever  meditates
exclusively on Him as the Lord of all, being the  soul  within  all  hearts,
then by this all impurities are  eradicated  and  the  mind  becomes  clear,
expunging all desires.  Here he says that the senses  become  destitute  and
barren of all cravings and aversions when they are mastered by the  mind  in
this manner. Rejecting all desires for sensual objects with  a  mind  firmly
under control, one achieves lucidity of mind along  with  inner  purity  and
blissfulness.
