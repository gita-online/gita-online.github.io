Lord Krishna begins this verse with  <i>sarvatah  pani-padam  tat</i>  meaning  the
Supreme Lords has hands and  feet  everywhere.  This  denotes  that  by  His
potency the Supreme Lord is capable of doing everywhere what all  hands  and
feet do in the embodied state. Similarly  He speaks <i>sarvatah  srutimal  loke</i>
meaning He hears everything in all  directions  internally  and  externally.
This denotes that He is capable of performing the functions  of  the  senses
such as hearing and seeing without the need of  any  physical  sense  organ.
The Supreme Lord known as <i>Parabrahman</i>  although  possessing  not  hands  and
feet is able to perform the activities of hands and feet.  The  Svetasvatara
Upanisad III.IXX beginning <i>apani pado jivana grihita</i> meaning:  Footless  and
handless He moves and grasps; eyeless and earless He sees  and  hears.  That
the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul of  every  sentient  being  even  situated  as  an
infinitesimal particle of <i>Parabrahman</i> also has the  capacity  of  performing
functions without organs as well. This is confirmed in the Mundaka  Upanisad
III.I.VIII beginning <i>tatha vidva punya-pape vidhuya niranjana  param  samyam</i>
<i>upaiti</i> means: The <i>atma</i> casting off the dross of merit  and  demerit  becomes
purified attaining qualitative sameness in transcendence as the <i>brahman.</i>  So
in conclusion the <i>ksetra-jna</i> abides  throughout  all  creation  encompassing
everything. This means  that  the  <i>atma</i>  pervades  all  things  in  creation
without exception for the <i>atma</i> has no limitations of  time  and  space.  The
<i>atma</i> is qualitatively equated  to   <i>Parabrahman</i>  but  quantitatively  it  is
minuscule similar to a ray of light from the sun.
