Lord Krishna uses the compound word <i>tad-buddhayas</i>  meaning  intelligence  in
the Supreme is referring to those who  have  their  intelligence,  intellect
and consciousness fixed in meditation of <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation  of  the
soul. The compound word <i>tad-atmanas</i> means with mind in  the  Supreme  refers
to those who make the <i>atma</i> or soul the singular focus of loving  reflection.
The intellect is merely the  machinations  of  the  mind  but  consciousness
includes emotion which facilitates loving devotion  within  the  heart.  The
compound word <i>tad-nisthas</i>  means  those  who  have  complete  faith  in  the
Supreme refers to those who enthusiastically follow the  Vedic  culture  and
perform all that is necessary to attain the Supreme. The compound word  <i>tat-</i>
<i>parayanah</i> means those whose sole noble aim is  devotion  to  the  <i>atma.</i>  The
cultivation  of  Vedic  knowledge  gradually  developes  consciousness   and
removes  all  taint  and  dross.  Those   possessing   the   before   stated
qualifications when perfecting them attain the  <i>atma</i>  which  is  irrevocable
and which  when  once  realised  insures  there  is  no  reverting  back  to
conditioned and restrictive levels of consciousness which are of the  nature
of nescience and ignorance.
