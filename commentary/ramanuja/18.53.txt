Lord Krishna and His manifestations are constantly in the  thoughts  of  His
devotees in His impersonal form  as  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence, as <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul pervading within  the
etheric hearts of all living entities simultaneously  and  in  His  original
two armed blackish form bedecked with peacock feather and attended by  flute
as well as in His authorised incarnations  and  expansions.  Dedicating  all
efforts and actions unto the Supreme Lord with devotion considering Him   as
the sole goal and ultimate reward constitutes the essence  of  consciousness
and the apex of attainment.
