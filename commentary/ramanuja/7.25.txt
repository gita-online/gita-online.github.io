Lord Krishna supreme nature is not easily perceptible to everyone because
even though He appears like an extraordinary human to mortals embedded in
samsara the endless cycle of birth and death which conditioned living
entities are accustomed too, the reality is Lord Krishna possesses an
immortal spiritual body that is immutable and eternal. Just because He
appears anthropomorphic the people of the world do not comprehend that His
avatars or incarnation are orchestrated in a numerous and regulated manner
with the express purpose to always be accessible to all. Albeit that Lord
Krishna's lilas or phenomenal  pastimes eclipse the pastimes of anything
heretofore witnessed as well as anything yet to be manifested. This
includes anything ever seen by the powerful forces of nature who are merely
His represented servants such as Vayu the demigod in charge of wind and
Indra the demigod in charge of rain, thunder and lightning. Lord Krishna's
lustrous glory dims the light of the sun from the sungod Surya and darkens
the glow of the fire of the firegod Agni; but the ignorant masses in this
world do not recognise Him because He appears in a humanlike form although
He is eternal and never subject to birth and death.
