The word <i>sankhya</i> means rational,  analytical  reasoning  and  refes  to  the
<i>sankhya</i> philosophy established  by  Lord  Krishna's  incarnation  of  Kapila
Deva. The word  <i>kritante</i>  means  deriving  the  perfect  conclusion  of  the
categorical and essential nature of  all  things  based  upon  the  tenents,
ordinances and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures.  The  five  causes  Lord
krishna will reveal are component factors combining to  manifest  individual
acts. The  word  <i>nibodha</i>  meaning  comprehend  denotes  that  they  must  be
contemplated and reflected  upon.  The  absolute  conclusion  of  the  Vedic
scriptures verily regards Lord Krishna's expansion as <i>paramatma</i> the  Supreme
Soul existing simultaneously in the etheric heart of all living entities  as
the sole author of all acts. The body, the <i>prana</i> or life airs, the ego,  the
senses, the are the four instuments of the <i>atma</i> or individual soul which  is
powered by <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul. Evidence confirming this is found  in
the Taittiriya Upanisad II.III.I beginning <i>prana deva anu prananti</i>  meaning:
That which is within the body is the <i>prana</i> and that which is  seated  within
the body is the  the  <i>atma</i>  and  that  which  rules  the  immortal  <i>atma</i>  is
<i>paramatma</i>.
