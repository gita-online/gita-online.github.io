Lord Krishna affirms that the aspirant  who  performs  renunciation  of  the
rewards of actions  and  the  aspirant  who  practices  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  or  the
cultivation of Vedic knowledge, for both of them <i>atma tattva</i> or  realisation
of the soul is difficult to achieve  without  the  help  of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or
performing prescribed Vedic  activities  without  desire  for  rewards.  The
compound words <i>yoga-yuktah</i> is  one  who  has  achieved  communion  with  the
ultimate  consciousness  by  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  performing  prescribed   Vedic
activities without attachment. The word <i>munir</i> or sagacious  is  one  who  is
focused on meditating on the <i>atma</i> or soul. Such a <i>muni</i> easily traverses  the
path of <i>karma yoga</i> receiving <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul as  well
as realisation of the <i>Brahman</i> or  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence. But the person who is inclined  to  perform  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  or  the
cultivation of Vedic knowledge finds this path extremely difficult and  hard
to maintain. Because of this it takes an exceptionally long time  to  attain
the <i>atma</i> by this discipline.
