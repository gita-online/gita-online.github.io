It should be clearly understood that whether confined to a physical body  or
a subtle body it is virtually impossible to  entirely  give  up  all  action
completely.  In the physical body  the  heart  is  beating,  the  lungs  are
breathing, water must be drunk, some form of nourishment must  be  ingested.
If it is a subtle body then sunshine must be absorbed  or  <i>prana</i>  or  energy
must be assimilated. These things are indispensable for life in  a  physical
or subtle body. Thus while residing in a physical  body  the  observance  of
prescribed Vedic activities are essential and must be performed. It  is  the
renouncing  of  desires  for  the  rewards  of  actions  that   is   factual
renunciation and not the mere abandoning of  activities.  Such  renunciation
also includes idea of authorship and the  bane  of  attachment.  It  may  be
argued  that  prescribed  Vedic  activities   have   rewards   automatically
associated with them such as entry to <i>Svarga</i>  the  heavenly  planets  so  by
such inseparable relationships they  are  clear  incentives.  This  is  also
applicable to the merits accrued from <i>nitya</i> or daily duties  and  <i>naimittika</i>
or occasional duties as well. These actions can be compared  to  planting  a
mango tree and the  fruits  can  be  considered  the  rewards  thereof.  But
motivation for the rewards of actions opposed to <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive  loving
devotion to Lord Krishna  and  is  inimical  to  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from
material existence. Verily this is true. So  all  rewards  whether   or  not
desirable or undesirable must be renounced  as  only   activities  performed
without motive and hankering for rewards are  to  be  enacted  and  this  is
actual renunciation.
