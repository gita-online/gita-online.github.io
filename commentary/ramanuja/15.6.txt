The <i>atma</i> or immortal soul within all <i>jivas</i> or  embodied  beings  constitutes
an eternal portion of Lord Krishna and thus is  also  eternal.  Yet  because
the <i>jiva</i> is inextricably emeshed in material existence from time  immemorial
it is enslaved by the nescience of its own <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  to  actions
and revolves incessantly in  <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetrual  cycle  of  birth  and
death. Precisely based on this <i>karma</i> a <i>jiva</i> is forced to accept  a  suitable
body such as a demigod, human, animal etc., attracting with it  five  senses
and a mind exactly appropriate to maximising the  chances  of  survival  for
such a  <i>jiva.</i>  But  when  the  <i>jiva</i>  through  association  of  the  Vaisnava
spiritual  master  becomes  enlightened   from   hearing   his   unequivocal
instructions and surrenders fully unto the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  as  one's
only refuge then Lord Krishna Himself releases the <i>jiva</i> from the bondage  of
<i>samsara</i> and the <i>jiva</i> becomes situated in <i>atma-tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation.
Other  than  taking  exclusive  shelter  of  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorised incarnations as revealed in Vedic sciptures it is impossible  for
the <i>jiva</i> which is  very  much  handicapped  in  terms  of  intelligence  and
potency to achieve <i>moksa</i> or liberation. This is due to the heavy  burden  of
unresolved <i>karma</i> attached to the jiva that they must carry  with  them  life
after life. But all actions performed for the satisfaction  of  the  Supreme
Lord have no <i>karma</i> attached to them. This is the difference.
