5 If the performance of  activities  for  the  Supreme  Lord  is  merely  an
exercise ordered by the mind for the body to enact then in no way
can it be considered <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving  devotion  as  it
being merely a dictate of the mind has no connection to the heart
and without passing through the heart there is no possibility  of
accessing the consciousness of the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul. The mind
however great it may be has no qualification  or  eligibility  to
access the <i>atma.</i> Thus it would behove an aspirant to  pursue  the
next alternative and  attempt to  develop  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation as instructed by Lord Krishna in verses III. IV and V
of this chapter. If after prolonged practice and attempts if <i>atna</i>
<i>tattva</i> does not arise  because  of  a  lack  of  inner  spiritual
development or due to  an  unstable  mind  easily  distracted  or
because of weakness in controlling the  senses  then  one  should
adopt themselves to the contemplation and reflection of the  <i>atma</i>
as delineated in chapter two as the  next  alternative.  If  even
this is to difficult to execute with regularity then  one  should
perform activities that please the Supreme Lord and renounce  the
desire for rewards for it. Such activities are  associating  with
His devotees and  rendering  service  to  them,  celebrating  the
appearance days of  Him  and  His  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and
fasting from all grains on <i>ekadasi</i> which is the 11th day  of  the
waxing and waning moon. Performing activities in this way without
any interest in receiving rewards and benefits will result in the
absence of all reactions and thus  the  cessation  of  all  sins.
Thereafter one will achieve peace of  mind  and  from  there  one
becomes a candidate for practising contemplation of the <i>atma</i>.  In
conclusion aspirants who  are  inept  at  performing  <i>bhakti</i>  are
encouraged to perform simpler methods which  will  step  by  step
gradually bring one up to that platform. Thus alternative methods
applicable for the inept who wish to evolve themselves have  been
succinctly enumerated.
