What is the <i>tad brahma</i> or the  supreme,spiritual  substratum  pervading  all
existence? What is <i>adhiyatma</i> or the soul within all  embodied  beings?  What
is <i>karma</i> or the equal reaction to any action? How is it possible  to  effect
<i>moksa</i> or liberation from the cycle of  birth  and  death  by  knowing  these
things and taking shelter of <i>Bhagavan</i> or the possessor  of  full  knowledge,
full power, full fame, full wealth, full beauty and full  renunciation,  who
is the Supreme Lord Krishna? What is the  <i>adhibhuta</i>  referring  to  embodied
beings and <i>adhidaivas</i> referring to  the  demigods  which  the  <i>atharthis</i>  or
seekers of wealth must know? What also is indicated by  the  term  <i>adhiyagna</i>
which all three  classes  of  aspirants  have  to  be  cognisant  of  beings
<i>atharthis, jijnasurs</i> or those  desiring  soul  realisation  and  <i>jnani's</i>  or
those  exclusively  seeking  the  Supreme  Lord  and  why  is  it  specially
characterised? Finally Arjuna wanted to know specifically  in  what  way  is
the Supreme Lord Krishna to be realised by persons of  controlled  mind  and
senses at the time of death.
