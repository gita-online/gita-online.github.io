As determined by the merits and demerits of  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  souls
<i>prakriti</i> or the  material  substratum  pervading  physical  existence  being
supervised by Lord  Krishna  manifests  all  moving  and  non-moving  living
entities as decreed by Lord Krishna according to their  <i>karma</i>  or  reactions
to past life actions. In this way conformable to the actions of all  created
beings does creation  revolve.  The  Vedic  scriptures  state:  The  Supreme
Lord's unequalled sovereign mastery, His infallible will and His  unexcelled
dominion over all  as  well  as  being  ever  free  of  reproach  for  being
unmerciful. This refers also to verse five of this chapter  with  the  words
<i>pasya me yogam aisvaram</i> or behold  my  super  extraordinary  potencies.  The
miracle worker who projects  all  the  cosmos  is  <i>maya</i>  the  Supreme  Lords
external  illusory  energy  which  is  contained  in   the   compound   word
<i>mayadhyaksena</i>  which  represents  Him.  What  else  is  <i>maya</i>  when  used  in
conjunction with the Supreme Lord other than His  <i>prakriti</i>  for  He  is  the
source of it.
