One who is unable to concentrate and focus their mind in meditation on  Lord
Krishna is known  as  <i>ayukta</i>  devoid  of  spiritual  intelligence.  One  who
attempts to control their senses by their own efforts without  securing  the
grace of the Supreme Lord merited by devotion. To these living  entities  no
clear, definitive illumination in consciousness can develop; ergo ,  because
one will not be able to internally  realise  the  ultimate  reality  of  the
Supreme Lord through the medium of the eternal soul as  having  name,  form,
qualities, pastimes, abode  and  sweetness.   Thus  without  being  able  to
comprehend and contemplate on the nature of the eternal soul  there  can  be
no tranquillity. Nor is it  possible  to  dispel  the  compulsive  urge  and
inclination to experience sensual objects. To those who  are  not  tranquil,
who are  addicted  to  sensual  objects  and  who  are  submerged  in  sense
gratification; how can they ever possibly  attain  eternal  blessedness  and
transcendental  bliss.  Again  as  stated  previously  are   the  disastrous
consequences that result in the inability to govern the tempestuous senses.
