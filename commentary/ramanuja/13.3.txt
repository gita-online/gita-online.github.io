Now Lord Krishna  is  more  explicitly  explaining  details  about  the  <i>tat</i>
<i>ksetram</i> or field of activity.  Its  <i>yadrik  ca</i>  or  its  substantial  nature
regarding its use and function and its  purpose.  Also  its  <i>yad  vikari</i>  or
transformations and modifications along with its <i>yatas</i>  or  from  whence  it
came meaning its origin and how it  was  created  and  for  whose  use.  Yat
refers to its attributes and qualities. Also He is inferring that  knowledge
about the intrinsic nature of the <i>ksetra-jna</i>  as the knower  of  the  <i>ksetra</i>
which is the <i>atma</i> or eternal soil will be revealed as well  along  with  its
inherent potencies which is confirmed  by  the  word  <i>prabhavas  ca</i>  meaning
virtues, potency and powers. Lord Krishna will give a summary of  all  these
things.
