Lord Krishna expounds here that some humans having become  perfect  in  <i>yoga</i>
or the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion with  the
ultimate consciousness; perceive by the lucidness of their mind the <i>atma</i>  or
immortal soul within the physical body by means of  <i>dhyanena</i>  or  devotional
meditation. Others who are novice in <i>yoga</i> develop their minds  by  <i>jnana</i>  or
Vedic knowledge and <i>sankhyena</i> or subtle discrimination  between  spirit  and
matter and applying it diligently soon perceive the  <i>atma</i>  as  well.   Still
others who are unfit for the regiment of  <i>jnana yoga</i> and those who  are  fit
but prefer an easier method and those whose duty it is  to  set  an  example
for the common man; they all follow the path of <i>karma yoga</i> or  the  path  of
actions devoted to the Supreme Lord that embody devotion and training  their
minds to control the  senses  become  established  in  <i>yoga</i>  and  eventually
perceive the <i>atma</i> also.
