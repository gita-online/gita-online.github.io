Now the journey which is known as <i>archir-adi</i>  or  the  path  beginning  with
light which is common to the <i>jijnasur</i> the knower  of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation as well as the <i>bhakta</i> or loving devotee  of  the  <i>parama  purusa</i>
the supreme personality. The Vedic scriptures declare  that  the  <i>archir-adi</i>
is the path by which both these types of aspirants travel  at  the  time  of
death. It is the road travelled by  which  there  is  no  returning  to  the
worlds of mortals. The Vedic  scriptures  when  explaining  <i>panca-agni-vidya</i>
the system of the five fires states: Those who have  realised  the  atma  or
soul, those who meditate on the Supreme Lord  with  full  faith,  those  who
worship the Supreme Lord with bhakti or loving devotion. Those who do  these
activities alone in a private place reach the  archi  the  deity  of  light,
from there to the deity of day etc. as explained in the  Chandogya  Upanisad
V.II-XV beginning tad ya ittham vidur. One  who  travels  by  the  archi-adi
path reaches Parabrahma the supreme  being  and  thus  returns  not  to  the
material worlds. This  is  confirmed  in  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  IV.XV.IV
beginning enan Brahma gamayati which states: He the servitor  named  Amanava
to the appropriate demigod, escorts the souls who  have  achieved  moksa  or
liberation from material existence to Brahmaloka  from  where  they  are  no
longer subjected to reincarnation in samsara the perpetual  cycle  of  birth
and death.

Those who have realised the atma are not in the same category as those
aspirants who diligently practice the para-vidya the supreme knowledge
declared by Brahma because success in that is determined first by atma
tattva or soul realisation. Otherwise if there was no difference between
the two then it would have been unnecessary for Lord Krishna to mention the
path leading to rebirth and the path leading to no rebirth. The Chandogya
Upanisad V.IX.I states: Thus do the waters come to be designated as the
Purusa in the fifth oblation. Those who have performed righteous deeds and
those who have performed abominable deeds receive physical forms in
conjunction and accordance with these activities and are fashioned out of
the five elements in which water is predominant. The atma is not these
forms but just embodied in these forms by the dictates of karma or
reactions from past actions. So this is the distinction and those who
understand the reality of atma in this way qualify for the archi-adi and
achieving moksa or liberation no longer return to the realms of mortal
existence. The conclusive understanding is that non-intelligent nature
being material like the physical body is always fit to be discarded and the
intelligent nature being spiritual like the atma is always fit to be
embraced. Those who follow the spiritual   nature and realise the atma
travel the path of archi-adi and return not to samsara the perpetual cycle
of birth and death.

The previous passage that the servitor Amanava escorts the souls to
Brahmaloka is applicable to both the followers of the spiritual nature
being the jijnasuh or the soul seeker and the jnani the god seeker, as the
meditation of the former consists of reflecting on the atma, devoid of
matter without any material conceptions as being one with the brahman or
the spiritual substratum pervading all existence,. This conforms with the
Vedic axiom known as tat krata-nyaya or that similar efforts yield similar
results; therefore when realisation of the brahman is the focus of one's
aspirations then one devotes themselves to contemplation of the brahman. So
the realisation of the brahman is achieved by dint of the aspirants
contemplation on the brahman. How exactly is the jijnasur to contemplate
the brahman is that they look at the brahman as ancillary to the atma which
is the primary goal. Whereas the jnani meditates on the brahman as the
effulgence of the Supreme Lord Himself and looks at the atma as ancillary
to that, the Supreme Lord being the primary goal. Giving credence to the
fact that the atma or soul is in reality part and parcel of the eternal
ultimate Supreme Being as well as the brahman is verified in the Brihad-
aranyaka Upanisad V.VII.XXII beginning ya atmani tisthan which states: The
brahman abides in the atma, by whom the atma is the body.
