In the previous chapter the Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  the  possessor  of  all
divine attributes as well as countless exalted qualities such  as  an  ocean
of mercy, compassion, affability, omniscience etc. and  the  source  of  all
<i>avatars</i> or  incarnations  and  expansions,  being  the  ultimate  object  of
worship to all who aspire  for  the  path  of  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving
devotion unto the Supreme Lord Krishna;  revealed  His  unlimited  sovereign
power of  universal  dominion  in  the  form  of  His  <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine
universal form after being requested by His  devotee  Arjuna.  It  has  also
been established that uninterrupted profound, sublime <i>bhakti</i>  alone  without
cessation is the only possible way  to  realise  the  Supreme  Lord  in  His
ultimate nature and experience communion with Him. Now in this  chapter  the
following three realities will be examined.
1) The inherent superiority  of  an  aspirant  performing  <i>bhakti</i>  involving
meditation  directly  upon  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself  as  compared  to
meditation upon the <i>atma</i> or the eternal soul which  only  leads  to  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the soul in order to attain the ultimate goal of
all existence. This  superiority  of  <i>bhakti</i>  is  measured  in  terms  of
absolute fulfilment of the ultimate goal and in the sublime felicity  and
bliss of performance. <i>Bhakti</i> or love  of  God  is  considered  the  fifth
<i>purusharthas</i> above the other four ambitions of humans beings which are 1.
<i>Dharma</i> or righteousness which consists  of  two  parts  first  being  the
regular performance of Vedic activities and the second  being  performing
actions which benefit all living entities such as freely providing  fresh
water and salt to all and  protecting  against  all  demoniac  influences
whenever they appear. 2. <i>Artha</i> or the  righteous  acquirement  of  wealth
according to the Vedic scriptures without usury or deception. 3. <i>Kama</i>  or
enjoyment and pleasure in the  material  existence  following  the  Vedic
scriptures without perversion or degradation. 4. <i>Moksa</i> or liberation from
material existence by <i>atma tattva</i> or liberation from  material  existence
by <i>bhakti</i> realising the Supreme Lord direct. It should be noted that <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> is automatically an inherent part of <i>bhakti</i> and thus those blessed
living entities who perform <i>bhakti</i> to the Supreme Lord Krishna or any  of
His authorised <i>avatars</i> do not have to make any separate or special effort
to achieve this.
2) The method of realising the Supreme Lord will be given in verse two.
3) The <i>aksaram</i> or abstract, impersonal unmanifest path  examined  in  verses
3,4,5 is applicable  for  those  who  are  inept  and  unqualified.  This
ineptitude and lack of qualification is due  to  the  absence  of  humbly
approaching a spiritual master from one of the four  authorised  Vaisnava
<i>sampradaya's</i> or empowerd lines of disciplic succession  and  after  being
accepted by him and initiated being taught the fundamentals of <i>bhakti.</i>
<p>
The superiority of <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna is made manifest by the superiority of He, Himself being the  object
of such loving devotion. This maxim of superiority  was  briefly  stated  by
Lord Krishna in chapter six verse 47 where  He  states  :  Those  with  firm
faith in the Vedic scriptures describing  super-excellent  devotion  to  Him
and with hearts  full  of  love  dedicate  all  their  actions  to  Him  are
<i>yuktatamah</i> the most superior of all.
<p>
The words <i>satata-yuktah</i> meaning always engaged denotes ever  devout  towards
the  Supreme  Lord  being  ever  intent  on  communion  with  Him  which  is
continuing the sentiments of the last verse in chapter 11.  The  words  <i>tvam</i>
<i>paryupasate</i> means direct worship of Lord Krishna and refers to  deeming  the
Supreme Lord as the complete fulfilment of one's every ambition and  desire.
The Supreme Lord, the perfect, infallible one, the  Sovereign  Lord  of  all
creation  and  the  refuge  of  all  cosmic  glories,  possessing  unlimited
attributes of exalted qualities such as divinity,  omniscience,  compassion,
omnipotence, etc.  Such  ones  are  thy  eternal  adorers  and  always  your
beloved.
<p>
Those other votaries  are  the  worshippers  of  the  abstract,  impersonal,
<i>avyaktam</i> or unmanifest and imperceptible. which is <i>aksaram</i> or  imperishable.
Such also reflect and contemplate upon the  nature  of  the  <i>pratyagatma</i>  or
individual soul which is imperishable also as well as  being  unmanifest  in
as much as it is indiscernible by the mind and imperceptible to any  of  the
senses such as the eye or ear, etc.
<p>
Of these two classes of aspirants which one is superior  and  most  suitable
for  performing  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the  individual   consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate  consciousness.  Inferring  which  one
would achieve their respective  goals most expediently. In verse seven  Lord
Krishna gives the definitive reply in answer to  this  query  by  succinctly
revealing the most expeditious way to attain the ultimate goal.
