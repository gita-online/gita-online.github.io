Dedicate thy mind and all activities to  the  Supreme  Being  in  the  heart
represented by the eternal <i>atma</i> or soul within all living beings.  The  word
<i>nirasih</i> means desireless. Being free from desires and  free  from  hankering
for the rewards  of  all  actions  while  evicting  all  vanity.   The  word
<i>nirmamah</i>  means without a sense of ego. Prohibiting all ego constructs of I-
ness and my-ness and relieved from the fever of mental  delusion,  discharge
the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures according to your  qualification  at
once as a matter of  duty  without  attachment.  In  this  Lord  Krishna  is
instructing the warrior prince Arjuna how he should fight his enemies.

The words <i>adhyatma-cetasa</i> means with the mind absorbed in  the  <i>atma</i>  within
the heart. One's thoughts should be focused on the nature of the  soul,  its
attributes and qualities as delineated previously in chapter two, verses  13
- 25. There are many scriptures that reveal some of the  attributes  of  the
<i>atma.</i> In the Taittiriya Upanisad we find: Enveloped within the  interior  of
the heart, the ruler of all beings, the eternal  Supersoul,  the  origin  of
all. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad we find:  He  who  is  residing  in  the
<i>atma,</i> He who is interior to the <i>atma,</i> He whom the <i>atma</i> knows  not,  He  whom
the <i>atma</i> knows not, He who rules from the interior of the <i>atma,</i>  He  who  is
the indwelling monitor, He who is the giver of immortality,  He  whose  body
constitutes the <i>atma</i> of all living beings, He who is the knower of  all  and
is the inner guide to all.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Therefore we see  that  by  inference  that  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is
revealing that since He is the <i>atma</i> within all living beings and  that  also
the <i>atma</i> within all created beings constitute  His  eternal,  transcendental
body and derive all their energy from Him;  then  it  is  natural  that  one
should dedicate all their actions to Lord Krishna, the Supreme Being  as  an
act of <i>yagna</i> or worship.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
One should very reverently reflect that one's <i>atma</i> is a part of the  Supreme
Lord and therefore He is within me and I am within  Him.  The  Supreme  Lord
Krishna is the Lord and Master of all. It is He alone  who  causes  acts  of
<i>yagna</i> to be performed by me to  Him  and  therefore  I  am  His  instrument.
Therefore no  conceptions  of  I-ness  or  my-ness,  or  authorship  can  be
accepted by me for any actions that are performed. Thus I will be free  from
the fever of mental delusion fuelled by the fire of illusion.

The <i>Paramapurusa</i> is  the  Supreme  Being  and  <i>Sarveshvara</i>  is  the  Supreme
Controller. In  the  Svetavatara  Upanisad  VI.VII  we  find:  Let  us  take
complete shelter of the Omnipotent Supreme Lord, the Supreme Lord  over  all
lords, the Supreme Ruler of all rulers, the Supreme Master of  all  masters.
The word <i>isvaratva</i> means lordship and the word <i>niyantritva</i> means  ruler  and
the word <i>patitva</i> means master denoting the relationship between the  Supreme
Lord and His servitors. In the Narayana Upanisad we find: He is the  Supreme
Lord of the universe. In the Brahma  Samhita  V.I  we  find  <i>isvarah  parama</i>
<i>krishna</i> which means that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Controller.

Arjuna was also reflecting on how he would become free from the myriad's  of
sins about to be committed by him in the battle  for  all  the  warriors  he
would be slaying.  Now he is being instructed to cheerfully begin  the  fray
performing his prescribed duties as <i>yagna</i> or worship in <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  the
path of prescribed Vedic activities  without  attachment  according  to  the
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures. By dedicating oneself according to  the
edicts of the Vedic scriptures  one  is  actually  worshipping  the  Supreme
Being and the person who performs their activities in this  ordained  manner
is automatically exempt from all reactions  as  the  Supreme  Being  Himself
accepts their actions  of  offerings  as  His  own  and  accepting  complete
responsibility  of  His  surrendered  devotee  factually  frees  them   from
bondage. Thus the quintessence of all the Upanisads has been duly given.
