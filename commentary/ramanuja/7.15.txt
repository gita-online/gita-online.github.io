If one were to ask why do not  all  intelligent  beings  swiftly  adopt  and
follow the path of surrender and devotion to the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and
receive the highest benefit the answer is given in this verse  by  the  word
<i>duskritno</i> or miscreants of evil and wicked deeds all of whom fall  into  one
of four categories.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>mudhahs</i>  are  the  grossly  ignorant  who  have   wrong   and   perverted
understanding, who think that what is the  Supreme  Lord's  such  as  all
creation they consider to be their own.
<p>
<i>1) naradhamah</i> are the ignoble members of society who although knowing of
the Supreme Lord glory disdain to offer Him respect and homage in
reciprocation with Him.
<i>2) mayayapahrta</i> are those who forfeited the correct knowledge of the
Supreme Lord acquired previously due to irrelevant and irreverent
speculative, logistical analysis.
<i>3) asuram bhavam asritah</i>  are those of demoniac mentality who knowing the
power and glory of the Supreme Lord are only incited to cultivate deep
seeded enmity against Him.
<p>
In the order presented, each subsequent miscreant is more sinful then the
previous before it.
