Whosoever without first  unburdening  themselves  of  all  their  sins,  who
without having first gained mastery  of  their  senses  and  without  having
first achieved self-control of the  mind.  If  such  a  person  pretends  to
strives  for  <i>atma-tattva</i>  or  self-realisation  of  the  soul,  with  their
thoughts dwelling on sense objects due to attachment  for  them  instead  of
focusing on the eternal soul. Then the conduct of such a one  is  duplicious
and false and they are a charlatan. Any person acting in this  way  is  only
deceiving themselves by their own deception and surely  will  never  succeed
in realising the eternal soul.
