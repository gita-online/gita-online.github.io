It is due to the loving compassion felt by  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  for
those persons who dedicate and devote their lives to Him that He  is  always
manifest in their  hearts  and  minds  as  the  paramount  object  of  their
thoughts and plans and activities, accompanied by  the  realisation  of  His
transcendental qualities and attributes. The words <i>jnana-dipena</i> meaning  the
radiant light of knowledge is verily  Lord  Krishna  Himself  in  all  their
thoughts.  <i>Tamah</i>  or  the  darkness  of  ignorance  to  which   beings   are
continuously subjected to is due to past and present <i>karma</i> or the  reactions
to one's actions.  This  <i>tamah</i>  and  <i>karma</i>  are  extremely  antagonistic  to
spiritual intelligence and  produce  the  desire  for  things  material  and
temporary instead of  things  spiritual  and  eternal  which  lead  to  Lord
Krishna; but for His devotees He dispels their  <i>tamah</i>  and  dissolves  their
<i>karma.</i> Having comprehended the qualities, attributes and  character  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna regarding His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  phenomenal,  transcendental
potencies manifesting throughout  all  of  creation  and  His  <i>yoga</i>  or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  His
ultimate  consciousness,  eternally.  This  knowledge   will   mature   into
appreciation which will evolve into <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion  for
Him and subsequently unlimited bliss will naturally arise within the  hearts
and minds of His devotees.
