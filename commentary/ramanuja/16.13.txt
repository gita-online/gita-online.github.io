Here Lord Krishna describes more telltale signs and characteristics  of  the
demoniac.
The word <i>ahankara</i> means egotistic  thinking  they  are  independent  of  the
Supreme Lord
The word <i>darpam</i> means insolence,  thinking  that  they  as  demons  are  all
important.
<i>Pradvishantah</i>  means  despise,  the  envious  demoniac  openly  despise  the
Supreme Lord.
<p>
Even though the Supreme Lord is <i>atma-para-devesu</i>  or  situated  within  them
and  all  living  entities  as  the  immortal  supreme  soul,  the  demoniac
endeavour in earnest most spitefully to cause great evil to  all  creatures.
The demoniac  exhibit  overt  malice  and  aggressiveness  against  anything
righteous and determinedly oppose the Supreme Lord at every  opportunity  in
every way  they  can.  They  take  great  pains  to  degrade  moral  values,
encourage depraved activities and destroy the family  unit.  They  propagate
that god does not exist,  that  creation  came  from  a  random  mixture  of
chemicals and that there is nothing  existing  after  this  life  so  it  is
better to eat, drink and be  merry  without  cessation.  They  concoct  many
doctrines, conduct many seminars and establish many schools  of  thought  to
negate the idea of the existence of  a  singular  consciousness,  a  Supreme
being or Supreme Lord that is the creator  and  supreme  controller  of  all
creation. This is the demoniacs gross folly and  unredeemable  sin  is  that
they despise the Supreme Lord Krishna  who  is  the  origin  of  their  very
existence  and  the  creator   of   the   complete   cosmic   and   material
manifestations.
