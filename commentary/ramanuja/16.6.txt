The demoniac declare that creation is <i>asatyam</i> or unreal  and  that  creation
is not an effect of  anything.  The  demoniac  state  that  creation  exists
without any <i>aparaspara</i> or cause.  The  demoniac  propund  that  creation  is
without  <i>apratistham</i>  or  any  support,  maintenance  or  foundation.    The
demoniac postulate that creation is <i>anisvaram</i> without any controller and  is
godless. But the fact exists that after  manifesting  creation  the  Supreme
Lord places it on the hood of Sesa Naga as confirmed  in  the  Visnu  Purana
II.V.XXVII beginning <i>ten eyam naga varenya sirasa  vidhirita  mahi</i>  stating:
Creation rests on the hood of Sesa Naga, which in turn  supports  the  chain
of spheres in the material worlds which is the abode  of  demigods,  humans,
beasts and demons.

The demoniac have also concocted theories which  they  strictly  adhere  and
propagate. They hypothecate that creation is not under the  auspices  of  or
created  by  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  who   is   eternal,   infallible,
omnipotent, omniscient, omni-present and who is the  Supreme  controller  of
everything. Their only evidence is that everywhere they look they  see  male
and  females  of  such  and  such  species  cohabitating  to  continue   the
preservation of that species and  hence  they  have  concluded  that  sexual
passion alone is the cause  that  propels  mutual  union  between  male  and
female and evolves creation.
