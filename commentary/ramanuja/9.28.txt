The  words  <i>sannyasa-yoga</i>  means  the  individual  consciousness   attaining
communion with theultimate consciousness by the  complete  surrendering  and
offering of everything one has and is unto the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.  One
whose nature has found refuge in  such  inner  resignation  is  known  as  a
<i>yuktatma</i> or a renunciate of the eternal soul. Thus constantly meditating  on
the <i>atma</i> or soul as being the eternal part of  themselves  and  the  Supreme
Lord and realizing that they are totally under His control they perform  all
actions whether they are natural, scriptural, daily or occasional as  direct
intended propitiation to Him. Thus thinking and acting in this way they  are
released from the fetters of all <i>karma</i> or  reactions  to  actions  from  the
immeasurable past which barricades the path  leading  to  the  Supreme  Lord
from time immemorial and being freed from them attain the eternal  spiritual
worlds  in  association  with  the  Supreme  Lord.  Next  here   about   His
transcendental and paramount nature beyond the sway of material nature.
