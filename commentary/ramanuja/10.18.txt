Within the etheric hearts of all living entities is enthroned  the  <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul  which  comprises  the  spiritual  body  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna. To be the eternal <i>atma</i> is to be in every respect the  support,  the
ruler and controller of the living entities and to be blessed with the  <i>atma</i>
is to be eternally connected to the Supreme  Lord  lifetime  after  lifetime
forever. The Brihadaranya Upanisad V.VII.XV beginning <i>yas sarvashu  bhuteshu</i>
<i>tishthan sarvebhyo bhutebhyo</i> states: He who is enthroned  in  the  heart  of
all beings, Who is the innermost of all beings, Whom  all  the  beings  know
not, Whom all beings form His spiritual body, Who rules the interior of  all
beings, is the <i>atma,</i> the <i>antaryami</i> the immortal inner  ruler.  In  the  same
Upanisad V.VII.XXII beginning <i>ya atmani tisthan atmano</i> it states: He who  is
enthroned within the <i>atma,</i> Who resides within  the  interior  of  the  <i>atma,</i>
Whom even the <i>atma</i> does not know, Whom all <i>atma's</i> are  the  spiritual  body,
Who rules the interior of the <i>atma</i> is <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme <i>atma</i> of all.  So
enthroned as such within the <i>atma</i> of all living entities  as  <i>paramatma</i>  the
Supreme Lord is the beginning, the middle and the  end  of  all  beings  and
their cause, their evolution and their dissolution.

So now that it has been shown how the Supreme Lord  abides  within  all  His
manifested beings as the <i>atma</i> and how all terms regarding the <i>atma</i> in  their
ultimate  reference  <i>samanadhi-karanya</i>  which  means  two  or   more   terms
signifying different ideas but referring to a singular object  connotes  the
Supreme Lord Himself. Such references concerning  the  relationship  between
the Supreme Lord and His manifested creation will  be  illustrated  by  many
notable examples. Verily only then do  all  such  terms  have  the  ultimate
connotation as referring to the Supreme Lord when He is residing  within  as
the eternal <i>atma.</i> For example the terms  of  demigod,  human,  animal,  tree
etc. although denotative of the corporeal exterior, is  connotative  of  the
eternal soul which indwells within  those  exterior  forms.  The  same  rule
holds true in regard to terms ultimately connotative  in  referring  to  the
Supreme Lord in His aspect as the eternal  soul  of  all  living  things  as
well. Movable or immovable nothing exists without the Supreme  Lord  Krishna
and so all are dependent upon the Him.
