Undoubtedly prescribed Vedic activities are conducive to achieving <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation form material existence but as  they  also  include  penance  and
austerities  they  may  cause  discomfort,  difficulty  and  even  pain   to
accomplish. Sometimes fasting is required putting the  physical  body  under
duress causing fatigue  which  is  agonising  to  the  mind.  Dreading  such
inconvenience one may limit themselves solely to  the  practice  of  <i>astanga</i>
<i>yoga</i> with its numerous exercises, or  <i>pranayama</i>  maintaining  strict  breath
control or sit for long hours in meditation to achieve <i>moksa.</i> All  of  these
activities may have merit but if they keep one  refraining  from  performing
prescribed Vedic activities and obligatory duties then  such  abstention  is
known to be contrary to the conclusions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  and  is
situated in <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion.  The  benefits  that  one  thinks
they are gaining by abstaining from prescribed Vedic activities  to  perform
other works are factually never  accrued.  It  is  just  a  figment  of  the
imagination like  a  mirage  for  without  supplicating  everything  to  the
Supreme Lord Krishna through the medium of the bonfide spiritual  master  in
disciplic succession it is not possible to receive  His  grace.  This  topic
will be addressed further in verse 32.
