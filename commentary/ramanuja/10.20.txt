Lord Krishna reveals that among the  four  Vedas,  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine,
transcendental  opulence  is  the  Sama  Veda,  of  all  the  demigods   His
<i>vibhuti</i> is the celestial chief Indra. Of the 11  senses  called  <i>indriyannam</i>
being seeing, hearing, tatsing,  touching  and  smelling  which  corresponds
respectively to the eyes, ears, tongue, skin and nose with  the  11th  being
the mind which as the chief of them all is  Lord  Krishna  <i>vibhuti.</i>  Of  all
living  beings  whatever  consciousness  arises  within  them   apart   from
intelligence that is also His vibhuti.
