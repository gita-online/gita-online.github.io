If  one  is  still  unable  to  constantly  endeavour  to  perform  repeated
concentration upon Lord Krishna then one should  at  least  try  to  perform
activities  in  His  service  whenever  possible  such  as  cow  protection,
construction of Vedic temples to house His deity forms,  maintaining  flower
gardens for His worship, cultivation of fruit and vegetable gardens for  His
service, etc. Also in included in these  activities  is  visiting  His  holy
pastime places and hearing about  them,  perambulating  His  holy  <i>dhama</i>  or
abodes in India, prostrating before Him, singing and  dancing  in  glory  to
Him, etc. All these activities for Lord Krishna  should  be  performed  with
causeless,  ardent  affection  in  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving   devotion.
Performing such activities exclusively for the satisfaction of  the  Supreme
Lord prepares the mind for constant remembrance and subsequent  fixed  focus
on Him without deviation.
