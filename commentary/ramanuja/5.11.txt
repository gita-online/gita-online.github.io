The word <i>yuktah</i> means united with  renunciation.  It  can  also  denote  not
wanting any reward other than realisation of the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul,  both  are
meritorious  and  distinguished  performance  of  actions.  Such  a   person
relinquishes the desire for rewards for actions  and  instead  utilises  all
actions for the purpose of self purification soon attaining <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul and the eternal beatitude  of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
from the  material  existence.  The  word  <i>ayuktah</i>  means  not  united  with
renunciation and is unmeritorious and degraded. It can also denote  desiring
mundane material rewards not connected to the <i>atma.</i> Incited by cravings  one
lustfully desires the rewards of all actions. The actions of such  a  person
perpetually binds them to captivity in <i>samsara</i> or the  cycle  of  birth  and
death in material existence. Hence that  person  who  is  completely  weaned
from all attachment to the rewards of their actions is able to delegate  all
their actions as a product of material nature manifesting itself in form  of
the senses and their sense objects. This discernment facilitates the  <i>atma's</i>
deliverance and redemption from material bondage.  Next  Lord  Krishna  will
show how the agency of action can be designated to the physical body  as  an
aggregate of matter.
