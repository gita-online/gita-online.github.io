One who is following <i>karma yoga</i>  or  prescribed  Vedic  activities  and  has
achieved <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul  will  not  desire  anything
else other than the bliss of the <i>atma</i> or soul.   In  this  position  one  is
almost oblivious of the external world and has no urge  to  crave   or  hate
anything and thus is also able to endure the dualities seeing  them  all  as
the same. Such a person is known to be constantly situated in <i>jnana yoga</i>  or
the cultivation of Vedic knowledge by  every  activity  and  is  incessantly
experiencing the bliss of the  <i>atma.</i>  Lord  Krishna  confirms  that  such  a
person easily performs <i>karma yoga</i> without effort and transcends  <i>samsara</i>  or
the cycle of birth and death. That both <i>karma yoga</i> and the renunciation  for
the rewards of actions which is included in <i>jnana yoga</i>  are  both  competent
to give <i>atma tattva</i> is shown next.
