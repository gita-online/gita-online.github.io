As in this world and all over the material creation there is nothing more
purifying and sanctifying then the spiritual knowledge of atma tattva or
soul realisation it is the destructive of all sin. Perfecting oneself by
the easy practice of karma yoga or the following of prescribed Vedic
activities in the manner instructed by the self-realised spiritual master
one will naturally attain atma tattva as well in due course of time.
