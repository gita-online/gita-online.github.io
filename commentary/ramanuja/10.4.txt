The subjects discussed here are the descriptions of mental states and  imply
the state of mind arising from activities designated by these  dispositions.
Such temperaments are the active and passive expressions which give  impetus
to engage in activities or lethargy  to  remain  passive  and  refrain  from
engaging in activities. Yet all these mental states are  bequeathed  by  the
Supreme Lord to each of them according to  merit  accrued.  The  next  verse
will explain the active agents involved  in  the  creating,  sustaining  and
preservation of all of creation as  all  beings  in  all  existences  derive
their impulses solely from the will and desire of Lord Krishna.
