By putting full trust and faith  in  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  under  the
guidance  of  a  bonfide  spiritual  preceptor   in   authorised   disciplic
succession from one of the four channels of spiritual empowerment  even  the
lowest born <i>mleechas</i> or meateater who are lower then untouchables,  who  are
lower then <i>sudras</i> the servant class who are lower than <i>vaisyas</i> the  business
class, who are lower then women all can qualify  themselves  to  attain  the
supreme destination of the eternal spiritual worlds and eternal  association
with the Supreme Lord. If such is so then Brahmins and Vaisnavas as well  as
royal sages and kings who are devoted to  serving  Lord  Krishna  with  love
attaining this blessed state need not ever by questioned. The  word  <i>asukham</i>
meaning miserable is used to remind one that human  life  is  stricken  with
the irrevocable three  fold  afflictions  of  old  age,  disease  and  death
applicable to everyone. Also everyone is forced to suffer  from  afflictions
self caused, afflictions from interacting in the world and from  afflictions
manifesting from beyond this world. Thus since all humans  are  existing  in
this world and are sentient beings endowed by Lord Krishna with an  <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul to  attain  this  blessed  supreme  destination,  then  without
question all human beings should fully worship and propitiate Lord  Krishna.
