Lord Krishna declaration of: many births have past for you and for Me  is  a
definite  affirmation  of  the  reality  of  reincarnation  for  Arjuna  and
confirmation of the <i>avatars</i> or incarnations of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
What He is confirming  is  that  His  present  incarnation  is  as  real  as
Arjuna's present life reincarnation and that the  ones  from  the  past  are
real as well,  subtly  implying  that  there  is  a  fundamental  difference
between them.  The nature of  the  <i>avatars,</i>  how  they  manifest  and  their
purpose for incarnating is given next.
