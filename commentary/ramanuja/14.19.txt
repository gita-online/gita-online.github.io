Thus by eating foods situated in <i>sattva guna</i> or the mode  of  goodness  such
as milk, cream, butter, fruits, rice, grains and vegetables  and  performing
activities exclusively for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord  Krishna  or
any of  His  55  authorised  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and  do  this  never
considering renumeration  or  rewards  has  been  duly  delineated  by  Lord
Krishna Himself. Then all traces  and  residue  of  <i>raja  guna</i>  or  mode  of
passion and <i>tama guna</i> or mode of ignorance will be completely dissolved  and
eradicated. When the aspirant becomes knowledgeable  in  the  mechanisms  of
the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature and realises that they  actually
are  performing  all  actions  themselves  according  to  their   respective
qualities,then they see that they are not the doer but  only  the  observer.
When such a one further  perceives  the  localised  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul
within the etheric heart as being eternally  a  part  of  <i>paramatma</i>  or  the
Supreme Soul within the etheric heart of all sentient beings  everywhere  in
creation; then one attains a state of consciousness like  unto  the  Supreme
Lord. The understanding is that the <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul  is  eternal  and
transcendental to all aspects of material nature  and  thus  free  from  any
influence or <i>karma</i> or reactions to actions that may  come  to  the  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being due to its association with the three <i>gunas</i>  within  material
existence.  The  <i>atma</i>  itself  is  of  the  nature  of  infinite   expanding
consciousness. All <i>atmas</i> are feminine and when the  <i>atma</i>  is  thus  realised
then a <i>jiva</i> qualifies to have eternal association in the  spiritaual  worlds
with Lord Krishna. This is what He means by the  words  <i>mad  bhavan</i>  meaning
attains a consciousness like Mine. So  in  conclusion  after  cognising  and
realising the absolute nature of the actionless  <i>atma</i>  which  is  completely
beyond the purview of the material the assocaiation of the Supreme  Lord  is
attained.
