The actions enacted by  mind,  speech  and  body  which  are  righteous  and
meritorious are those that are sanctioned by  the  Vedic  scriptures.  Those
actions  which  are  unrighteous  and  unmeritorious  are  those  that   are
prohibited and those not prescribed in the Vedic scriptures.
<p>
In all actions of any nature whether pertaining to mind, speech or body  the
following are the five-fold cause.
<i>1) Adhistathanam</i> the  physical  body  comprising  the  five  elements  of
material creation.
<i>2) Karta</i> the <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  being  endowed  with  the  properties  of
intelligence  and  action  giving  the  ability  to  think   and   act
accordingly.
<i>3) Karanam</i> are the various organs such as  eyes,  ears  etc.  along  with
those of locomotion such as feet, hands, etc. endowed  with  functions
of combining to produce actions.
<i>4) Pranas</i> is the vital airs which in the form of automatically  breathing
sustains life
<i>5) Paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul exists simultaneously within all  <i>jives</i>  as
the witness and monitor and includes the <i>atma</i> or  individual  immortal
soul.

<p>
That the <i>jivas</i> ability to perform activities is dependent upon  <i>paramatma</i>
but not influenced by Him  is  confirmed  in  Vedanta  Sutra  II.III.XXXX
beginning <i>krita prayatnapek  shastu  vihita  prati  siddha</i>  meaning:  The
Supreme Lord impels the <i>jivas</i> according to their  nature  and  tendencies
from previous activities and does  not  interfere  in   the  freewill  or
invalidate the injunctions or ordinances of the Vedic scriptures  in  any
way.
<p>
It might be speculated with an objection that if  the  <i>jiva</i>  performance  of
action is dependent upon and is a consequence of <i>paramatma</i> then there is  no
need to be concerned about <i>karma</i> or reactions from actions. But this  is  an
erroneous  conception  and  not  harmonious   with   the   injunctions   and
interdictions of the Vedic scriptures. <i>Paramatma</i> grants the <i>jiva</i> a  physical
body and its organs to function by the powers inherent in  them.  All  <i>jives</i>
are empowered by and dependent upon <i>paramatma</i> without exception.  The  <i>jivas</i>
thus equipped to function are factually dependent  upon  <i>paramatma</i>  although
they have  been  bequeathed  freewill  which  is  above  instinctual  animal
behaviour and if they  choose  to  utilise  it  they  have  the  ability  to
determine and choose their actions and execute the  appropriate  effort  for
such to manifest. Internally within the etheric heart <i>paramatma</i>  unbeknownst
to the <i>jiva</i>  is  monitoring  all  thoughts  and  actions,  sanctioning  them
silently by not interfering in the freewill of any <i>jiva.</i> The  <i>jiva</i>  in  this
sense is the secondary doer because of freewill and thus is subject  to  the
mandatory results of <i>karma</i> or reactions to actions. Just as a heavy  boulder
requires the combined efforts of many people to move it yet the  person  for
whom it is effected for derives the benefit or detriment of  its  removable.
In the same manner the effort to accomplish an action although comprised  of
different elements, bestows the positive or negative  results  to  the  <i>jiva</i>
who enacted the effort.
