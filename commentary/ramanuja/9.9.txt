The seemingly complex diversities of creation never  implicate  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna nor do they indicate a charge of mercilessness against Him  due
to His being <i>asaktam</i> or unattached. This is because the differences and  all
inequalities that exist in the demigods, humans, animals and plants lies  in
the fact that all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings which  are  of  a  conscious  and
sentient nature have to account to the reactions of their  past  good  deeds
and misdeeds and hence their own  actions  determine  such  differences  and
inequalities. Hence difference in dispensation and inequality in  allocation
is not to be prescribed from the  Supreme Lord  due  to  the  fact  that  he
understands such designations  as  the  merits  and  demerits  of  a  living
entities own <i>karma</i> or reactions to previous actions.  So  He  is  completely
indifferent and totally neutral in  all  respects.  If  one  were  still  to
object that this conduct is not exemplary due to  the  lack  of  distinction
between all <i>atma's</i> or souls at time  of  dissolution,  it  still  is  not  a
legitimate objection because all <i>atma's</i> are  immortal  and  exist  eternally
and each and every one is accounted for. Also non-distinction at the tim  of
dissolution is valid because names and forms were absent  at  the  time  and
all  <i>atma's</i> existed before creation and creation  is  without  beginning  as
confirmed in Brahma Sutras  II.I.XXXV  beginning  <i>na  karmavibhagad-iti-chet</i>
which clarifies this objection  as  not  being  valid  because  creation  is
without beginning.
