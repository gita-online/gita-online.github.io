The compound word chinna-dvaidha means those who are no longer influenced
by dualities such as pleasure and pain, praise and ridicule, acceptance and
rejection. The word yatatmanah means those who have conditioned their minds
to focus on the atma or soul. The words sarva-bhuta-hite-ratih means those
who always wish for all living beings the same happiness and righteousness
as they would wish for themselves. The word rsayah refers to the saintly
sages who are focused and intent on obtaining atma tattva or realisation of
the soul. Those of this category abandon all impurities that are opposed to
atma realisation and by doing so they shortly attain the bliss of the atma.
That the eternal atma is very accessible and can be easily reached Lord
Krishna will explain next.
