The word ihaiva means even here in this very life  while  engaged  in  karma
yoga or the performance of  prescribed  Vedic  activities  followed  by  the
words jitah sargo meaning conquers  creation  in  the  form  of  terminating
samsara or the endless cycle of birth and death in the  material  existence.
This is the result for one situated in  the  equanimity  of  perceiving  the
atma or soul as equal in all living entities, they become fixed in the  atma
itself. Then one becomes established in the Brahman or spiritual  substratum
pervading  all  existence  which  is  indeed  victory  over  samsara.   Lord
Krishna's purport is that those who have realised the  eternal  atma  within
themselves and within all living entities are indeed enligtened  beings  and
have  attained  moksa  or  liberation  from  material  existence.  How   one
performing karma yoga  becomes  eligible  to  achieve  this  apex  ascending
omniscience of atma perception is revealed next.
