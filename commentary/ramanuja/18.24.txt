The word <i>mohat</i> means  in  illusion,  deluded.  The  word  <i>ksaya</i>  means  loss

word <i>anubandham</i> meaning consequences is not considering the consequences  of
one's actions and <i>paurusam</i> meaning capacity denotes oblivious to whether  or
not one has the capability to complete it. The word <i>himsa</i>  meaning  violence

endeavours engaged in foolish delusion are locked in <i>tama guna</i> the  mode  of
ignorance.
