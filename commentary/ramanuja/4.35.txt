By learning this spiritual knowledge one will never be deluded again by
maya or illusion which causes one to have the misconception that the atma
or soul is the physical body and  the notion of the ego consciousness of I-
ness and my-ness that is produced thereby. Not by illusion but by the
realisation of one's atma within and the consciousness that all beings in
variegated forms all over creation possess this self same soul equally once
they are divested from their individual designations and all souls are of a
purly spiritual nature once they are disassociated from matter and all are
a part of the Supreme Being which is identical to Lord Krishna. The nature
of the atma is the essence and is equally the same in all beings as well as
being equal with the nature of the Supreme Being. Thus when disassociated
from matter one atma is non-different from another and possesses the
attributes of the Supreme.
