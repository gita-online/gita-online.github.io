All the worlds throughout the <i>Brahmanda</i> or the levels of  material  creation
from the topmost Brahmaloka down to lowest  Pataloka  are  appointed  realms
where beings may taste as much as they are able material  happiness  in  the
form of  wealth,  power,  dominion,  etc.  But  these  material  realms  are
impermanent  and  perishable.  Inasmuch  as  the  very  realms  where   such
activities  of  enjoyment  are  unstable  and  transitory  then  it  can  be
understood that the happiness and pleasures experienced there  are  fleeting
and temporary and some time come to an  end.  This  is  inevitable.  To  the
contrary those who perform <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion to Lord Krishna who  is
omniscient and omnipotent and whom  the  complete  cosmic  manifestation  of
creation and dissolution is emanating from Him as mere sport. He who is  the
most compassionate, the most merciful,  the  most  enduring  being  eternal;
once His  devotees  attain  Him  there  is  no  question  of  rebirth  being
reincarnated again in a womb in the material existence.  By  Lord  Krishna's
grace they directly attain the eternal spiritual worlds in His  association.
The next three verses will be a dissertation on the great cycles of  created
beings as willed by  the  Supreme  Lord  which  periodically  regulates  the
appearance and disappearance  of  all  regions  in  the  material  existence
beginning with the realm of Brahma the designer and architect of creation.
