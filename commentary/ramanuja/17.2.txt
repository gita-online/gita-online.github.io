The <i>gunas</i> or three modes of material nature are  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of
goodnes<i>, raja guna</i> the mode of passion and <i>tama guna</i> the mode of  ignorance.
They are singularly inherent within  the  faith  of  all  mankind  and  they
conform to the characteristics and disposition particular to  each  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being.  The  impressions  from  past  life  incarnations  arise  as
tendencies pursued in a present life correspondent to one's mood  and  taste
and from that mood and taste ones' faith arises. Displays of enthusiasm  are
indications of faith where underlying is the belief that the effort will  be
successfully fulfilled. Tendency, taste and faith  are  actually  properties
of the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul;  but  they  are  only  evoked  when  the  <i>atma</i>
happens by chance to come in contact with the <i>gunas.</i>  It  has  been  deduced
that when there is tranquillity in the mind there is control of  the  senses
and peacefulness of the body and such effect manifests  the  chance  contact
between the <i>atma</i> and the <i>gunas</i> resulting in <i>sattva guna.</i>  Agitation  of  the
mind, unbridled senses and over indulgence of the body results in  <i>raja</i>  and
<i>tama guna.</i> Thus  effectively the experiences from past lives  manifest  into
one of the three <i>gunas.</i>
