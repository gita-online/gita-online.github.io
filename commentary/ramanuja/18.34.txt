The  word  <i>svapnam</i>  means  slumber  inferring  slothfulness.  <i>Madam</i>  is  the
delusion of enjoying sense objects. The <i>dharmedah</i> or unintelligent fools  do
not oppose their mind from allowing their senses to buffet then  hither  and
thither  in  pursuit  of  sense  gratification.  They  even  sanction   such
treatment to satisfy their desires. The terms  <i>bhayam</i>  or  dread,  <i>sokam</i>  or
grief and <i>nisadam</i> or dejection are the by  products  of  this  delusion  and
those who occupy their time and energy  and  waste  their  invaluable  human
life as such Lord Krishna confirms are indispensably situated in <i>tama  guna</i>.
