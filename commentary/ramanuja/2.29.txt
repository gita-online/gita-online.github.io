Among  innumerable  living  entities  rarely  is  one  to   be   found   who
determinedly  absolved  themselves  of  all   sinful   reactions   and   has
accumulated sufficient merit as to  become  self-realised  enabling  one  to
perceive the separate nature and the distinct aspect  of  the  eternal  soul
within. Such a realised soul may  attempt  to  give  this  understanding  to
another similarly disposed or one may make an attempt to  understand  it  by
hearing about it and so forth as examples in this verse. But  only  one  who
has acquired enough merit to realise the eternal  soul  within  can  possess
the true understanding of the eternal soul and  no  other.  The  conjunctive
particle <i>ca</i> used at the end  of  the  verse  denotes  that  even  among  the
philosophers, speakers and seekers of knowledge about the eternal soul;  the
transference of bonafide information given and received  concerning  factual
knowledge of  what the eternal soul actually is, is very rare.
