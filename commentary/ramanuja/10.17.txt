The word Lord Krishna uses to describe His <i>atma-vibhutayah</i> or  His  personal
divine transcendental opulence is <i>pradhanyatah</i> which  means  prominent,  the
most exalted of His manifestations for it would not be possible  to  recount
them all as His glories are perpetual. Throughout this chapter  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna has  expressed  His  power  of  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness of the Supreme Lord. His <i>yoga</i> denotes  the  rulership  as  the
creator of all  and  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  denotes  the  governance  of  all  living
entities as displayed by His residing in the etheric heart of  every  living
entity.  This  also  includes  the  functions  of  creator,  preserver   and
destroyer of the total material manifestation.
