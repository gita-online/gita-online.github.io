Whoever speculates that it is possible by any means to  kill  the  soul  and
whoever speculates that  anyone can be instrumental in killing the  soul  is
factually deficient in actual  knowledge.  The  soul  being  of  an  eternal
nature can never be destroyed by anything nor  can  the  soul  ever  destroy
anything. The root  word  <i>hanti</i>  meaning  to  slay  connotes  an  act  which
connects with the soul; but the action of killing indicates that there is  a
separation of the soul  from  the  body.  Thus  the  Vedic  injunctions:  <i>na</i>
<i>himsyad bhutani</i>  meaning  no  creature  shall  be  harmed  and  <i>brahmano  na</i>
<i>hantavyah</i> that no brahmana shall  ever  be  killed  specifically  emphasises
that it is an  act  of  acute  and  heinous  unrighteousness  to  cause  the
separation of any soul from its embodied state unnaturally which happens  at
the time of death.
