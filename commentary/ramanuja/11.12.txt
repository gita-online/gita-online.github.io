In  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  divine,  transcendental  and   phenomenal
<i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form infinitely  high  and  unfathomably  wide
with splendorous effulgence and unlimited faces,  heads,  eyes  and  bodies,
with  unlimited  celestial  weapons  and   unlimited   celestial   ornaments
accompanied by  celestial  unguents,  divine  garlands  and  raiment's.  All
interacting with unlimited wonders and marvels.  Arjuna  could  clearly  see
manifested in a single location within the universal form  all  of  creation
with its unlimited multifarious and  variegated  details  from  the  greatly
powerful Brahma and all the demigods down to a humble  blade  of  grass.  He
could see the complete animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms  and  all  the
diverse  planetary  systems  all  composed  of  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the   material
substratum pervading material existence from the highest Bhur, Bhuvar,  Svar
etc. all the way down to the lowest planetary  system  of  Patala  with  all
there varying inhabitants, habitats and  habits. He could also perceive  the
<i>brahman</i> or  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  with  its
sublimely subtle transcendental presence imperceptible to normal  eyes.  All
this was seen by Arjuna due to the divine  vision  bequeathed  upon  him  by
Lord Krishna substantiating His declarations in chapter  10  such  as  verse
39: That He  is  the  origin  of  all  and  nothing  can  exist  separately,
independent from Him and in verse 42 He states that by a  mere  fraction  of
His potency He maintains and sustains all moving and stationary beings.
