The aspirant who renounces both the desire for rewards as well as  any  ego-
sense as the  doer is fully in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode  of  goodness.  Situated
in correct knowledge and hence free from all doubts such a  one  is  neither
besieged by unrighteous acts nor relieved  from  righteous  acts.  Righteous
acts are those that bestow positive reactions such as progeny,  cows,  entry
into the heavenly planets, etc. An unrighteous act is  that  which  one  may
accidentally or unintentionally commit that will accrue  negative  reactions
such as misery, pain, entry to the hellish planets, etc. It  should  not  be
misconstrued that final emancipation  applies  to  anyone  who  deliberately
engages  in  unrighteous  activities  for  the  Katha   Upanisad   I,II.XXIV
beginning <i>na virato duscharitanna shanto</i> states: One who  has  not  desisted
from evil unrighteous actions or who  is  of  unrestrained  mind  can  never
achieve final emancipation even  if  one  is  a  paragon  of  intellect  and
knowledge.
<p>
In as much as the ego-sense  is  absent  there  is  no  impetus  to  exhibit
aversion or attraction for either one or  the  other  and  since  all  other
goals have been relinquished and resigned with the  exception  of  <i>moksa</i>  or
final emancipation from material existence and communion  with  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  as  revealed  in  Vedic
scriptures then one is truly established in ultimate renunciation. Thus  the
conclusion is that relinquishing all ego-sense of authorship and  abandoning
any desire for rewards is actual renunciation and not mere  abstention  from
actions.
