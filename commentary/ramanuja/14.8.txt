Lord Krishna describes the  word  <i>ajnana</i>  meaning  ignorance  which  is  the
antithesis of wisdom. The word  <i>jnana</i>  meaning  knowledge  is  the  precise,
accurate perception whereas <i>ajnana</i> is the perverted, inaccurate  perception.
The word <i>tamas</i> means darkness denoting the  darkness  of  ignorance  and  is
diametrically opposite to the light of knowledge. The word <i>mohanam</i>  is  that
which deludes into illusion and the darkness of  ignorance.  This  <i>tamas</i>  is
also the  cause  of  <i>pramada</i>  or  madness  and  listlessness  which  is  the
inability to focus having a fragmented attention span. It is also the  cause
of  <i>alasya</i> or  indolence  slothlike  laziness  which  is  the  inability  to
properly execute any  endeavor  properly  and  <i>nidrabhih</i>  or  sleep  is  the
disinclination of the senses to function  terminating  all  activities.  All
these things <i>nibadhanti</i> or binds  one  to  the  material  existence  without
reprieve.The  sublation  of  the  external  senses  constitutes  the   dream
state;but when the mind is  also  sublated  then  the  dream  state  becomes
sleep.
