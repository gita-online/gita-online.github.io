What Lord Krishna is stating about those situated  in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  or  the
mode of goodness increase their wisdom  to  fruition  then  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the immortal soul becomes a reality. When <i>raja  guna</i>  or  the
mode of passion increases in intensity more  and  more  avid  appetites  are
incited to enjoy the fruits of. Similarly when <i>tama  guna</i>  or  the  mode  of
ignorance  increases  it  manifests  as  perverted  understanding  and   the
proclivity to be influenced by wickedness from which more and more  <i>tama</i>  is
begotten. Thus all developement of intelligence is blocked and neutralised.
