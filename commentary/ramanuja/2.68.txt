Lord Krishna is  explaining  that  realisation  of  the  soul  is  like  the
darkness of night to all conditioned living entities. Being that the  wisdom
of soul cognition does not shine forth unto them who pursue sensual  objects
being likened to the darkness of night. But that understanding of  the  soul
for the realised being who have subjugated their senses is lucidly awake  in
this night and sublimely  aware  remaining  focused  on  the  bliss  of  the
eternal soul. Whereas  those  of  mundane  understanding  who  occupy  their
existence awake to the pursuits of sensuous delights  in  this  darkness  of
night are asleep to the reality of soul cognition. Sensual pursuits are  not
appealing to one situated in soul cognition.
