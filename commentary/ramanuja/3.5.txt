No living being in the material existence can remain  inactive  even  for  a
moment without initiating or pursuing  some  activity  or  another.  If  one
should steadfastly determine to perform absolutely nothing, still one  would
be compelled into action by the qualities of   the  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  being
<i>sattva</i> or goodness, <i>rajas</i> or  passion  and  <i>tamas</i>  or  ignorance,  all  from
<i>prakriti,</i> material nature. The effects of these have sprung  into  existence
from one's past life activities. Thus by adhering to <i>karma yoga</i> the yoga  of
actions without desires one's accumulated sins will gradually  dissolve  and
then mastery over the <i>gunas</i> and <i>prakriti</i>  is  achieved.  At  this  time  the
mind has become pure and one becomes qualified for <i>jnana yoga.</i> Otherwise  as
Lord Krishna states anyone attempting  to pursue <i>jnana yoga</i> in lieu of  this
is a charlatan and all their attempts is merely a charade.
