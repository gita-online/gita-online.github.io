Lord Krishna is addressed as <i>Vishnu</i> or He which is all pervading. The  words
<i>nabhah</i> means the firmament above and is in  reference  to  the  <i>parama-vyoma</i>
which is the supreme region beyond even the heavenly planets  and  celestial
spheres which are still subject  to  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence consisting of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of
material nature being passion, goodness and ignorance. Several examples  are
given in the Vedic scriptures such as  <i>tad  akshate  parame  vyoman</i>  meaning
high above in the imperishable  firmament,  <i>aditya-varnam  tamasah  parastat</i>
meaning the golden firmament beyond all  ignorance,  <i>kshyantam  asya  rajasa</i>
<i>parake</i> meaning the refuge beyond  the  mode  of  passion,  <i>yo  asy-alhyaksha</i>
<i>parame vyoman</i> meaning He which controls all in the sublime  firmament.    To
use the two words <i>nabhah-sprsam</i> means pervading the  firmament  and  denotes
that Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form is infinite  and  the
shelter  of  all  the  modifications  found  in  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material
substratum pervading all physical existence.  The  words  <i>pravyathita-antah-</i>
<i>atma</i> means extremely agitated mind and substantiates why  Arjuna  is  unable
to be <i>dhritim</i>  composed  and  feel  <i>saman</i>  or  peaceful.  This  was  due  to
witnessing the terrifying awful apparition aspect  of  the  <i>visvarupa</i>  which
made his mind recoil, his limbs  quiver  uncontrolled  and  all  his  senses
aghast.
