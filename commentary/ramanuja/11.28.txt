Lord Krishna is addressed as Vishnu or He who pervades the entire  creation.
The mighty warriors who will fight in the battle  are  already  captured  in
the <i>visvarupa's</i> innumerable flaming mouths voraciously devouring  them.  All
are seared and scathed by the heat of its  blazing  effulgence  encompassing
all the worlds.
