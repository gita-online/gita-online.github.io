The science of <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion with its requirements was  revealed
by Lord Krishna in chapter nine. In  order  to  nourish  and  engender  such
loving devotion and increase it, Lord Krishna undertakes with compassion  to
discourse further and expatiate on the subject of the infinity  of  infinite
glories of the Supreme Lord, such  as  unrivalled  sovereignty,  indomitable
will, inviolable power, unparalleled compassion, <i>paramatma</i>  or  the  Supreme
soul  within  all  sentient  beings  and   all   creation   comprising   His
transcendental form.

Lord Krishna speaks  the  words  <i>te  priyamanaya</i>  which  can  mean  one  who
possesses divine love or one who is  a  beloved  confidant.  Because  Arjuna
became delighted by listening to the glories of the Supreme Lord to  further
increase his joy and to fan his ardour for  loving   devotion  Lord  Krishna
once again reveals revelatory information regarding the sublime glories  and
incomparable attributes of the Supreme Lord. This He does desiring  Arjuna's
highest good and ultimate benefit.
