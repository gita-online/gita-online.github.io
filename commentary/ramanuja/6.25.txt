One advanced  in  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness by <i>dhyana</i> or  meditation
is the person who gravitates in proximity  to  Lord  Krishna's  eternal  and
divine, transcendental nature in the  manner  as  prescribed  in  the  Vedic
scriptures. Impeccable without a blemish  such  a  one  attains  to  supreme
equanimity. Whosoever realises that the nature of the eternal <i>atma</i>  or  soul
is identical in essence and purity, transcendental to all dualities  and  is
comparable to the Supreme Lord Krishna and who so perceiving  realises  that
Lord Krishna is the essence of the <i>atma</i> as well and that all <i>atma's</i>  are  in
Him and seeing one's own <i>atma</i> in oneself as well as the <i>atma's</i> in all  other
beings have realised the ultimate  truth  and  Lord  Krishna  is  no  longer
veiled from them because one's nature has become the  same  as  His  and  He
accepts them as His own Self and always reveals Himself  to  them  in  their
hearts.
