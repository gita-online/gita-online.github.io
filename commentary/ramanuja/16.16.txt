Lord Krishna confirms that the  demoniac  nature  is  in  itself  a  hellish
condition of life perpetuating more and more  degraded  hellish  existences.
The three portals to hellish existence  are  lust,  greed  and  anger  which
completely destroy and ruin all opportunities  for  advancing  in  spiritual
consciousness. Lust, greed and anger are the foundations for all  the  other
vices and sinfulness  described  previously  which  run  rampant  among  the
demoniac. The word <i>dvaram</i> means portal and gate  inferring  the  cause.  The
words <i>nasanam atmanah</i>  means  destructive  or  even  suicidal  denoting  how
utterly negative lust, greed and anger are in evolving the consciousness  to
commune with the immortal  soul.  Therefore  Lord  Krishna  emphasizes  that
lust, greed and anger must be permanently abandoned, fully relinquished  and
completely neutralised since these three voracious vices comprise the  cause
that leads a <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  directly  to  dreaded  <i>naraka</i>  or  the
hellish planets.
