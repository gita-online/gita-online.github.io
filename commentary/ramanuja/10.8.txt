The words <i>mac-citta</i> means those who devote their  hearts  on  Lord  Krishna.
The words <i>mad-gata-prana</i> means those whose lives cannot exist  without  Lord
Krishna. Such  great  beings  constantly  enlighten  each  other  about  His
transcendental attributes and extraordinary <i>lila's</i> or  divine  pastimes  and
exchange bliss by relating  the  realisations  they  have  experienced  from
such. The sense of  satisfaction  from  the  mere  conversation  about  Lord
Krishna makes them so blissful  that  there  contentment  is  permanent  and
needs nothing else to complete it. Furthermore  simply  hearing  about  Lord
Krishna's <i>lila's</i> causes these devotees  to  become  ecstatic,  exhibiting  a
rapturous and exultant glow of love.
