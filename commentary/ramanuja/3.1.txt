The ultimate purpose of the Bhagavad-Gita is to show in a  clear  and  lucid
manner that one-pointed   loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Being  who  is
glorified and proclaimed in the Vedas is the singular and paramount goal  to
be attained by all human beings specifically and for all  living  beings  in
general.  Who is proclaimed  in  the  Upanisads  as  the  singular  goal  to
achieve by the aspirants for <i>moksa</i> or liberation  from  material  existence.
Who  is  declared  in  the  Puranas  as  being  destitute  of  all  defiling
characteristics such as <i>avidya</i> or  nescience.  This  Supreme  Being  who  is
possessing boundless and  unlimited  magnificent  and  glorious  attributes.
<i>Bhakti yoga</i> or loving devotional service is exclusively only in relation  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorised  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations
as revealed in Vedic scriptures. In order to achieve full success in  <i>bhakti</i>
<i>yoga</i> it is essential to achieve <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of one's  eternal
soul. The  <i>atma</i>  or  soul  is  one's  eternal  nature  beyond  all  material
conceptions and is a necessary preliminary step. <i>Atma tattva</i>  is  ultimately
attained by <i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of spiritual  knowledge  from  the
Vedic scriptures which is generated by <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  the  performance  of
prescribed Vedic  activities  without  attachment.  These  prescribed  Vedic
activities are established on the foundation that the <i>atma</i>  is  eternal  and
can never be modified or destroyed as delineated so clearly by Lord  Krishna
in chapter two.
<p>
Brahma has stated  that  the  acquisition  of  <i>paravidya</i>  or  the  knowledge
required to attain the Supreme Being is known as <i>bhakti</i> or  loving  devotion
and that <i>dahara-vidya</i> or that this  method  of  meditation  is  required  to
realise the Supreme Being, who resides within  the  etheric  region  of  the
heart. In the Chandogya Upanisad it is given that  the  realisation  of  the
<i>atma</i> within one's own heart is the first ancillary step by the God  aspirant
to attaining realisation of the Supreme Being Himself. Then the  incorporeal
and non-material reality of the <i>atma</i>  and  its  eternal  nature  beyond  the
consciousness of waking, sleeping and dreaming  is  completely  transcended.
Thus does the phenomenal  nature  of  the  <i>atma</i>  emerging  from  within  the
physical body, radiant  in  ineffable  light  shining  in  its  natural  and
wonderous effulgence. In the  Katha  Upanisad  this  subject  is  also  well
elucidated as given in the following description:  By  perceiving  <i>paramatma</i>
which is the Supreme Soul existing  simultaneously  within  all  beings  and
then by discrimination obtained after realisation of  the  individual  <i>atma.</i>
The enlightened one delivers themselves from attraction and  repulsion,  joy
and grief and all other  dualities.  Communion  with  the  Supreme  Soul  is
communion with the Supreme Being which is the goal to  be  attained  through
the discrimination derived directly from <i>atma  tattva.</i>  This  confirms  that
<i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of  the  soul  is  an  essential  ingerdient  and
constituent component of the Supreme Being which is attained  by  <i>bhakti</i>  or
loving devotion. Another  example  is:  Knowing  the  magnificent  and  all-
pervading nature of <i>paramatma</i> the  Supreme  Soul,  the  enlightened  one  no
longer grieves or laments which reveals the natural potency of the  <i>atma</i>  to
relieve one of all mundane dross  due  to  the  influence  of  the  material
existence<i>.</i>
<p>
The eternal soul known as the <i>atma</i> is not gainable merely by  hearing  about
it. Nor is it obtainable by discoursing about it nor  is  it  attainable  by
meditating exclusively on it. The <i>atma</i> is attainable solely  to  those  whom
the <i>atma</i> alone elects to attain it. Whomsoever the <i>atma</i> selects  as  an  act
of sovereign grace alone the <i>atma</i> reveals itself to such a one. Who is  such
a one? It is none other than that person who has  discriminatory  wisdom  as
their charioteer, who has the reins of their mind controlling the steeds  of
the senses, who has the actual competence to  achieve  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
and attain the coveted goal of loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.
<p>
So in conclusion what  we  have  just  presented  in  essence  form  is  the
ultimate purpose  of  the  Bhagavad-Gita.  From  chapter  three  along  with
chapters four, five and six the path for the  aspirant  is  given  beginning
with the very first question in this chapter. The  means  of  cognition  and
the method of realisation along with the meditation required to  achieve  it
will be delineated and forthcoming.
