Now Lord Krishna explains the austerities that are of <i>tama guna</i> or  mode  of
ignorance. The word <i>mudha</i> means foolish. The word <i>grahena</i>  means  endeavour.
Those who foolishly endeavour are the ignorant. Those who torture  and  give
pain to themselves and diabolically cause injury  and  suffering  to  others
are depraved and their dark resolves  are  at  the  pinnacle  of  nescience.
Whatever activity they enact  by  such  convoluted  resolves  regardless  of
success or failure is in the darkness of <i>tama guna.</i>
