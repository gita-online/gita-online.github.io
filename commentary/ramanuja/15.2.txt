The branches on this <i>asvattha</i>  tree symbolise  all  the  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings who arise  due  to  <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  to  actions.  The  downward
branches symbolise humans, animals, plants, etc.  and  the  upward  branches
symbolise the 300 million demigods administering universal management.   All
the branches are part of <i>prakriti</i> thematerial substratum pervading  physical
existence and all are nourished  by  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or  three  modes  of
material nature which are <i>sattva</i> or goodness, <i>rajas</i> or passion and <i>tamas</i>  or
ignorance. The sprouts on the branches symbolises  desires  for  objects  of
the senses. This <i>asvattha</i> tree has its  roots  in  Brahma-loka  the  highest
material planet and its branches end in the worlds of humans but  there  the
humans are constantly creating new rootlets which are  the  <i>karmas</i>  acquired
from performing actions which are  enjoined  and  prohibited  in  the  Vedic
scriptures.The activities performed as <i>jivas</i>  while  in  bodies  of   humans
exclusively results in higher level or lower level births. By  ignoring  the
injunctions and prohibitions of the Vedic scriptures the results  are  lower
level births such as animals, reptiles, insects, plants.  The  adherance  to
the injunctions and prohibitions of the Vedic scriptures results  in  higher
level births such as the demigods and also human births which still  affords
a <i>jiva</i> the golden opportunity to  spiritually  evolve  and  grow;  sometimes
even achieving <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material  existence  in  their  very
next lifetime.
