Lord Krishna explains that within His <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine  universal  form
the 12 Adityas, the 8 Vasus, the 11 Rudras, the  2  Asvins,  the  49  Maruts
etc.  can  all  be  seen.  It  can   be   perceived   in   His   magnificent
extraordinarily phenomenal universal form, unlimited  wonders  and  marvels.
They are marvels that can be  manifest  in  this  world,  marvels  that  can
manifest in other worlds and all those marvels mentioned  and  described  in
the Vedic scriptures which may include some  or  all  of  the  previous  two
categories. All of these wonders have never before been seen.
