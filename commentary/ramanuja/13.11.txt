By the Supreme Lord Krishna who is known as <i>Parabrahma</i> intrinsic potency  as
the source of the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence
it is devoid of all  divisions  abiding  everywhere  within  all  creatures,
demigods, humans etc. But to the spiritually unaware  there  appears  to  be
divisions and differences due to variegation of  forms.  What  Lord  Krishna
has stated in verse two of this chapter that those who are knowledgeable  of
the <i>ksetra-jna</i> are spiritually enlightened about the <i>atma</i> or  immortal  soul
existing equally within all living entities  distinctly  separate  from  the
physical body although resideing within the etheric heart  of  all  sentient
beings. When textural quotes are read as I am a demigod, I am  a  man,  etc.
it is only referring to the body, the physical form shrouding the  <i>atma</i>  due
to <i>karma</i> the resultant reactions from past life  activities.  To  comprehend
the <i>atma</i> as a  distinct,  separate  immortal  entity  can  be  discerned  by
reflection and contemplation inasmuch as the <i>atma</i> provides the  support  for
the aggregate combination of the five fundamental elements of earth,  water,
fire, air and ether which in varying degrees make up the physical  body.  So
<i>Parabrahma</i> is  known  as  <i>bhuta-bhartr</i>  the  maintainer  of  all  beings  as
distinguished from the maintained. Since <i>Parabrahma</i> exists  after  the  time
of universal destruction He is known as  <i>grasisnu</i>  the  annihilator  of  the
material  elements  as  distinguished   from   the   annihilated.    Because
<i>Parabrahma</i> is the causer of transformations He is known as <i>prabha-visnu</i>  the
creator of  universal  manifestation  as  distinguished  from  the  created.
Inasmuch as no such properties are ever present in a dead  body  it  can  be
correctly concluded that mere matter possessed <i>ksetra</i> or field  of  activity
is never capable of being the maintainer, the  annihilator  or  the  creator
whereas the <i>ksetra-jna</i> is capable.
