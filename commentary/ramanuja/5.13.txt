The word <i>prabhu</i> means master or ruler and the <i>atma</i> or soul  representing  an
eternal portion of the Supreme Lord is the ruler of each  physical body.  By
its eternal nature it is beyond the influence of actions and  reactions  and
resides  impervious  to  them  in  its  own  nature.  This  <i>atma</i>  being  the
individual soul is not the originator in the material creation of  the  four
categories of living entities: the demi-gods, human  beings,  the  fauna  or
animal kingdoms and the flora  or  plant  kingdom.  The  <i>atma</i>  is  also  not
subject  to  any  activities  of  authorship  emanating  from   these   four
categories, nor any connection to the resultant reactions  of  any  activity
such as descending into the animal species  or  ascending  to  the  heavenly
spheres and becoming a demi-god. What  is  it  then  that  accomplishes  all
these activities? It is the very nature inherent within all beings which  is
the cause of all designations.  By  nature  it  is  meant  the  <i>samkaras</i>  or
impressions from past lifetimes  formatted by the reactions from  the  chain
of activities generated since time immemorial. By nature it  is  also  meant
the  illusion  of  authorship  and  the  terminal  habit  of  regarding  the
temporary physical body as a constitute of the eternal <i>atma.</i>   Thus  it  can
be clearly discerned that the essential nature of  the  <i>atma</i>  being  eternal
has no interconnection to the authorship  of  actions  or  the  doership  of
actions which are temporary and the products of  association  with  material
matter.
