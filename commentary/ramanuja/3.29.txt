The misinformed make attempts for <i>atma-tattva</i> or soul  realisation  but  due
to their ignorance of the true nature of the <i>atma</i> or  soul  and  because  of
their acute identification with the physical body and the  senses  they  are
obstructed in their attempts by the influences of the three <i>gunas</i> being  the
mode of goodness, passion and nescience.  Such a person is  quickly  brought
under the control of the <i>gunas</i> by their association with sense  objects  and
cannot divert these natural tendencies towards <i>atma-tattva.</i>  Thus  they  are
not qualified for <i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation of knowledge  but  are  only
competent for <i>karma yoga</i> or performing prescribed Vedic activities.

The person situated in Vedic wisdom  in  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  after  observing   the
meager capacities of the ignorant masses with their  sluggish  understanding
should not attempt to convert them to <i>jnana yoga</i> from their easy to  perform
path of <i>karma yoga.</i> This is because it would be dangerous for  the  ignorant
to give up the path of <i>karma yoga</i> to follow the  path  of  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  when
they are in no way qualified to do so. Leaving the path of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  and
unable to follow the path of <i>jnana yoga</i> they would having nothing and be  at
a loss in their lives. The conclusion is that one situated in  Vedic  wisdom
and is a prominent leading figure in society should also perform  prescribed
Vedic activities in <i>karma yoga</i> even though such a  person  is  a  knower  of
<i>atma-tattva.</i> By acting in this way and performing Vedic  activities  without
attachment lesser men will follow his example and perform in a like  manner.

It has been shown earlier in this chapter that  even  for  <i>jnana  yogis</i>  the
path of <i>karma yoga</i> is preferable, hence persons  of  Vedic  wisdom  who  are
leaders in society should also tread the path of <i>karma yoga</i>  as  beacons  of
light for the masses in the world. The method of performing  <i>karma  yoga</i>  by
understanding that the <i>atma</i> is distinct from  the  physical  body  and  thus
ascribing the activities of the senses to be  from  the  influences  of  the
<i>gunas</i> has been thoroughly described.
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
One should contemplate and reflect on the  <i>atma</i>  and  its  essential  nature
which is purely spiritual. The <i>atma</i> performs no material  activity  but  has
association with actions through the  <i>gunas</i>  due  to  the  conjunction  with
<i>prakriti.</i> Thus in association with <i>prakriti</i> there  is  doer  ship  with  the
<i>atma</i> and without association there is none. The next verse will explain  the
relationship between the senses and the <i>gunas</i>  in  regards  to  the  Supreme
Lord who is omniscient and omnipresent. <i>Paramatma</i> who is  the  Supreme  Soul
of all living entities evidenced by the  fact  that  every  individual  soul
constitutes His eternal, transcendental, spiritual body and are His  eternal
parts and parcels.
