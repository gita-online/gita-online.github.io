Lord Krishna speaks the words <i>prabhur eva ca</i> meaning that He  alone  is  the
sole bestower of rewards in every respect. Amazingly fascinating it is  that
humans who engage in  the  very  selfsame  activities  of  propitiation  and
worship are differentiated and classified by the simple  difference  of  the
intention  and  motive  by  which  it  was  performed.  Some  performers  of
activities merit paltry, minimal  results  such  as  reaching  the  heavenly
planets and when there allotment of time there  has  expired  they  have  to
start all over again. While other performers of the  same  activities  merit
unlimited  and  transcendental  eternal  results  such  as  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul and never lose it  ever  as  they  attain  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation from material existence.
