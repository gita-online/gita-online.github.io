It should be understood and clearly comprehended that all  prescribed  Vedic
activities  both  <i>nitya</i>  or  eternal  and  <i>naimittika</i>  or   occasional   are
obligatory duties for aspirants seeking <i>moksa</i> or  liberation  from  material
existence and communion with the Supreme Lord. These  prescribed  activities
devolve into the specific duties <i>varna</i> and <i>asrama</i> or  the  stage  and  class
one is situated in. This may be initiated by birth  but  it  is  established
inherently and qualified by deeds. Actual renunciation  is  performing  such
prescribed Vedic activities free from  egoism,  without  any  attachment  or
desire for any rewards. This is real renunciation and is situated in  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> the  mode  of  goodness  where  the  source  of  spiritual  realisation
commences; properly situated in correct  knowledge,  untainted  by  delusion
and free from illusion. This theme will appear again in verse 30.
