Since the word <i>jnanam</i> or knowledge is  linked  to  <i>guhyataram</i>  meaning  most
confidential  it  denotes  wisdom  the  conclusion  of  knowledge  which  is
indispensable to an aspirant and the most  valuable  for  it  is  the  final
conclusion for the entire Srimad Bhagavad-Gita. Lord  Krishna  instructs  to
examine, analyse and contemplate the teachings of the three paths  known  as
<i>karma yoga</i> or facilitating communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  by  actions.
<i>Bhakti yoga</i> or facilitating communion with the  Supreme  Lord  by  exclusive
loving devotion and  by  <i>jnana  yoga</i>  or  facilitating  communion  with  the
Supreme Lord by empirical knowledge.  After  thoroughly  reflecting  on  how
each may be implemented into the reality of daily life one should  harmonise
them and act accordingly.
