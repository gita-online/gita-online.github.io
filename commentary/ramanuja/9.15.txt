The <i>mahatmanas</i> or those of great souls discuss,  sing  and  reflect  on  the
glories of Lord Krishna without abatement in what is  called  <i>jnana  yagnena</i>
or propitiation by  knowledge.  How  is  this  to  understand?  By  constant
meditation of Him  as  the  unity  comprising  the  infinite  variations  of
unlimited diversity displayed in creation as the form  of  the  cosmos.  The
essence of understanding this phenomena is  as  follows.  The  Supreme  Lord
Krishna alone is the sum total of all having within His spiritual  body  the
most fine and supra subtle state <i>chit</i> or  the  principles  of  consciousness
and  also  that  of  <i>achit</i>  or  inconsciousness  without  names,  forms  and
distinctness. By His indomitable will the Supreme Lord resolves to  manifest
from  His  spiritual  body  consciousness  and  inconsciousness  into  their
relative material states having names,  forms  and  distinctness.  Thus  the
Supreme Lord  Himself  being  the  totality  of  all  is  perceived  in  His
manifested cosmic form exhibiting the marvelous  variegations  of  existence
such as the heavenly demigods, humans, flora, fauna and aquatic as  well  as
the stationary kingdoms. Contemplating the Supreme  Lord  as  all  inclusive
they are worshipping Him. Therefore He  is  declared  to  be  the  universal
form.
