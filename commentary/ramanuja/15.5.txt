The light of illumination which manifests from the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul  is
what Lord Krishna is  referring  to  here  as  well.  As  His  transcendntal
spiritual body consists of the <i>atmas</i> of all <i>jivas</i> or  embodied  beings,  He,
His name, His abode and His pastimes are all illuminating. No  sun  or  moon
or fire can illuminate this; for it  is  spiritual  wisdom  that  gives  the
light of consciousness. External luminiousity is only able to  dissolve  the
obscurity that intervenes between the senses perceiving  their  objects.What
reveals the <i>atma</i> is called <i>yoga</i> or  the  individual  conciousness  attaining
communion with the ultimate consciousness. Antagonistic  to  <i>yoga</i>  is  <i>karma</i>
which are subsequent  reactions to previous  actions  and  to  conquer  this
formidable opponent which gains strength from every  action  performed;  one
must fully surrender unto the Supreme Lord and  accept  Him  as  one's  only
refuge. That all illuminating light emanates from Him, it is a part  of  His
splendour  as  a  power  from  Him.  The  sublime  supremacy  of  this   all
illuminating light consists of its potency and efficiency  in  lighting  the
consciousness by spiritual wisdom. Sunlight no matter how  bright,  although
capable of travelling for millions and billions of miles  through  space  is
never able to internally effect illumination in the consciousness as  it  is
only an external phenomena.
