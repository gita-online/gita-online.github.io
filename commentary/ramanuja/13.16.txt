The <i>atma</i> or immortal soul is compelled  to  accept  unlimited  varieties  of
physical bodies from  all  levels  of  creation.  Sometimes  as  a  demigod,
sometimes as a human, sometimes as an animal etc. These forms are  neutrally
awarded according to the <i>gunas</i> or  three  modes  of  goodness,  passion  and
ignorance which adhere in strict accordance to the <i>karma</i> or  reactions  from
past actions in proportion to the degree of attachment and cravings  one  is
predisposed  to  pursue  in  order  to  procure  pleasure  and  enjoy  sense
gratification. Taking birth one launches into activities pursuing  good  and
evil in order to satisfy and gratify ones desires  and  propensities.  Hence
is order to exhaust the <i>karma</i> one is  incessantly  creating  by  innumerable
actions one is born into wombs of good  and  evil  perpetually  in  material
existence. That is why it is stated that attachment  to  the  <i>gunas</i>  is  the
cause of birth in good and evil wombs. Born one performs  actions  and  from
the  reactions  one  is  forced  to  take  birth  again  and  again  without
cessation. This circumvolution  never  ends  until  by  the  aggregation  of
<i>sukriti</i> or pious activities one  seemingly  by  chance  has  the  auspicious
opportunity to attain the association of a Vaisnava devotee of  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna and being blessed by them alters the course  of  their  destiny
and upgrades their <i>karma</i> as Lord Krishna Himself confirms in  chapter  seven
verse 19 beginning  <i>bahunam  janmanam  ante</i>  meaning  after  many  births  a
knowledgeable living entity gets association of a <i>mahatma</i> or great soul.
