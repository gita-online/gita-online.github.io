Such is the greatness and  virtue  of  this  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the
individual consciousness attaining merit with  the  ultimate  consciousness,
that one's merit increases and accumulates as a  person  incarnates  through
many births and  ultimately  purifies  one  by  disengaging  them  from  all
attachments and impurities. In this way one becomes more and more  competent
and qualified for perfecting <i>yoga</i> and by  enthusiastic  effort  despite  any
chance interruptions one eventually achieves perfection  and  attains  <i>moksa</i>
or liberation from material existence. The superiority above all  others  of
the <i>yogi</i> who has chosen the  highest  of  human  ambitions  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul is revealed by Lord Krishna in the next verse.
