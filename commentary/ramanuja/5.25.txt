To those aspirants free from kama or lust and krodha or anger who are
yatinam or renounced sannyasis who are celibate brahmins devoting
themselves exclusively to the service of the Supreme Lord Krishna and His
authorised incarnations. Such being perceiving the Brahman or spiritual
substratum pervading all existence realise moksa or liberation from
material existence everywhere in every action. Now the subject of karma
yoga or the performance of prescribed Vedic activities which has as its aim
atma tattva or soul realisation is now concluded.
