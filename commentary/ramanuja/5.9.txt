The word <i>brahmany</i> used here is referring to the  Supreme  Lord  who  is  the
antithesis to material matter. One who performs  all  activities  reflecting
that they relate to the  functions  of  the  body  and  senses  and  pertain
exclusively to material matter and who knows that in reality the  individual
consciousness  has  nothing  to  do   with   it   remains   unaffected   and
uncontaminated from sinful reactions  arising  from  misconceptions  of  the
physical body being the <i>atma</i> or soul and the subsequent erroneous  mentality
that causes bondage to <i>samsara</i> or the endless cycle of birth  and  death  in
the material existence.
