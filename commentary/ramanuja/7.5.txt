Lord Krishna explains that the eight categories mentioned are of  His  lower
inferior energy being material. But He has a higher  superior  energy  which
is completely transcendent to the  insentient  nature  being  spiritual  and
contributing to the enjoyment of His  higher  nature  of  embodied  sentient
beings. This higher nature is eternal in nature in the form of the  <i>atma</i>  or
soul within all sentient beings and is distinctly different from  His  lower
insentient nature which pervades existence as well. The relationship of  the
higher nature to the  lower  nature  is  equated  to  the  enjoyer  and  the
enjoyed. The higher nature is further distinguished by  an  intellect  which
is totally absent in the lower insentient nature; but both  nature  manifest
from the Supreme Lord. The lower nature consisting of matter and the  higher
nature consisting of the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul within  all  sentient  beings.
By this higher superior energy  all  inert  and  non-intelligent  matter  is
upheld throughout all creation.
