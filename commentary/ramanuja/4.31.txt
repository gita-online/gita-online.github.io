That  person  who  does  not  perform  <i>yagna</i>  or  offerings  of  worship  to
propitiate the Supreme Lord  and  who  does  not  perform  the  regular  and
occasional duties  as  prescribed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  according  to
<i>varnasrama</i> or their rank  and  station  in  life.  Such  a  person   derives
absolutely no benefit for receiving a human existence in  this  world.  They
have wasted a very precious opportunity as a human birth is  very  difficult
to receive and humans are the only species on the Earth  with  freewill  and
the power to reflect on the Supreme. All the goals  which  humanity  aspires
for will also allude them for without following the ordinances of the  Vedic
scriptures which bequeath promotion in the material worlds how can  one  who
never performs <i>yagna</i> even on the level of the food they eat ever  expect  to
be promoted to the  heavenly  spheres  or  ever  become  qualified  for  the
ultimate achievement of  <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the  cycle  of  birth  and
death in the material existence.  <i>Moksa</i>  is  the  true  goal  of  all  human
endeavour and real purpose of human existence. The divine discourse  of  the
Bhagavad-Gita is all about <i>moksa</i>  which  is  the  eternal  summum  bonum  or
greatest good eternally for all humanity.
