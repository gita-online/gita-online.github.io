Lord Krishna manifesting as the <i>atma</i> is the master of <i>prakriti</i> the  material
substratum pervading physical existence from which generates  the  <i>gunas</i>  or
three modes of material nature from whence arise the senses .  The  <i>atma</i>  or
immortal  soul  rules  the  senses  as  they  are   designed   to   function
experiencing through  them  the  enjoyable  delights  of  their  appropriate
objects such as sights and sounds.
