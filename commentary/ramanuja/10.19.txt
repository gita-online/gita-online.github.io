The 12 Adityas are revealed in  the  Vishnu  Purana  being  Dhatri,  Aryama,
Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Vivasvan, Pushan, Parjanya, Amsu, Bhaga,  Tvastri  and
Vishnu.  The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine   transcendental
opulence is the one bearing the name Vishnu who is chief  of  them  all.  Of
the lights that shine in the countless universes Lord Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  is
the solar group consisting of  all  suns.  Of  the  7  Maruts  being  Avaha,
Prahava, Nivaha, Purvaha, Udvaha, Samvaha and  Parivaha  who  are  different
varieties of winds blowing throughout space, Lord Krishna's <i>vibhuti</i>  is  the
chief wind known as Parivaha who bears  the  name  <i>Marici</i>  the  primal  wind
which precedes all the others. Of all constellations Lord Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>
is the moon. The genitive  case  of  the  word  <i>sasi</i>  meaning  moon  is  not
referring to  one  out  of  many  but  is  specifying  one  over  all.  Thus
<i>naksatranam aham sasi</i> refers to the moon as being  the  Lord  over  all  the
constellations. This will also be exemplified similarly in  the  next  verse
where He states His <i>vibhuti</i> is the consciousness in all beings  which  means
that what exists as consciousness  apart from intelligence  is  His  <i>vibhuti</i>
also.
