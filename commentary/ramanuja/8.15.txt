Those who attain Lord Krishna do not  return  to  the  impermanent  material
existence and temporary condition of <i>samsara</i> the perpetual  cycle  of  birth
and death the abode of misery and suffering. The devotees  of  Lord  Krishna
are <i>mahatmas</i> or great, noble souls who have  enlightened  themselves  as  to
the real nature of His <i>nama</i> or name,  <i>rupa</i>  or  form,  <i>guna</i>  or  attributes,
<i>dhama</i> or abode and <i>lila</i> or divine pastimes. Such exalted  beings  feel  such
fervid  love  for  Him  in  separation  that   their   very   life   becomes
unsupportable. Those whose mind are focused on Him and whose heart  is  only
for Him in <i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion is the very heart in which He  resides.
Those who by  incessantly  meditating  upon  Him  will  attain  the  highest
perfection which is the Supreme Lord Krishna. Next  will  be  discussed  why
the <i>arthathi</i> or seeker of  wealth  return  to  material  existence  and  the
<i>bhaktas</i> or  the  devotees  of  Lord  Krishna  are  liberated  from  material
existence.
