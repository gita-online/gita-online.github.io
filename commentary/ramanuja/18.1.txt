The preceding chapters 16 and 17 elaborated the following subjects  by  Lord
Krishna:
1) The only means of achieving the four <i>purusarthas</i>  or  goals  of  human
existence which are <i>kama</i> or  pleasure,  <i>artha</i>  or  wealth<i>,  dharma</i>  or
righteousness and <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence which is
the quintessence of them all is to adhere to and follow the ordinances
and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures by the performance of <i>yagna</i> or
ritualistic propitiation and worship  to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna,
<i>tapah</i> or austerities and penance authorised in  the  Vedic  scriptures
and <i>danam</i> or charity to the Vaisnava Brahmins from  one  of  the  four
bonafide sampradayas as revealed in Vedic scriptures.
2) That all Vedic rituals and observances  are  always  predicated  first
with the <i>pranava</i> OM the transcendental sound vibration of the  Supreme
Lord denoting the first breath making this reverberating hum which the
Sanskrit root is <i>pranu.</i>
3)  The  distinction  of  that  representing  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence and leading to <i>moksa</i> is  symbolised
by TAT and that  representing  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum
pervading physical existence  confering  <i>kama,  artha</i>  and  <i>dharma</i>  is
symbolised by SAT.
4) That <i>yagna</i> or ritualistic propitiation and worship performed  for  the
satisfaction of the Supreme  Lord  when  devoid  of  any  desires  for
rewards becomes successful
5) That those initiated Vaisnava  brahmanas  performing  <i>yagnas</i>  achieved
their  ordainment as a result of the prominence of <i>sattva guna</i> or mode
of goodness permeating their character enhanced by the sole intake  of
only <i>sattvic</i> foods.

In this final chapter Lord Krishna  concisely  delineates  the  following
subject matters:
<i>1) Sannyasa</i> the renunciation of action  and  <i>tyaja</i>  the  renunciation  of
actions rewards
2) The exact nature and mood of <i>tyaja.</i>
3) The comprehension that the Supreme Lord Krishna is the repository  and
agency of everything.
4) A description of the effects of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes  of  material
nature  illustrating  that  <i>sattva  guna</i>  alone  leads  to  <i>moksa</i>   or
liberation from material existence and is thus the only <i>guna</i> worthy of
cultivation.
5) How activities  appropriated  in  the  <i>varnas</i>  or  four  caste  system
indicates the natural propensities of a <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  based
on <i>karma</i> or reactions to past actions are actually authorised acts  of
worship to the Supreme Lord accomplishing His attainment.
6) The quintessential conclusion of the divine discourse Srimad Bhagavad-
Gita is that <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna or any  of  His  authorised  incarnations  and  expansions  as
revealed in Vedic scriptures is the paramount goal of all existence.

The question enquired about is the distinct difference  between  <i>sannyasa</i>
and <i>tyaja</i> as well as their similarities. Both  are  subtle  not  easy  to
understand. Both are situated in renunciation and  both  lead  to  <i>moksa.</i>
Literally <i>sannyasa</i> means putting away and literally  <i>tyaja</i>  means  giving
up. <i>Sannyasa</i> expresses abandonment  of  desires  for  actions  and  <i>tyaja</i>
exhibits the abandonment for the rewards of actions. The Mundaka Upanisad
III.II.VI beginning <i>veda ta vijnano sunisch</i> means:  Those  of  restrained
senses who lead a life  of  renunciation  with  Vedic  knowledge  achieve
liberation. Not by action, not by wealth, not  by  progeny  can  this  be
achieved. Those enlightened  <i>jivas</i>  who  have  ascertained  what  is  the
essence of the Vedic scriptures and assimilating it within  their  hearts
by renunciation dissolve all their <i>karmas</i> and achieve <i>moksa</i> and the final
beatitude. In order to illustrate the nature of both  <i>sannyasa</i> and  <i>tyaja</i>
and prove that they are one and the same Lord Krishna first corrects  the
misapprehension that they are different.
