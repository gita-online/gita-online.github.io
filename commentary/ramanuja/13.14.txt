Here Lord Krishna explains that from the beginning of  time  <i>purusa</i>  or  the
immortal soul  and  <i>prakriti</i>  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence have been  existing  united  together.  The  word  <i>vikarams</i>  means
modifications  and  transformations  this  denotes  non-spiritual   material
attributes and passions. The word <i>gunas</i> or three modes  of  material  nature
being <i>sattva</i> or goodness  with  its  virtues,  <i>rajas</i>  or  passion  with  its
desires and <i>tamas</i> or nescience with its ignorance are  all  by  products  of
<i>prakriti.</i> Virtuous qualities such as reverence and humility are situated  in
<i>sattva</i> and effectuate <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material  existence.  The
qualities of passion with their desires  and  attachments  are  situated  in
<i>rajas</i> and effectuates  bondage  to  material  existence.  The  qualities  of
ignorance with sense gratification as the goal of existence is  situated  in
<i>tamas</i> and effectuates degeneration into  less  evolved  species  next  life.
<i>Purusa</i> uniting with <i>prakriti</i> has been perpetuating since  the  beginning  of
time and expresses itself as a <i>ksetra</i>  or  field  of  activity  which  is  a
physical body. The <i>jiva</i> or embodied being influenced  by  the  modifications
of <i>rajas</i> and <i>tamas</i> in the form of  desire  and  attachment,  attraction  and
aversion, shrouds the <i>atma</i>  or  immortal  soul  and  keeps  it  in  bondage.
Contrarily the <i>jiva</i> being influenced by the modifications of <i>sattva</i>  in  the
form of the 20 super excellent attributes of spiritual  endowment  given  in
verses 8 to 12 headed by reverence and humility  constitutes  the  cause  of
the <i>atma</i> attaining <i>moksa.</i>
