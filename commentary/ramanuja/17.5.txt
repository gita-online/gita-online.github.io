The  word  <i>acetasah</i>  means  indiscriminate.  Such  indiscriminate  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings torture and afflict their own body and the bodies of  others
in the  pursuit  of  fulfilling  their  depraved  and  macabre  rituals  for
dominion over  material  existence.  The  words  <i>raga  balanvitah</i>  means  by
ostentatious displays of mental control and bodily power  in  such  extremes
that even the Supreme Lord feels tormented in His all pervasive form as  the
<i>atma</i> or immortal soul within all living  entities.  The  words  <i>mam  eva  ca</i>
refers specifically to His inner presence. Hence whosoever executes  rituals
that are contrary to the ordinances and injunctions of the Vedic  scriptures
and engages in sacrifices that are prohibited in the  Vedic  scriptures,  or
practices penances which cause great pain and suffering upon themselves  and
others, molest the very elements contained within the body  for its  welfare
to be abused and the <i>atma</i> to be disrespected  are  verily  to  be  known  as
possessing the demoniac nature. The demoniac transgress the  ordinances  and
injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and are  known  as  <i>asuras</i>  which  means
without light denoting without the light of  divine  consciousness.  Due  to
their bellicose and belligerent disposition of opposing  the  Supreme  Lords
commands, the demoniac purposely act contrary in defiance. Because  of  this
they are unable to derive even the most miniscule satisfaction  and  lasting
happiness for their immense efforts.  All they derive  from  their  scheming
conjures of evil actions is accommodation in the hellish planets  direct  at
the conclusion of their life  cycle.  By  their  own  demoniac  actions  and
sinful activities they have voluntarily hurled themselves into such  a  dire
predicament without relief.

Next  Lord  Krishna  will  explain  how  natures  differ  according  to  the
qualities of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material  nature  that  a  <i>jiva</i>  is
situated in and influenced by. As the three <i>gunas</i> are directly  affected  by
the food a <i>jiva</i> chooses to eat and helps determine their present birth.  The
threefold nature of foods as they are situated in one of the three <i>gunas</i>  of
<i>sattva guna, raja guna</i> and <i>tama guna</i> corresponding to the mode of  goodness,
the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance will be described first.  This
is confirmed in the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.V.IV  beginning  <i>anna-mayam  hi</i>
<i>sommya manah</i> it states:  The mind is verily composed of  the  food  that  is
eaten is further confirmed in  verse  VII.XXVI.II  beginning  <i>rahara  shudda</i>
<i>sattva shuddhi</i> which states: Taking pure food in pure  condition  after  its
been first offered to the Supreme Lord. As the purity of the food  eaten  so
is the purity of the mind for pure food enhances the mind with purity.
