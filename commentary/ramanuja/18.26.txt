Now Lord Krishna describes the nature of one performing activities  in  <i>raja</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of passion. One who is <i>ragi</i>  zealously  ambitious  in  seeking
fame,  power,  wealth,  etc.  One  who  is  <i>prepsuh</i>  always  hankering   for
recompense and reward. One who is <i>asucih</i> or impure and greedy,  envious  and
unrighteous causing injury to others by mental and physical cruelty. Such  a
one who is never in equipoise, who rejoices at success but is  depressed  by
failure is indisputably known to be situated in <i>raja guna.</i>
