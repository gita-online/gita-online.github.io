Only humans who are <i>sukritino</i> meaning righteous and  virtuous  surrender  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna becoming exclusively devoted to  Him.  Such  humans
are of four classes distinguished by their different grades  of  virtue.  In
the order they are given each succeeding  class  is  more  superior  to  the
preceding one due  to  being  more  elevated  and  exalted  making  it  more
meritorious. The four are:
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>artto</i> are those impoverished and distressed after losing all  wealth  and
power and desires to have the Supreme Lord recover it for  them  and  re-
instate it.
<p>
<p>
<i>atharthi</i> are those who having never enjoyed power and fortune desire  the
Supreme Lord to give them the ability to acquire them.
<p>
<p>
<i>jijnasur</i> are the seekers of self-realisation who are anxious to know  the
<i>atma</i> or soul in its  state  separate  from  matter  for  the  benefit  of
escaping transmigration the cycle of birth and  death  and  pray  to  the
Supreme Lord for the benediction to discover this.
<p>
<p>
<i>jnani</i> are the seekers  of  knowledge  concerning  the  Supreme  Lord  who
realise that the <i>atma</i>  is  essentially  characterised  by  its  being  an
eternal ingredient of the  Supreme  Lord  residing  within  all  embodied
beings. Such a one considers the Supreme Lord as their goal of  life  and
attainment of Him the fulfilment of all ambitions.
