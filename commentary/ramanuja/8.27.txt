Lord Krishna declares that knowing the archi-adi the path of light which
leads to moksa or liberation from material existence and the path of
darkness which leads to bondage in the material existence there will never
be any infatuation and delusion at the time of death for a yogi or one
perfecting the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion
with the ultimate consciousness. Such a yogi will travel by their own self
earned divine path escorted by the presiding demigods of the path of light.
Thus one should with great faith and enthusiasm meditate on and perform
selfless Vedic activities without desire that keeps one firmly upon this
path. Daily meditation constitutes the proper performance of one's daily
activities as authorised by the bonafide spiritual master either Vaisnava
or Brahmana from one of the four bonafide  sampradayas as revealed in Vedic
scriptures.
