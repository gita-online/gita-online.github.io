Lord Krishna reveals that His <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental opulence  is
<i>sarganam</i> or creation. Creation is the total sum of all things  in  existence
and the Supreme Lord Krishna is the beginning or origin of all,  the  middle
or preservation of all and the end or dissolution of all being  the  creator
of everything. Of the three forms of debate and arguement His <i>vibhuti</i>  known
as <i>vadah</i> is the discriminating debate  that  results  in  knowledge  of  the
absolute conclusive truth. This is in opposition  to  the  other  two  forms
being <i>jalpa</i> which is an argument calculated to  destroy  the  opposition  at
any cost even by deception and falsehood. The other is  <i>vintanda</i>  whose  aim
is  to  criticize  and  undermine  the  oppositions  position  without  ever
establishing any position.
