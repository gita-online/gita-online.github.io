The use of the name Vasudeva the  son  of  Vasudeva  in  referring  to  Lord
Krishna denotes how the Supreme  Lord  deigns  to  manifest  His  completely
spiritual body in human form with a father and mother like any  other  human
in order to conceal His supreme divinity. The use of the word Partha  refers
to Arjuna as the son of Pritha who is Vasudeva's sister and  Lord  Krishna's
paternal aunt. This relationship illustrates  how  deeply  and  dearly  Lord
Krishna loves all His creation. The word <i>mahatma</i> meaning great  soul  refers
to Lord Krishna being <i>paramatma</i> the supreme soul existing simultaneously  in
the etheric hearts of every living entity. It can also refer to  Arjuna  who
heeding the advice and instructions of Lord  Krishna  has  become  eminently
wise in <i>tvatvam</i> eternal spiritual verities.
