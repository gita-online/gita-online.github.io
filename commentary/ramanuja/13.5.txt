The <i>maha-bhutani</i> which  are  the  fundamental  elements  of  creation  being
earth, water, fire, air and ether along with the <i>ahankara</i> or false ego,  the
<i>buddhi</i> or intellect and the <i>avyaktam</i> the primordial root  which  in  essence
is <i>prakriti</i> or the material  substratum  pervading  physical  existence  and
from whom the fore mentioned emanate as the germinating foundations  of  the
<i>ksetra</i>  in  different  manifestations  and  modifications  of  an   evolving
process. The five perceptual senses being the eyes, ears, nose,  tongue  and
touch corresponding respectively with their five objects being  the  visual,
auditory, olfactory, gustatory and tactual; along with the  five  senses  of
activity being the vocal, the prehensible  the  hands,  the  locomotive  the
legs,  procreative  the  generative  organs  and  the  excretory  organ  for
evacuation. The one known  as  the  internal  sense  is  the  mind.  Desire,
aversion, joy and affliction are considered modifications of the  <i>ksetra</i>  as
they are solely products of the mind influenced  by  moods  and  affections.
The words <i>sanghatas cetana dhrtih</i> means  the  perceptual  faculties  of  the
mind and includes  the  physical  body.  The  words  <i>catana  dritih</i>  denotes
<i>adritah</i> inferring <i>adharah</i> which means the basis, the medium for  fundamental
ingredients. The word <i>sanghata</i> meaning the physical body  is  the  aggregate
expression of the collocated ingredients that are utilised.
<p>
The  ultimate  purpose  is  to  utilise  the  physical  body   to   interact
harmoniously with the mind and intellect to realise  the  eternal  principle
inside the heart in the form of the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul and  the  path  to
the Supreme Lord. Otherwise one will misuse their  precious  human  form  of
existence to procure material happiness on Earth while experiencing joy  and
grief in doing so and take another birth  in  usually  a  lower  species  of
life; or to perform activities in an attempt to procure  entrance  into  the
heavenly planets to enjoy celestial delights as a demigod  for  an  allotted
time period but which may or may not guarantee success and  one  has  to  be
born again; or to strive for <i>moksa</i> or liberation from  the  cycle  of  birth
and death to achieve an impersonal beatitude  but  if  failing  in  this  is
forced to take birth again in one of  the  8,400,000  some  species  in  the
material existence as well.
<p>
This is what is available in the <i>ksetra.</i>  All  of  its  characteristics  and
attributes are manifested out of <i>prakriti</i> the material substratum  pervading
physical existence and is the foundation of  the mind and  all  the  senses.
It is the compound which gives rise to the change  of  temperament  such  as
desire and aversion, happiness and misery and the medium by which  the  <i>jiva</i>
or embdied being experiences  pleasure,  pain,  joy  and  grief,  etc.  This
concludes Lord Krishna concise exposition on the <i>ksetra</i> with its  variations
and modifications.
<p>
Next the virtues and attributes that will enable one to  obtain  <i>atma-tattva</i>
or knowledge of the immortal soul which is connected to the  <i>ksetrajna</i>  will
be enumerated by Lord Krishna.
