This knowledge and wisdom  which  the  great  sages  possess  is  what  Lord
Krishna is elaborating about in this  chapter.  The  words  <i>mama  sadharmyam</i>
means endowed with a similar divine eternality like the  Supreme  Lord.  The
word <i>sarge</i> meaning creation denotes the  time  of  beginning  and  the  word
<i>pralaye</i> denotes the time  of  dissolution.  Those  who  have  acquired  this
knowledge and realised its wisdom having transcended are  exempt  from  both
and subject to neither birth or death.  The explanation of how all  existing
beings result in their forms by the combination of  matter  and  spirit  and
how the qualities of <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum pervading  physical
existence come to manifest was already eloquently delineated in  chapter  13
verse 22.
