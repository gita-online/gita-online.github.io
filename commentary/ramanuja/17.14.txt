The words <i>aphala-akanksibhih</i> means those who have  no  desire  for  rewards.
Those devout and evolved <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings  with  ardent  faith,  who
are imbued  with  the  consciousness  that  all  their  actions  are  humble
offerings of worship rendered to the Supreme Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His
authorized incarnations and expansions  as  revealed  in  Vedic  scriptures;
performing the three aforementioned  types  of  austerity  of  the  physical
body, speech and mind are known to be in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.
