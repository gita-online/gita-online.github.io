The word <i>hi</i> means indeed, in as much aa when by propitiated by never erring
<i>bhakti yoga</i> or intense loving devotion, the Supreme Lord Krishna personally
manifests Himself to His surrendered devotee who has no other refuge but
Him.
<p>
The words <i>sasvatasya dharmasya</i> mean the sublime equisite spiritual
happiness that comes in asociation with the Supreme Lord and His devotees.
Although the concept of <i>dharma</i> usually means the eternal spiritual
principles promulgated in the Vedic scriptures implying the means to
accomplish a goal. In this verse it is the goal be that it occurs betweeen
two other expressions of goals one being <i>brahmano hi prastisthalam</i> which
refers to the <i>atma</i> or realising the soul and the othe being <i>aikantikasya</i>
<i>sukhasya</i> realising the Supreme Lord.
The words <i>aikantikasya sukhasya</i> means the absolute nature of never ending
bliss with the Supreme Lord which is the natural result of <i>bhakti yoga.</i>
<p>
The essence is that exclusive loving devotion unto the Supreme Lord Krishna
or any of His authorised <i>avataras</i> as revealed in Vedic scriptures is the
only way to transcend the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature and
sincere prayers offerred to Him from hearts over flowing with love is the
essential means for Him to reciprocate and grace us with His mercy.
