In the very next reincarnation such a practicer of <i>yoga</i> or  the  science  of
the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate
consciousness is propelled by the impressions of the previous birth  and  is
drawn by the habits cultivated in their previous  existence.  Like  one  who
while performing  a  task  slumbers  briefly  but  when  roused  from  sleep
enthusiastically continues onwards to finishing  it.  In  the  same  way  in
their next birth such  a  practicer  of  <i>yoga</i>    enthusiastically  continues
onwards in perfecting <i>yoga</i> from where they left off in  the  previous  life.
Lord Krishna is declaring that the influence  of  <i>yoga</i>  and  the  past  life
habits involving <i>yoga</i> are so potent that they impel such a person  in  their
next life to gravitate towards <i>yoga</i> instinctively and intuitively as  if  it
were not in one's  power  to  resist.   Verily  the  majesty  and  greatness
of <i>yoga</i> is well known to be such.
