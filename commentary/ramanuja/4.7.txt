No fixed time schedule has  been  mandated  for  Lord  Krishna  to  manifest
Himself in His <i>avatar</i> forms  or  authorised  incarnations  but  he  declares
beginning with <i>yada yada</i> which means that: whenever or  wherever  <i>dharma</i>  or
righteousness as ordained by the Vedic scriptures under  <i>varnasrama</i>  or  the
four  stages  and  position   in   Vedic   culture   become   degraded   and
unrighteousness increases and becomes dominant at that time Lord Krishna  or
any of His authorised incarnations descends and becomes manifest. It  should
be noted that all the names of His <i>avatars</i> or incarnations are  recorded  in
the Bhagavat Purana and othe Vedic scriptures  with  additional  details  so
that it can be proven when His divine incarnation has manifested.
