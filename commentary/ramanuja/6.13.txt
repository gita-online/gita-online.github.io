Attaining communion with the Supreme Lord means linking one's  consciousness
in constant concentration on Him, who is the most  sacred  reality  and  the
highest divinity for which the mind  can  concentrate  upon.  Discipline  of
mind means being fixed and equiposed by dint of the purification one's  mind
receives from association with  devotees  of  the  Supreme  Lord  and  their
contact with Him. Such a person assumes that peace and  understanding  which
has <i>nirvana-paramam</i> or the supreme bliss of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  for  its
result. This <i>moksa</i> is only resulting from contact with  the  Supreme  Being.
Thus after declaring how one who would want to  commence  meditation  should
meditate upon the Supreme Being, this holy of  holiest  subject  is  further
explained by Lord Krishna with supplement directions in order to aid one  in
concentration, purification and meditation.
