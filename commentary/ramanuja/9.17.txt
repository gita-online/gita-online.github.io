It is the Supreme Lord Krishna who is  the  foundation  and  source  of  all
creation comprised of moving and non-moving things  hence  His  relationship
as father, mother, grandsire  and  patriarch  is  natural.  The  word  <i>dhata</i>
meaning  bequeather  or  dispenser  denotes  the  original   progenitor  the
Supreme Lord who is the real cause of all births distinct from  the  seminal
birth from father and mother. He is <i>vedyam</i> whatever is  perceptible  by  the
Vedas being worthy to be known and He is the  Holy  sanctifier.  He  is  the
indicator known by His personal sound vibration OM which is the root of  the
Vedas and He Himself is the sacred Vedas comprised of the Rig, Sama and  the
Yajur Vedas from where was extracted the Atharva Veda.
