The aforementioned descriptions of knowledge, action,  performer,  etc.  are
all utilised for  the  purpose  and  intention  of  obtaining  happiness  as
influenced by the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature. Now Lord  Krishna
reveals that the <i>sukham</i> or happiness  that  one  becomes  habituated  to  by
constant endeavour gradually deriving exquisite pleasure  at  the  cessation
of misery with the termination of <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of  birth  and
death. Such <i>sukham</i> is achieved by industrious effort  right  from  its  very
commencement with the <i>yoga</i> of meditation and <i>pranayama</i>  breathing  exercises
which bring the mind and senses under control. The singular,  unique  nature
of such <i>sukham</i> never having been experienced seems to be like venom  in  the
beginning, but in the end  after  a  lifetime  of  devotional  practice  its
unique, sublime nature becomes  just  like  nectar.  Such  happiness  arises
solely  from  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  immortal   soul.   The
consciousness of one which is absorbed in the <i>atma</i> is one  who  can  realise
the <i>atma.</i> The bliss of  tranquillity  and  serenity  is  experienced  within
after all conceptions  and  designations  have  been  renounced  except  the
<i>atma.</i> It is by such renunciation that the <i>atma</i> is perceived and  its  <i>ananda</i>
or bliss  experienced  and  it  is  this  <i>ananda</i>  that  awards  the  highest
happiness and such <i>sukham</i> is like nectar and situated  in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the
mode of goodness.
