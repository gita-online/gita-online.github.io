Lord Krishna is declaring that whatever desire diverted one from  continuing
on the  path  of  <i>yoga</i>  or  the  science  of  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness. Such desire  will  find
its fulfilment and  be  exquisitely  enhanced  manifold  in  the  delightful
spheres of those who performed virtuous  deeds.  There  one  enjoys  to  the
utmost limit of their capacity extending over a long duration of time.  This
all happens by virtue of the <i>yoga</i> one began but was unable to  finish.  When
one's time limit for enjoyment has come to an end one incarnates  and  takes
birth in a pious and wealthy family already practising  <i>yoga</i>  at  the  stage
where one discontinued in their previous life. To be thus  born  in  such  a
favourable environment is due to the potency and efficacy of the  this  <i>yoga</i>
which was commenced but not completed.
