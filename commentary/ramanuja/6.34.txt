No matter how much one may ever so enthusiastically embark on  the  path  of
<i>yoga</i> or the science of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion
with the ultimate consciousness; if one lacks the  sufficient  determination
to maintain the persistent application  of  regulated  discipline  the  mind
will inevitably be distracted and deviate and one will fail  to  succeed  in
reaching perfection in <i>yoga.</i> What will be the fate of such  a  person?  Will
they perish like a divided cloud in the sky leaving the  rest  behind  while
failing to unite with the cloud in front of it  in  the  distance?  What  is
meant by double loss? The word <i>apratistho</i> means unfixed  situation  and  the
words <i>vimudho brahmanah pathi</i> means baffled due to ignorance of the  <i>Brahman</i>
or the spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence  which  is  the  first
cognition on the way to achieving enlightenment.
<p>
The first loss is failure to secure <i>svarga loka</i> or the heavenly planets  for
executing the appropriate actions.  Prescribed  Vedic  activities  performed
with the goal of residing in <i>svarga loka</i> liberally reward one's efforts  and
allows one to enjoy heavenly delights for as long a  time  as  one's  merits
warrant. But actions performed by persons without such intent do not  enable
a person to reside there hence one forfeits  the  opportunity  for  heavenly
pleasures. The second loss is ignorance of the path  of  the  <i>Brahman</i>  which
includes  performing  selfless  actions  without  desire  for  reward  while
contemplating on the <i>atma</i> or soul. But the person who  fails  to  pursue  it
consistently and steadfastly will deviate and stray away and  will  lose  in
both instances. So Arjuna wants Lord Krishna to alleviate his doubts.
