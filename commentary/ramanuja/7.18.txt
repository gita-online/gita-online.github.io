Due to the fact that the previous four classes all  resort  to  the  Supreme
Lord, they are all noble and <i>udarah</i> or magnanimous  inasmuch  as  when  they
receive any benediction from Him it is as by their loving act of  acceptance
that the Supreme Lord  feels  bliss  and  is  truly  grateful  to  them  for
accepting His love. Lord Krishna considers the <i>jnani</i> or the  knower  of  God
as dear to Him as His own self and considers even that  His  very  existence
depends upon them. One may question how is this to be understood?  One  must
understand that the Supreme Lord reciprocates in  the  same  manner  as  His
devotee acts towards Him. Thus in the same way that His devotee cannot  live
without Him, He cannot live without His devotee. Therefore His devotee  <i>atma</i>
or soul realised is His very life as the <i>atma.</i>
