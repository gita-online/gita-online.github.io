In the previous three chapters the topics  explained  by  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna were:
1) The essential nature of physical matter and  spirit  as  the  <i>atma</i>  or
immortal soul.
2) The fact that when the <i>atma</i> and physical matter are conjoined it is  a
result due to attachment to the <i>gunas</i>  or  three  modes  of   material
nature and when the <i>atma</i> is independent of matter it is a result   due
to being unattached to the <i>gunas.</i>
3)  That  both  the  <i>atma</i>  and  physical  matter  in  whatever  condition
constitute two distinct aspects of the Supreme Lord's potencies.
4) That the Supreme Lord  as  the  source  of  all  that  exists  yet  is
factually distinct and separate from all aspects of His creation  both
<i>achit</i> or matter and <i>chit</i> or spirit which  are  contained  within  Him.
This includes every <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  being  in  all  creation;  both
<i>baddha-jivas</i> who are bound and  <i>mukta-jivas</i>  who  are  liberated.  The
Supreme Lord possesses all transcendental and divine powers  such  as:
immortality,  sovereignty,  omnipotence,  omniscience,  omni-presence,
etc.

Lord Krishna will substantiate the  reality  of  what  has  previously  been
declared in accordance to  the  ordinances  and  injunctions  of  the  Vedic
scriptures which are the absolute authority. This is done  by  initiating  a
comparison between the divine nature  and  the  demoniac  nature  as  it  is
verified  throughout  creation.  The  divine   nature   expresses   complete
allegiance to righteousness and adherence to  the  authority  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. The demoniac nature does not follow righteousness, neither  does
it accept  the  absolute  authority  of  the  Vedic  scriptures;  contrarily
adopting  inauspicious   activities   befitting   impure   concoctions   and
unrighteous conceptions.

purity of heart consisting of pure goodness undefiled with  the  taint
of passion and ignorance.

The divine qualities and nature are for those  aspiring  to  activate  their
divinity  following  the  time  tested  eternal,   divine   ordinances   and
injunctions as  revealed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  by  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna. Their virtues of these 26 qualities are revealed by following  them
and living them in this manner. The word <i>abhijatasya</i>  refers  to  those  who
were born with the divine nature destined to follow the divine path and  who
are naturally in harmony with divinity.
