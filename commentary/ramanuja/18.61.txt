<i>Manmana bhava</i> is a divine command that means to  always  have  Lord  Krishna
completely and blissfully in one's thoughts, to absorb oneself in Him.  This
is  also  established  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  where  we  find  in   the
Taittiriyaranyaka Upanisad  III.XII  beginning  <i>vedaham  etam</i>  stating:  The
Resplendent Supreme Lord more radiant then thousands of suns is realised  by
absorbing the mind in Him by  meditation.  Realising  Him  Him  one  attains
<i>moksa</i> liberation from material existence. There  exists  no  other  path  to
immortality.  This  devotional  absorption  in  Lord  Krishna  is  of   such
magnitude and intensity that its meditation becomes a vision and the  vision
becomes an ever flowing current of  devotion  that  is  so  vivid  that  the
experience actually enters the realm of reality.
<p>
<i>Mad-bhakta</i> is to offer all one's loving emotions to Lord Krishna  enthralled
by love overflowing with enthusiasm, exuberance and excitement.
<p>
<i>Mad-yagi</i> is to worship Lord Krishna with  love.  To  install  Him  in  one's
heart as their personal worshipable diety. Such worship is  the  performance
of the entire services that a liege administers to His sovereign on a  daily
basis  upon  waking  untill  sleeping.  <i>Yagi</i>  comes  from  <i>yajana</i>  which  is
synonymous with <i>pujana</i> or worship and denotes <i>aradhanam</i>  the  most  equisite
loving worship. Therefore it is  not  a  mere  dry,  formal  observation  of
ceremonial ritual enacted out of duty. It is love flowing  from  the  heart.
It is a testament of devotion from the eternal  <i>svarupa</i>  or  one's  immortal
spiritual form. <i>Mad yagi</i> should be interpreted as  offering  one's  self  to
Lord Krishna as a brother, as a parent or as a beloved with a heart full  of
love.
<p>
<i>Mam namaskuru</i> is to enshrine Lord Krishna in  the  heart  with  the  utmost,
love, devotion and faith. <i>Namas</i> comes from <i>namanam</i> meaning  obeisance.  Such
obeisance is not a mere habitual genuflexion; but a  sublime  expression  of
sincere gratitude and humility that constitutes  an  emotion  of  love  felt
internally.
<p>
If a blessed devotee of Lord  Krishna  arrives  at  this  exalted  vista  of
<i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion then the Supreme Lord will not  hesitate
to have their eternal  individual  association  with  Him  in  the  immortal
spiritual worlds. This is the truth that  He  Himself  promises.  It  should
never be interpreted as being just a metaphor or mere flowery prose. Such  a
hypothesis would not be genuine and incorrect.
<p>
Wherever there is a heart that has so much love for Lord Krishna then  there
is as much love from Lord Krishna back to them. Lord Krishna's love is  such
that He finds it impossible to bear the  separation  from  such  surrendered
and dedicated devotees and therefore  without  delay  He  personally  brings
them to Him directly in  their  eternal  spiritual  body  even  while  their
physical body is concluding its last life in material existence.
<p>
So it should be clearly and emphatically understood that  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna's solemn promise to His surrendered devotees is the total truth  and
nothing other than truth  for  which  He  pledges  to  vouch  safe  for  His
devotees for all eternity.
