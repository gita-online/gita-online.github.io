Lord Krishna emphasises that never under any  circumstances  are  prescribed
Vedic activities such as <i>yagna</i>  or  ritualistic  propitiation  and  worship,
<i>tapah</i> or penance and austerities and <i>danam</i> or charity to the  Vaisnavas  and
brahmanas ever to be abdicated. They  must  be  continuously  performed  all
through the life some daily and others occasionally up until the  moment  of
death. The reason for this is  that  prescribed  Vedic  activities  situated
purely in <i>sattva guna</i> or mode of goodness duly purify the performer and  all
involved especially those in <i>varna asrama</i> or the natural four  divisions  of
society which are Vaisnava and Brahmin  the  spiritual  class,  <i>ksatriya</i>  or
royal and warrior class, <i>vaisya</i>  or  agricultural  and  commerce  class  and
<i>sudra</i> the worker class. They also upgrade the general consciousness  of  the
world  in  general.   The  performance  of   prescribed   Vedic   activities
dissolves all impurities and eradicates the <i>karmas</i> or reactions  to  actions
from past activities. The word <i>manisinam</i> means the wise, the  conscientious,
those whose consciousness is evolved in a spiritual  sense.  Such  aspirants
reflecting upon spiritual attainment throughout their  lives  are  naturally
in communion with the Supreme Lord at the moment of death.
