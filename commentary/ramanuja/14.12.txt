Lord Krishna now describes what is indicative of passion with the  following
words.
<p>
<p>
The word <i>lobha</i> means greed, avarice, parsimony regarding wealth.
<p>
<p>
The word <i>pravritih</i> means restlessness with no specific purpose or reason.
<p>
<p>
The word <i>arambhah</i> means engaging in fruitive activities.
<p>
<p>
The word <i>asamah</i> means agitation of the senses.
<p>
<p>
The  word <i>spriha</i> means craving for sense gratification.
<p>
<p>
All of these qualities manifest when <i>raja guna</i> or the  mode  of  passion  is
predominant.
