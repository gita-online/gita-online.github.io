It should  be  understood  that  the  soul  is  indestructible  and  is  the
principle by which the physical body is permeated. The  insentient  body  is
completely distinct from the sentient  soul.  By  reason  of  its  pervasive
nature the soul is very subtle, in fact so exceedingly subtle  is  the  soul
that it is verily incapable of being destroyed being subatomic  in  essence.
There is no thing which is of different or of a dissimilar  nature  from  it
which in any way is capable of destroying the soul. For  whatever  there  is
existing is pervaded by the soul as well and  being  pervaded  by  the  soul
itself verifies its less  gross  and  most  subtle  position  of  all  being
subatomic. Such things as weapons, water,  fire,  air,  cold  etc.  can  not
influence or be the agents of destruction for the imperishable  soul,  being
all pervaded by it.

The rationale of a hammer striking an object and disintegrating  it  is  now
given. When a hammer strikes an  object  with  excessive  force  an  extreme
vibration produces a molecular disruption which causes  the  destruction  of
the object.  But  in  the  case  of  the  soul  there  is  no  facility  for
destruction as when light penetrates a glass jar is not destroyed  when  the
glass is destroyed; similarly the soul is like unto this in relation to  the
body. Thus it can be understood the imperishable nature of the soul.

Now the next verse explains that being perishable is the very nature of  the
physical body.
