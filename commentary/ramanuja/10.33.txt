Lord Krishna reveals that among the hymns in  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  His  divine,
transcendental opulence the Sama Veda, His foremost <i>vibhuti</i> is  the  Brihat-
sama  which  is  a  special  prayer  that  is  indicated  in  the  Rig  Veda
VI.XXXXVI.I beginning <i>tvam rddhim havamahe</i> and glorifies the post  of  Indra
the ruler of all the demigods during the time when the Supreme Lord  Himself
assumes that position as He did in the case of  His  manavatara  incarnation
of Dharmasetu. The word <i>marga-sirsah</i> refers to harvesting  month  of  grains
which  is  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  and  the  word  <i>rtunam</i>   means   season   and   the
word <i>kusumakarah</i> means flowery which means His <i>vibhuti</i> is the springtime.
