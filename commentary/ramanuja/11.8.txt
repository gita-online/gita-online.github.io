Lord Krishna is exclaiming to behold His cosmic glory as  all  existence  is
contained within a small space of His <i>visvarupa</i> or  divine  universal  form.
But He instructs Arjuna that with his physical eyes which  are  limited  and
only conditioned to see mundane material objects, he will  not  be  able  to
have its transcendental vision which is fantastic,  phenomenal  and   beyond
measure and comparison. Because of  this  limitation  Lord  Krishna  confers
upon him <i>divyam</i> or spiritual vision making his eyes capable  of  seeing  the
universal form. Lord Krishna states <i>pasya me yogam aisvaram</i>  or  behold  His
almighty,  transcendental  mystic  opulence.   The   word   <i>aisvaram</i>   means
unparalleled, extraordinary opulence. The word <i>yogam</i> denotes the  assemblage
and  conglomeration  of  all  divine  qualities  and  attributes   such   as
omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, etc. It also denotes the refuge  and
embodiment  of  all  displayed  and  as  yet  to  be  displayed  magnificent
opulence.
