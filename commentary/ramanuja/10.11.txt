The Supreme Lord Krishna is He whom all the Vedic  scriptures   proclaim  as
<i>param brahma</i> the Supreme Ultimate Truth, <i>param dhama</i>  the  Supreme  Ultimate
Shelter and <i>pavitram paramam</i> the Supreme Purifier. The  Taittiriya  Upanisad
III.I.I beginning <i>yato va imani  bhutani  jayante</i>  states:  Search  for  Him
alone from whom all existence arises, upon whom all beings  exist  and  into
whom they enter and merge. He the Supreme  Lord  is  <i>param  brahma</i>  and  the
Tattiriya Upanisad II.I.I beginning <i>brahma  vid  apnoti  param</i>  states:  The
knower of <i>param brahma</i>  attains the  Supreme  State.  The  Mundaka  Upanisad
III.II.IX beginning <i>sa yo ha vai tat param brahma</i> states:  Is  not  one  who
realises <i>param brahma</i>  infused  with  awareness  of  <i>brahman</i>  the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. The Mundaka Upanisad III.II.I  beginning
<i>sa vedaitat paramam  dhama</i>  states:  <i>Param  dhama</i>  equals  <i>param  jyotih</i>  or
supernal transcendental divine light. The  Chandogya  Upanisad  III.XIII.VII
beginning <i>atha yad atah paro divo, jyotir  dipyate</i>  states:  Now  above  all
that is perceived the supernal transcendental  divine  light  shines  forth.
The Chandogya Upanisad VIII:III.IV beginning <i>param jyotir upasampadya  svena</i>
<i>rupena</i> states: Reaching unto the supernal, transcendental, divine light  one
resurrects themselves into their own essential spiritual  nature.  Similarly
<i>paramam pavitram</i> the Supreme Holy sanctifier, the Supreme Lord who  purifies
His devotees of all sins. The sins of <i>purvagha</i> one committed in the past  as
well as the sins of <i>uttaragha</i> which may be  committed  in  the  future.  The
Chandogya  Upanisad  IV.XIV.III  beginning   <i>yatha   pushkara   palasa   apo</i>
<i>naslishyanta evam</i> states: As water is not able to wet the lotus  leaf,  evil
is not able to influence one who has realised  the  Supreme.  The  Chandogya
Upanisad V.XXIV.III beginning <i>tad yatheshika-tulam agnau</i> states: As the  tip
of a reed cast into a fire is at once burnt to  ashes,  so  indeed  are  the
sins of one who has realised the Supreme Being become consumed.

All the <i>mahatmanas</i> or great, liberated sages such as Narada  and  Vyasa  who
possess enlightened cognition of truths both eternal and temporary,  declare
that Lord Krishna  is  the  Eternal,  Omniscient,  Omnipotent,  Omnipresent,
Supreme Absolute Truth and Ultimate Attainment. Wherever  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna has been  present  that  world  becomes  highly  blest  and  accrues
eternal benedictions forever. Those who are knowledgeable about the  meaning
of the Vedic scriptures and who have realised the ultimate spiritual  truths
declare Lord Krishna to be the Supreme Absolute Truth. Of all  purifiers  He
is the most pure and sanctifying. Of all  the  virtuous  indeed  He  is  the
Supreme virtue and of things auspicious He is the origin  and  generator  of
all that is auspicious. Wherever the Supreme Lord Krishna is present or  any
of His incarnations and  expansions  authorised  by  Vedic  scriptures  then
there all the universes, all the cosmos, all sacred places and all  creation
also abide. There should be no doubt  whatsoever  about  this.  The  Supreme
Lord Krishna is the sole  origin  and  sole  conclusion  of  all  realities.
Arjuna now exclaims that Lord Krishna Himself  has  also  corroborated  what
the <i>mahatmanas</i> have proclaimed earlier in chapter  seven,  verse  four  that
all the elements of material  existence  for  all  objects  and  all  beings
manifest from His seperated eightfold  energies  which  are:  earth,  water,
fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. Also in verse  eight  of
this chapter Lord Krishna explains that He is original generating  cause  of
all causes. So this points are implicitly clear.
