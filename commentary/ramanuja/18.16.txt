The word <i>ahankarah</i> means the ego and refers to  one  who  thinks  themselves
the doer of actions. It is an erroneous figment of the mind that  illusorily
attaches itself to one's own self the conviction that:  I  myself  am  doing
such and such action. This false notion arises out  of  identification  with
the false ego and infatuation  to  a  bodily  conception.  Such  notion  and
conceptions are completely absent in those  of  spiritual  intelligence  who
have surrendered themselves to the Supreme Lord. The words <i>na lipyate</i>  means
not attached to the rewards of actions. Since one of spiritual  intelligence
understands that they are never independent they realise  that  the  rewards
from their actions is not of their  concern.  Hence  they  do  not  consider
themselves the doer and are solely dependent upon the  Supreme  Lord.  Whose
intelligence has been refined in this manner is known  to  be  purified  and
untainted. The inference  is  that  although  one  may  perform  innumerable
activities they perform them not because  they  are  bereft  of  considering
themselves the doer they are not subject to be a recipient  to  receive  the
consequent merits  or  demerits  resulting  from  any  action.  This  highly
evolved consciousness of being fully dependent upon  the  Supreme  Lord  and
never considering oneself as the doer of any action arises out of a <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being prevalence of <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness. Therefore  it
is  a  virtuous  trait  and  worthy  of  acquisition  to  be  cultured   and
implemented. Next the differentiation of actions resulting from  interaction
and influences of the three <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature  will  be
examined by Lord Krishna in detail to illustrate from where  the  inducement
and incentive to perform actions arises.
