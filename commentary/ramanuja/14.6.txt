The characteristics given by Lord Krishna of <i>sattva</i> or the mode of  goodness
within the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature is that it  is  pure  and
lucid and  shines  brightly.  Purity  and  clarity  is  that  which  negates
obscuration of brightness and happiness. As illumination and  happiness  can
only result from <i>sattva</i> it  is  understood  to  be  their  cause.  The  word
<i>prakasakam</i> means illuminates, enlightens, reveals the  exact  knowledge  of.
The word <i>anamayam</i> means of peaceful quality,  that  which  has  no  inherent
cause for producing discomfort, pain or sickness  denoting  that  <i>sattva</i>  is
the cause of good health. The quality of <i>sattva</i>  produces  in  the  <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being the predisposition for  happiness  and  knowledge.  When  the
dispositions for happiness and knowledge arise  in  life  one  embarks  upon
such worldly material enterprises and spiritual pursuits  as  correlates  to
the level of one's developement and evolution. Hence the <i>jiva</i>  is  propelled
to take birth in such wombs that are favorably suited fot the  enjoyment  of
one's <i>karma</i> or resultant reactions to actions which arising  out  of  <i>sattva</i>
are positive. Born in <i>sattva</i> the inclinations and disposition that  one  has
again gravitates towrds happiness and knowledge and in this way lifetime  by
lifetime in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness  one  has  the  opportunity  to
advance in spiritual life. But this opportunity is not accessible  to  those
born in the two inferior <i>gunas</i> of <i>rajas</i> or passion and  <i>tamas</i>  or  ignorance
as will be described next.
