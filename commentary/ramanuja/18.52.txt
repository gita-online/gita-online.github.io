All prescribed Vedic activities even the ones  that  are  performed  out  of
<i>kamya</i> or craving a result, if offered as worship of the  Supreme  Lord  with
full faith in Him understanding that He  alone  is  the  Supreme  controller
will inevitably attain the Supreme state  of  eternal  communion  with  Lord
Krishna which is <i>sasvatam</i> timeless and <i>avyayam</i> infinte.
