Lord Krishna is revealing the eternal truth that He  is  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul
within all beings in existence, be they human, animal, aquatic, plant, demi-
gods or  any  other  species  of  life  that  was  not  cloned.  He  is  the
maintainer, sustainer and monitor of all beings through the  medium  of  the
<i>atma</i> and all of its impulses come from  Him.  All  souls  emanate  from  the
Supreme Lord and because of Him are completely spiritual  and  eternal.  All
the souls of all the living beings in creation everywhere in creation  as  a
total  aggregate  comprise  the  form  of  the   Supreme   Lord's   eternal,
transcendental  spiritual  body.  Whoever  does  not  avail  themselves  and
conformably act to this eternal truth, or take this eternal truth  seriously
in earnest, or who deems unnecessary and not worth the effort,  this  person
should be understood to be completely destitute of knowledge and  unable  to
evolve spiritually and are  incapable of achieving <i>atma tattva</i> or  knowledge
of the soul become lost.  Spiritual  intelligence  is  what  determines  the
light of knowledge in the material existence. In the  absence  of  spiritual
knowledge, darkness and ignorance prevails and knowledge  becomes  erroneous
and defective. Thus it has been illustrated that doership transpires due  to
the union of <i>prakriti</i>  or  material  nature  and  the  physical  body  being
influenced by the <i>gunas</i> or modes of  goodness,  passion  and  nescience  and
this is dependent ultimately upon the Supreme Lord.

Reflecting in this manner it can be ascertained that <i>karma yoga</i> or the  path
of performing prescribed Vedic actions is  appropriate  for  one  performing
<i>jnana yoga</i> or the path of cultivating Vedic knowledge as  well.  <i>Karma  yoga</i>
is appropriate on account of it being  easy  to  perform,  exempt  from  the
danger of failure and requires no  assistance  from  other  methods  in  its
application. Contrarily <i>jnana yoga</i> is difficult to practice, susceptible  to
failure and must perform some <i>karma yoga</i> anyway in order to maintain  health
and vigor which is essential for body maintenance if one is to  perform  any
yoga at all. Also it has been pointed out how it is necessary for  a  person
of distinction situated in Vedic wisdom to set an  example  to  inspire  the
common man for the benefit and welfare of the world.
