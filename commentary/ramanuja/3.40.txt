The senses, the mind and the intellect  which  controls  the  discriminatory
faculty, is where <i>kama</i> or lust covertly resides and exercises  its  dominion
over the <i>atma</i> or soul. Through <i>kama</i> the senses, the mind and  the  intellect
become addicted to craving for  sense  objects.  <i>Kama</i>  seizes  hold  of  the
embodied beings and beguiles them by clouding the intellect  and  then  <i>kama</i>
covers and envelopes the <i>atma</i> or soul of that being in  many  ways  and  who
subsequently becomes <i>kama's</i> slave doing anything to gratify its  senses  and
is plunged into the prison garden  of  sense  objects.  This  is  what  Lord
Krishna is stating here.
