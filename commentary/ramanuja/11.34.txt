The word <i>sthane</i> means appropriate or most worthy. Who is  most  worthy?  The
Lord Krishna is the most worthy. What  is  appropriate?  It  is  appropriate
that all the hosts of heavenly beings including the <i>Devas</i> or  demigods,  the
<i>Gandharvas, Siddhas,  Yakshas,  Vidyadharas,  Kinnaras,  Kimpurushas</i>  should
have come to witness the astounding spectacle of Lord  Krishna  the  Supreme
Lord of all displaying Himself by the request of His devotee  as  charioteer
in the battle of Kuruksetra and to appropriately admire  His  greatness  and
praise His unmatched compassion to manifest Himself for them to see  by  His
grace and to subsequently rejoice and revel at the phenomenal  glory  of  it
all. How could they not  <i>anurajyate</i> or feel  devotion  this  way  about  the
Supreme Lord who is their originator and omit to give Him who is  worthy  of
every adulation, full glorification. To the contrary it is also  appropriate
that the unrighteous <i>raksasas</i> or demons  should  be  dejected,  disheartened
and fearful, fleeing in all directions.
