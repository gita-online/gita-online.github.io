To adhere to one's own natural path of <i>dharma</i> or righteousness  is  what  is
being emphasised by Lord Krishna here. It is not as if one must  follow  the
path of another. Everyone is entitled to perform those activities  that  are
appropriate for their  rank  and  station  in  life  in  constituting  their
propitiation to the Supreme Lord;  but  one  must  eliminate  all  sense  of
doership and desire for rewards. Such <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  actions  facilitating
communion with the Supreme absolute expressed in  visible  activities  which
conform to the  inherent  nature  of  the  individual  manifest  easily  and
naturally. Thus <i>karma yoga</i> performed in this manner is factually  one's  own
path of <i>dharma</i> albeit destitute of  merit.  By  another's  <i>dharma</i>  is  meant
<i>jnana yoga</i> or facilitating communion with the Supreme absolute by  knowledge
which depending on  time  and  circumstance  may  or  may  not  be  helpful.
Perfection in <i>jnana  yoga</i>  demands  the  consistent  ability  to  completely
control the mind and conquer the senses which is a  lifetime  endeavour  and
fraught  with  danger  of  lapses  in  constancy.  So  <i>karma  yoga</i>  is  more
fortuitous as the risks are minimal and chances for succeeding  are  greater
even though <i>jnana yoga</i> is on a superior platform. A <i>jiva</i> or  embodied  being
ensconced in a physical body with an appropriate mind and  senses  finds  it
normal to act in accordance with the  natural  impulses  instigated  by  the
senses. This is <i>karma yoga</i> and fulfilling activities in this manner if  they
do not contradict the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures or  disregard  the
prohibitions thereof  incur  no  sin,  for  actions  speak  for  themselves.
Whereas in <i>jnana yoga</i> once control of the mind and  mastery  of  the  senses
has been achieved they must be kept controlled and  mastered  otherwise  one
will fall down from their position and subjected again  to  mundane  desires
and the influence of objects the senses which propels one to sin  and  locks
one in <i>samsara</i> the perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death.  So  by  clearly
elucidating the fact that <i>karma yoga</i>  is  indeed  safer  and  more  sure  of
success,  Lord  Krishna  further  corroborates  what   He   previously   had
promulgated in chapter three.
