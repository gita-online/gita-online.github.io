The renunciates are followers of <i>jnana yoga</i>  or  the  cultivation  of  Vedic
knowledge but the same goal is achieved by  them  upon  realisation  as  the
goal achieved by the followers of <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic  activities
upon realisation. Lord Krishna is stating  that  one  who  comprehends  that
either of the methods leads to the same result is  one  who  is  in  correct
knowledge and such a person has spiritual intelligence.
