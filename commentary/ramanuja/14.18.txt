Now Lord Krishna reveals that those who are situated in <i>sattva guna</i>  or  the
mode of goodness ascend upward  in  spiritual   devlopement  and  eventually
achieve <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence. Those who are  situated
in <i>raja guna</i> or the  mode  of  passion  have  the  desire  for  rewards  for
thecause of  actions engage in activities that give them  the  results  they
wish to exploit and enjoy. Maintaining this mentality they engage  fully  in
such fruitive activities life after life and are born  again  and  again  to
engage  in  more  and  more  works.  Hence  since  it  insures  a   constant
reoccurrence of material  births  it  is  full  of  misery.  Those  who  are
situated in <i>tama guna</i> or the mode of ignorance are engaged  in  degenerative
behaivior and descend downwards  doing  more  and  more  despicable  inhuman
activities. Such beings development is in retrograde and after becoming  the
lowest types of humanity such as cannibals and perverts of beastiality  they
sink into the animal species themselves. After that  due  to  the  reactions
from their heinious activitie they  become worms and maggots and  then  they
even descend into the lowest of plants to  become  stationary  creepers  and
fungus.So Lord Krishna has revealed how the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being rises  in
evolution and how it descends. All those who adopt  and  maintain  a  strict
vegetarian diet as detailed in chapter 6, verse 17 and chapter  17  verse  8
and who perform activities as a matter of duty without impetus  for  rewards
gradually become  fully  situated  in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  and  eventually  ascend
performing all activities for the satifaction for the Supreme Lord.
