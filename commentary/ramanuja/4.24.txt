Here the word <i>brahmarpanam</i> means the paraphernalia used to  offer  oblations
in <i>yagna</i> or offering of worship to propitiate  the  Supreme  Lord.  All  the
accessories used  in  <i>yagna</i>  are  also  considered  to  be  <i>Brahman</i>  or  the
spiritual substratum pervading all existence, along with  the  offerings  of
ghee and grain seeds, the fire they are  offered  through  as  well  as  the
performer of the offering.  Lord Krishna is explaining that everything  used
in <i>yagna</i> can be considered as part of the <i>Brahman</i>.  One  who  realises  that
the <i>Brahman</i> or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence is  actually
abiding in all actions reaches the <i>Brahman</i> which is  becoming  cognisant  of
the spiritual substratum of reality underlying and pervading all  existence.
This is the consciousness of the actions  from  an  aspirant  for  <i>moksa</i>  or
liberation where the <i>atma</i> or soul is understood  to  be  non-different  from
the <i>Brahman.</i> Consequently actions performed in this  consciousness  are  all
known to be spiritual and thus realised is in itself a means  for  achieving
<i>atma tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation  thus  precluding  any  further  need  to
practice <i>jnana yoga</i> or cultivation of Vedic knowledge.
