The word <i>sattvanurupa</i> means according to  the  mental  characteristics.  The
qualities  of  the  mind  saturate  every  <i>jiva</i>  or   embodied   being   and
correspondingly determines the of faith  they  are  endowed  with.  Whatever
state the mind exists in, faith naturally arises from that very state.  This
also implies the desires of the body and the attraction of the  senses.  The
word <i>sraddhamayo</i> means inundated with  one  of  the  three  types  of  faith
situated from either <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness, <i>raja  guna</i>  the  mode
of passion or <i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance. In  whatever  mode  of  faith
one is united with into that mode of faith one is  transformed.  If  such  a
<i>jiva</i> is imbued with faith  for  performing  spiritual  activities  one  will
achieve spiritual results. Contrarily if one  is  attracted  with  faith  to
perform demoniac activities  one  will  achieve  demoniac  results  both  in
accordance with their faith.
