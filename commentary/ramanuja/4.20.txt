Whoever has completely given up all desires and attachments to  rewards  for
actions, who is also <i>nitya-trypto</i> or totally content immersed  in  the  <i>atma</i>
or soul,  whoever  is  self  satisfied  never  depending  on  anything  from
<i>prakriti</i> or material existence. Such a person although seen to  be  intently
performing various prescribed actions, in reality performs inaction  meaning
no action that has any binding effect. Because although  externally  such  a
person might appear as if performing activities but internally  that  person
is actually cultivating spiritual knowledge and meditating on the  <i>atma</i>  and
thus exempt from any  binding  effect.  Lord  Krishna  gives  the  spiritual
intelligence aspect of actions is next.
