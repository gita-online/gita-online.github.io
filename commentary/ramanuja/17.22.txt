Whatever  prescribed  Vedic  activities  performed  by  the  Vaisnavas   and
brahmanas such as study of the Vedic scriptures and  <i>yagna</i>  or  propitiation
and worship by ritual to the Supreme  Lord,  <i>tapah</i>  or  austerities  by  the
<i>ksatriyas</i> or royal warrior class and <i>danam</i> or  charity  by  the  <i>vaisyas</i>  or
merchant class are all done out of devotion and  dedicated  to  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna or  any  of  His  authorised  incarnations  and  expansions  as
revealed in Vedic scriptures  without  the  slightest  desire  for  material
rewards. Such activities  devoid  of  motivation  for  mundane  results  are
designated as  TAT  signifying  that  such  acts  are  for  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the immortal soul, perception of  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence and attaining communion with the  Supreme
Lord. The Vishnu Sahasrasa confirms that:  <i>sah,  vah,  kah,  klim,</i>  and  <i>tat</i>
denote  the  Supreme  absolute.  Hence  the  ontology  of   TAT   has   been
demonstrated  to  signify  its  connection  to  transcendental  and  eternal
activities  which  independently  bestow  <i>moksa</i>  or  freedom  from  material
existence and promotion to the eternal spiritual realms.
