Humans possessing virtue whose sins have dissolved away due to exclusively
performing  righteous actions in words, thoughts and deeds have effectively
terminated sins stemming  from an immemorial past due to the impulses of
dualities in the form of attraction and aversion  which obstructed them
from being spiritually aware and God conscious. The termination of such
sins by virtue of highly meritorious  activities benefiting all creation is
only acquired after many numerous lives. Determined by the various degrees
in quality of merit derived from purely spiritual activities or spiritual
activities mixed with philanthropic activities or philanthropic activities
mixed with self interest activities, etc. humans are given the opportunity
to take shelter of the Supreme Lord on different levels in varying degrees
and sanctioned to be relieved from the beguiling bewitchment of maya or
illusory impressions superimposed upon the mind. Then at that time they
realising Lord Krishna's supreme position they make a firm resolve to
worship Him exclusively seeking either:
<p>
aisvarya arthi or great fortune, opulence and power. Applies to the
atharthi in verse 16.
kaivaly-arthi or self-realisation over death. Applies to the jijnasur in
verse 16 .
moksa-arthi the Supreme Lord Himself as the only goal. Applies to the jnani
in verse 16.
<p>
Enumeration and will now be giefly given regarding the qualifications which
the above stated three categories of the Supreme Lords own votaries have to
acquire along with requisite knowledge they have to cultivate and obtain.
