The word <i>karya</i> meaning effect refers to the physical body. The  word  <i>karana</i>
means the instrument of  action  denoting  the  senses  of  perception,  the
organs of action and the mind. In the activation of both  <i>karya</i>  and  <i>karana</i>
to function the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul alone  is  the  cause.  This  confirms
that all manifest activity by which the <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  experiences
existence is dependent upon <i>prakriti</i> or the  material  substratum  pervading
physical existence which is predicated by the  impulses  of  the  <i>atma.</i>  The
<i>atma</i> merely performs its natural function as monitor  and  director  of  the
<i>jiva</i> in all respects. Affirmation of this is given in  the  following  Vedic
aphorism found in the Vedanta Sutra  II:III.XXXX  beginning  <i>krita  prayatna</i>
<i>apekesah</i> meaning the Supreme Lord induces the <i>atma</i> to act according  to  the
effects experienced by the <i>jiva</i> so that there is  no  contradiction  in  the
prohibitions and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures. The  function  of  the
<i>atma</i> is to witness the <i>karma</i> or reactions to one's actions  and  govern  the
<i>jiva</i> effects of <i>karma</i> as they evolve and grow. The <i>atma</i>  being  embodied  is
the sole cause for a <i>jiva</i> to experience joy and grief through the medium  of
matter. Thus the difference in function in regard to both the <i>atma</i>  and  the
physical body has been briefly elaborated seperately and in conjunction.

The process by which the inherently pure and spiritual <i>atma</i>  which  is  most
blessed comes to experience pleasures and pain  derived  from  contact  with
products of matter is through the  three  <i>gunas</i>  being  modes  of  goodness,
passion and  ignorance  which  are  effects  of  <i>prakriti</i>  and  figuratively
symbolise all derivatives of matter as all matter is within  the  purvey  of
the three gunas. Here in this verse the word  <i>purusa</i>  is  referring  to  His
expansion as the <i>atma</i>  within the heart of all living entities which by  its
own intrinsic nature is liberated and  blissful  but  by  the  influence  of
<i>karma</i> and  <i>prakriti</i>  is  entangled  in  the  material  existence  undergoing
experiences of enjoyment and suffering  based  on  this  relationship  which
manifest according to the dicitates and constraints of   the  adventitiously
and contrary circumstances of past actions from which  arise  effects  known
as <i>karma.</i> The  word  <i>bhoktrtve</i>  meaning  the  experience  of  happiness  and
distress confirms this.
