As this science of immortality is exceeding esoteric and confidential,  Lord
Krishna gives the mandate as  to  those  whom  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  should
never be imparted to.
<i>1) atapaskaya</i> means one who does not exercise control of their senses
<i>2) na abhaktaya</i> means one who is not a devotee of Lord Krishna or any  of
His incarnations and expansions. A deeper interpretation  is  that  it
should never be given to one who has no love for Lord Krishna  or  any
of His incarnation and expansions. Even if one is aspiring to  receive
initiation as a Vaisnava Brahmin; yet  if  one  is  devoid  of  loving
devotion to Lord Krishna then the  confidential  teachings  of  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita should be restricted from them until qualified.
<i>3) susrusave</i> means one  who's  averse  to  submissive  reverence  to  the
spiritual guru
<i>4) abhyasuyati</i> means one who is envious and blasphemous  to  the  Supreme
Lord.
<p>
To these four types of <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings Srimad Bhagavad-Gita  should
never be disclosed. For whatever they would hear  about  the  Supreme  Lords
glories and potencies would make such vile  miscreants  offensive  in  their
attitude and actions.
<p>
The differences of case  employed  in  the  ablative  form  <i>a-tapaskaya,  a-</i>
<i>bhaktaya</i> etc. to the nominative  form  <i>yo  mam</i>  etc.  is  to  emphasise  the
exceedingly despicable characteristics of those who are <i>abhyasuyati</i> who  are
just like poison vipers. The exposure of the wicked is more  imperious  then
the laudation of the virtuous as the wicked are most degraded.
