Lust, greed and anger are  all  situated  deep  in  <i>tama-guna</i>  the  mode  of
ignorance and as such causes the demoniac to be deluded by immense  illusion
regarding  the  factual  reality  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.  Although
difficult to rectify the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being who is able  to  avert  them
can escape  their  control  and  employ  themselves  in  a  manner  that  is
conducive to the development of spiritual consciousness and <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul. Any <i>jiva</i> who achieves actual, factual knowledge  of
Lord Krishna as the creator of all and His absolute  paramount  position  as
the Supreme Lord of all existence will naturally develop reverence for  Him.
This results  in  a  harmonious  spirit  attuned  with  the  divine  nature,
cooperation with His devotees and  the  utmost  respect  for  all  life  and
creation. From this point of consciousness one will attain association  with
Lord Krishna's  devotees  and  by  their  mercy  proceed  to  attaining  the
sublime, ultimate goal under their guidance. That disregard  and  disrespect
for the ordinances and injunctions of  the  Vedic  scriptures  is  the  main
reason why a <i>jiva</i> will be forced to go  and  suffer  in  hell  is  explained
next.
