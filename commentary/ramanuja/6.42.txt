The genitive case of the word <i>yoginam</i> has the force  of  the  ablative  case
<i>yogibhyah i</i>which means of  all  types  of  <i>yogis</i>  or  those  perfecting  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness. Thus <i>yoginam</i> means more than just being a  <i>yogi,</i>  it
means being a special <i>yogi</i> above  and  beyond  and  superior  to  all  other
<i>yogi's</i> including the four <i>yogi's</i> described in  verse  twenty-nine  beginning
with <i>sarva-bhuta-stham atmanam</i> which refers to the <i>yogi</i>  who  perceives  the
soul in all beings. Verse thirty beginning  with  <i>yo  mam  pasyati  sarvatra</i>
which refers to the <i>yogi</i> who sees the  Supreme  Lord  in  everything.  Verse
thirty-one beginning with <i>sarva-bhuta-sthitam</i> which refers to the  <i>yogi</i>  who
realises the Supreme Lord as non-different from  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul.  Verse
thirty-two beginning with <i>atmaupamyena sarvatra</i> which  refers  to  the  <i>yogi</i>
who  perceives  the  <i>atma</i>  as   all   pervading   consciousness   activating
everything. As the <i>yogi indicated</i> in this verse does not fall  into  one  of
the four mentioned classifications the  genitive  case  does  not  have  the
power to place this <i>yogi</i> into one of those classes. The words  <i>api  sarvesam</i>
meaning amongst all types refers to  those  additional  <i>yogis</i>  indicated  in
this verse which follow the <i>yoga</i> paths of  <i>karma,  jnana,  tapasya,  astanga</i>
etc. Likewise also the genitive case of the word  <i>sarvesam</i>  meaning  of  all
types, has the force of the ablative case which indicates this special  <i>yogi</i>
is a <i>bhakta</i> or loving devotee of the Supreme Lord and thus greater than  all
other <i>yogis.</i> In comparison with this special <i>yogi</i>  all  other  <i>yogi's</i>  being
inferior can be grouped into a single class.  The  comparison  between  that
special <i>yogi</i>  and  the  single  class  of  all  the  other  <i>yogi's</i>  is  like
designating the special <i>yogi</i> as the Himmalaya's and all other  <i>yogi's</i>  as  a
handful  of  mustard  seeds.  Between  one  seed  and  another  upon   close
introspection differences  certainly exist;  but  such  differences  between
seeds cannot be compared  to  the  difference  between  the  seeds  and  the
Himmalaya's. In the word <i>atmana</i> is  the  word  <i>manas</i>  meaning  giving  one's
heart, mind, body and soul  in  devotion  over  flowing  with  love  to  the
Supreme  Lord.  This  dedication  is   extraordinary   and   glorifies   and
distinguishes one from out of all other <i>yogi's.</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Antar-atmana equates to the innermost <i>manas</i> being the  <i>atma</i>  which  monitors
all internal and external experiences. So over powered by love of God   this
special <i>yogi</i> is unable to even  maintain  his  very  existence  without  the
assistance of the Supreme Lord. In this way he is always one with Him.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>Sraddhavan</i> means with earnestness and faith in the Vedic  scriptures  taught
by the spiritual master. The earnestness of desire to  worship  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna comes from an intrinsic impulse which impels this special  <i>yogi</i>
to find Him. The intensity of yearning love that this special <i>yogi</i>  has  for
the Supreme Lord is such that one is  unable  to  tolerate  even  a  moments
separation from Him.
<p>
<p>
<p>
The Supreme Lord to whom the emanations,  sustenations  and  immanations  of
the cosmos abounding in unlimited, diverse variegated objects of  enjoyments
and enjoyers through the medium of the physical body and the senses  is  but
creative sport.
<p>
The  Supreme  Lord  the  treasure  chest  of  myriad  groups   of   glorious
attributes, who possesses all <i>jnana</i> or knowledge meaning  cognition  in  all
things in every respect every moment, all <i>bala</i> or  power  meaning  supports,
maintains and controls everything, all <i>aisvarya</i> or  dominion  means  unaided
and undaunted the most powerful, all <i>tejas</i> or luster means  self  manifested
effulgence, all <i>virya</i> or energy means never exhausted or ending, all  <i>saktis</i>
or potencies means phenomenal miracles and pastime and on an on,  etc.  etc.
etc.
<p>
The Supreme Lord whose Divine <i>rupa</i> or form  is  a  synthesis  of  everything
which is glorious  and  beautiful.  Who  is  inconceivable,  transcendental,
eternal, imperishable, phenomenal, possessing phenomenal qualities  such  as
<i>aujjvalya</i> or full radiance,  <i>sundarya</i>  or  full  beauty,   <i>gandhya</i>  or  full
fragrance, <i>lavanya</i> or full grace and <i>yauvana</i> or full youth and  who  is  the
antithesis to all that is evil.
<p>
The Supreme Lord's essence, qualities and attributes are beyond the ability
of the mind to conceive in vision and extol in speech.
<p>
The Supreme Lord is the unlimited, majestic and resplendent ocean of
compassion, magnanimity, mercy and love.
<p>
The Supreme Lord is the sole saviour and refuge of all the worlds, who
mitigates and  relieves the oppression of  distress for those who make
supplication to Him, who is the only object of total love from His
devotees, who can become theophanous and ocularly visible to all persons.
<p>
The Supreme Lord who appeared incarnate in the material existence in His
own original divine and spiritual form, who illuminates all of creation by
the infinitely sublime glory of His bodily effulgence, who maintains and
preserves all of creation and fills all with gladness by the resplendent
glory of His Divine self.
<p>
Whosoever meditates on the Supreme Lord Krishna in this manner He keeps
most near to Him as they are most dear to Him and are the most estimable
and elevated above all others.
<p>
Because the Supreme Lord Krishna is eternally omniscient, omnipresent and
omnipotent knowing past, present and future what He speak is always the
absolute truth for all eternity.
