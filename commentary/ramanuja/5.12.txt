Discerning in the mind that all authorship of any action resides within  the
physical body and is  the  cause  by  which  the  <i>atma</i>  or  soul  within  is
compromised due  to  the  reactions  from  past  life  activities.  One  can
distinguish that authorship of actions are not  an  essential  attribute  of
the <i>atma</i> and thus  the  embodied  <i>atma</i>  shall  assign  all  actions  to  the
authority of the physical body. Then  remaining  content,  independent  from
the body one performs no action  as  a  consequence  of  being  a  passenger
residing within the body ceases to cause the body to act.  The  exact,  true
nature of the independent <i>atma</i> Lord Krishna reveals next.
