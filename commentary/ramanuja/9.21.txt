The compound word <i>trai-vidya</i> denotes the lower spiritual sciences  known  as
<i>karma kanda</i> or actions for fruitive  rewards  also  enjoined  in  the  three
Vedas. Persons who perform worship for rewards are known as  <i>trai-vidya</i>  and
are not devotees of the  Supreme  Lord  as  they  have  desires  other  than
devotion to Lord Krishna or  His  authorised  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and
expansions and so they revolve perpetually in <i>samsara</i> the endless  cycle  of
birth and death. The devotees of Lord Krishna  who  understand  Him  as  the
goal to be known and the highest attainment are  indeed  the  <i>mahatmanas</i>  or
great beings and as stated in verse 14 they  inspiringly  sing  His  glories
and as stated in verse 15 they enthusiastically  learn  and  enlighten  each
other about all aspects of His  divine  glory  intensely   focusing  on  Him
exclusively in remembrance and meditation as their  sole  ambition  in  life
and the acme of their ambition. To  the  contrary  those  votaries  who  are
addicted to studying the three Vedas for fruitive rewards are known as <i>trai-</i>
<i>vidya</i> and they desire <i>Svargaloka</i> the heavenly planets where there is no  old
age and disease and everyone may partake of  <i>Soma</i>  or  the  heavenly  nectar
after offering it to the  demigods  and  lesser  divinities,  such  votaries
enjoy in full energy and bliss as prescribed in the Rig Veda, Sama Veda  and
Yajus Veda where the Atharva Veda was extracted.  The  ordinary  sins  which
obstruct the passage of  a  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied  being  from  this  world  to
<i>Svargaloka</i> are thus dissolved by the worship  and  adoration  of  Indra  the
heavenly chief and entering the heavenly spheres they reap their rewards  of
exquisite heavenly delights never realising that  it  is  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna alone who sanctions those rewards  and  that  Indra  is  merely  His
representative. Thus those of fruitive desires  abandon  themselves  to  the
full pursuit of delectable pleasures fully accessible in  the  vast  regions
of <i>Svargaloka.</i> But after a long duration of  time,  once  their  accumulated
merit has been exhausted and the time allotment for their  heavenly  sojourn
has expired they again fall back into material existence of <i>samsara.</i>

Thus those who hanker after material  delights  following  the  <i>karma  kanda</i>
sections of the Vedas, ignoring the superior spiritual  knowledge  found  in
the Vedas as well revolve up and down, back and  forth  obtaining  lives  of
elevations and recessions. The word <i>gatim</i> denoting  destination  comes  from
the words <i>gat - agatam</i>  meaning transitory states with  no  permanence  this
infers that the enjoyments of <i>Swargaloka</i> are  of  a  trivial  and  temporary
nature involving  a  revocation  and  termination.  Whereas  the  <i>mahatmanas</i>
hanker only for the Supreme Lord, giving themselves completely in <i>bhakti</i>  or
ardent loving devotion to Him  and thus they assuredly achieve  the  eternal
spiritual worlds never returning and attain the Supreme Lord Krishna who  is
immeasurable, inexpressible and inconceivable <i>annada</i> or  bliss  personified.
Additional characteristics distinguishing the <i>mahatmanas</i> is given next.
