This confirms that Lord Krishna is the generating cause and  origin  of  the
all the wonderfully, marvellous and  fascinatingly  phenomenal  displays  of
activity found abounding in all creation comprised of intelligent  and  non-
intelligent beings and objects. He  alone  energises  all  of  creation  and
manifests  the  impulses  required  for   all   actions.   The   spiritually
intelligent are the <i>mahatmanas</i> or great  illuminated  beings  who  <i>matva</i>  or
realise His Supreme Absolute position  as the  ultimate  controller  of  all
existence. Who possesses all  illustrious  attributes  such  as  compassion,
affection, reciprocity, friendship,  etc.  These  great  beings  are  <i>bhava-</i>
<i>samanvitah</i> or endowed with a  wonderful  way  of  serving  Lord  Krishna  in
<i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion according to their  internal  mood.  The
spiritually intelligent cultivate their minds in such a way  as  to  acquire
this mood and deeply immerse themselves in  it.  How  this  is  accomplished
Lord Krishna reveals next.
