Whatever there is in existence that  is  wonderful,  glorious,  majestic  or
magnificent. Wherever is seen in  existence  fantastic  enthusiasm  attended
too with great pomp and eclat. Whoever and however  there  is  in  existence
that manifests and broadcasts the phenomenal grandeur and sublime  glory  of
the Supreme  Lord  should  be  known  to  be  under  His  direction  and  an
infinitesimal portion of the <i>tejas</i> or power of  Lord  Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
divine, transcendental opulence. Out of His inconceivable  potency  all  His
<i>vibhuti</i> manifest from but a fraction of His power.
