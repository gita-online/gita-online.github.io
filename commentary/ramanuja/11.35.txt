The word <i>ananta</i> means infinite and the word  <i>nivasa</i>  means  foundation.  The
word <i>aksaram</i> means imperishable and refers  to  Lord  Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
divine transcendental opulence known as <i>brahman</i> or the spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence.  It  also  denoted  the  category  of  <i>jivatmas</i>  or
individual souls as embodied beings  which  are  imperishable  as  well  and
confirmed in the Katha  Upanisad  I.II.XVIII  beginning  <i>najayate  mriyateva</i>
<i>vipaschit</i> meaning: The soul  is  eternal  and  is  neither  born  nor  dies.
Referring  to  <i>prakriti</i>  or  the  material  substratum  pervading   physical
existence Lord Krishna is <i>sat</i> the effect and <i>asat</i> or the cause.  <i>Sat</i>  is  in
reference to physical existence in its manifested,  variegated  state  which
is the effect. <i>Asat</i> is in  reference  to  the  latent  non-variegated  state
which is indiscernible and is the cause.  The  effect  manifests  as  names,
forms, attributes and qualities being distinguishable.  The  cause  is  when
all the manes, forms, attributes and qualities are  imperceptible.  What  is
beyond that is <i>tat param</i> or superior and refers to the <i>multi-atmas</i>  who  are
beyond the categories of  <i>jivatma</i>  or  bound  souls  and  <i>prakriti</i>  or  dull
matter. Arjuna is beyond these two categories as well  being  a  surrendered
devotee of Lord Krishna, As the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul is the  conscious  life
force of the physical body; the Supreme Lord Krishna is the  conscious  life
force of all creation.
