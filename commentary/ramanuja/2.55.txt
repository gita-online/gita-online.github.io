To be free from an agitated mind is not to become aggrieved when  situations
arise of impending affliction and difficulty or  bereavement  for  something
cherished and lost. To not be  elated  in  happiness  is  to  remain  in  an
unattached and passive state even when joyous events occur.  Desire  is  the
longing for things not obtained. One must learn to be free from  this.  Fear
is worrying for prospective sorrow which may be  caused  by  bereavement  of
what is cherished and the projection of the coming of unwanted  things.  One
must learn to be free from this. Anger is that disturbed state of  mind  and
irritated feelings produced of pain  from  others  causing  separation  from
what is cherished or giving the experience  of  things  not  cherished.  One
must learn to be free from this. Such a being is a <i>muni</i> or one  of  profound
contemplation on the soul. This being is known as <i>sthita-prajna</i> situated  in
perfect knowledge of transcendental consciousness.  Lord  Krishna  describes
the next lower stage in the next verse.
