Due to the accumulation of unlimited sins by ignoring the ordinances of  the
Vedic scriptures, ignorant fools mistake the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  to  be
perishable like any  other  member  of  humanity.  Such  fools  are  totally
incognisant to the reality that Lord  Krishna  is  the  Supreme  omniscient,
omnipresent and omnipotent Lord of all creation and that  He  manifests  His
original form that appears to be like all of  humanity  due  to  magnanimous
feelings of infinite compassion in order for all living entities to be  able
to have access to Him. Oblivious to Lord Krishna's eternal,  transcendental,
immutable and supreme nature disguised in human form as  a  way  to  display
His phenomenal <i>lilas</i> or divine pastimes by which to inspire and delight  all
of humanity as an act of unlimited mercy and love for all. Yet although  all
over the Earth the name of Lord Krishna and His <i>avatars</i>  or  expansions  and
incarnations has been heard of by all, still  the  ignorant  and  irrational
even after hearing of Him foolishly disregard and disrespect Him  as  if  He
were just an ordinary mortal being.
