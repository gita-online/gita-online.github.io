Lord Krishna reveals that of the letters of  the  alphabet  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
divine, transcendental opulence is the Sanskrit letter A-kara which  is  the
root of all other letters.  The  Rig  Veda,   III.II.III  in  the  Aitareya-
Aranyaka section beginning <i>akaro vai sarva-vak</i>  states  that  the  letter  A
itself contains all  speech.  An  example  of  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  of  <i>dvandva</i>  or
compound words are Rama-Krishna. <i>Samasikasya</i> is the class of  compound  word
forming in Sanskrit. Of the several ways to compound  Lord  Krishna  is  the
dual compound of which both terms  are  substanative   attributes  of  equal
position with each other grammatically. His <i>vibhuti</i>  is  also  expressed  as
ever flowing  time  composed  of  uninterupted  divisions  such  as  <i>kala</i>  a
measurement of 8 seconds and <i>muhurta</i> a period  comprising  1/60th  of  a  24
hour day. Among secondary creators His <i>vibhuti</i> is the four  headed  <i>dhataham</i>
known as Brahma.
