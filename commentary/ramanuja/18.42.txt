The natural duties allocated to  the  <i>vaisyas</i>  or  agricultural,  mercantile
class are:
<i>1) krishi</i> or farming.
<i>2) go-raksa</i> or cow raising and cow protecting
<i>3) vanijyam</i>  or  acts  of  commerce  and  trade  endorsed  by  the  Vedic
scriptures.
The natural duties of <i>sudras</i> or worker class are  amenable  service  to  the
upper 3 classes.
<p>
Thus by defining the duties  of  the  four  classes  in  Vedic  culture  the
necessary performance of prescribed Vedic  activities  and  the  appropriate
participation of each of the four classes is implied. For example  in  <i>yagna</i>
or ritualistic performance of propitiation and  worship  the  <i>Brahmins</i>  will
perform the ceremony, the <i>ksatriya</i> will  donate  wealth,  the  <i>vaisyas</i>  will
supply the ingredients such as <i>ghee</i> or clarified butter  and  cow  products,
the <i>sudras</i> will serve the <i>ksatriyas</i> and <i>vaisyas.</i>
<p>
The Brahmins being naturally endowed with <i>sattva guna</i> the mode  of  goodness
are allotted with <i>samah</i> or self  control  of  the  mind  which  bestows  the
purity required to perform Vedic rituals and ceremonies. Although  qualified
for initiation this was not allocated to <i>ksatriya</i> and <i>vaisyas</i>  due  to  they
having a preponderance of <i>raja guna</i> mode of passion and <i>tama  guna</i>  mode  of
ignorance which is not compatible with <i>samah.</i> 
<p>
The Brahmins exemplify by example the  teachings  of  the  Vedic  scriptures
instructing others the proper way to live a  human  existence  according  to
the status of life they are   in.  The  <i>ksatriyas</i>  duty  is  to  righteously
govern and protect the citizens of the country.  The  <i>vaisyas</i>  duty  is  cow
protection and cultivating food for the population. The <i>sudras</i>  duty  is  to
do all the menial services for a fair compensation, necessary for the  upper
three classes to discharge their duties expediently and efficiently.
