<i>Karma yoga</i> or prescribed Vedic activities is the explained by  Lord  Krishna
as  the  means  for  ascending  in   spiritual   knowledge   and   achieving
renunciation in their quest for <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul.  But
once a person has actually achieved renunciation and  is  securely  situated
then the cessation of activities is the rule and  meditation,  introspection
and reflection becomes the means for attaining  <i>atma  tattva.</i>  Exactly  when
one is considered to be well established and  securely  situated  in  <i>dhyana</i>
<i>yoga</i> or the science of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion
with the ultimate consciousness by meditation is next.
