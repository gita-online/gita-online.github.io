The natures of the fiendish <i>asura's</i>  or  the  not  divine  and  the  hellish
<i>raksasas</i> or the demoniac is very inveigling and  shuts  out  from  view  the
superior nature and qualities of infinite  mercy  and  compassion  that  are
concealed under Lord Krishna's anthropomorphic exterior which appears  human
and this they espouse thinking He is also perishable. Such  thinking  causes
them to become: <i>moghasa</i> of vain appetites having desires  that  will  remain
unfulfilled, <i>mogha-karmano</i> pursuing vain endeavours, <i>mogha-jnana</i>  possessing
vain knowledge  that  has  no  value  inasmuch  as  it  is  based  on  false
conceptions of Lord Krishna  on  the  fundamental  level  and  <i>vicetasah</i>  or
mentally fractured and confused about the Supreme  Lord.  By  accepting  the
Supreme Lord of all to resemble and  be  equated  with  any  other  ordinary
human, by such mentality whatever effort  and  endeavour  is  embarked  upon
with any goal in view shall all be done in vain for such actions  will  reap
no fruition.
