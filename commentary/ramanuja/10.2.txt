The myriad hosts of demigods totally 330  million  in  charge  of  universal
management throughout all creation and even the great  liberated  sages  who
are highly illuminated and capable of super subtle perception knowing  past,
present and future are both not incognizant of the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna's
<i>prabhavam</i> which is His supreme, sublime divine appearance. This  means  that
they are not aware of the transcendental nature of His  <i>rupa</i>  or  form,  His
<i>guna</i> or attributes, His <i>lilas</i> or pastimes, and His <i>dhama</i> or abode. In  every
way Lord Krishna is the cause and the source of  the  essence,  intelligence
and power possessed by all gods, demigods and sages.  Whatever  intelligence
and power they have is limited corresponding to the measure  of  entitlement
warranted and which is awarded solely  by  the  Supreme  Lord  according  to
their merits. This is what makes them have their  position  and  makes  them
demigods  and  great  sages.  Their  consciousness  being  limited   it   is
impossible for them to fathom Lord  Krishna  divine,  transcendental  nature
which is inconceivable to comprehend with the mind. Yet now  such  knowledge
although inconceivable will be revealed by Lord Krishna  which  will  remove
the irascible impediments and obnoxious obstacles that detrimentally  impede
<i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion to the Supreme Lord from germinating and growing.
