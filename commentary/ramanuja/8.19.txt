Those  who  understand  the  succession  of  Brahma's  day  and   night   as
established by the Supreme Lord Krishna applicable for  all  created  beings
from human up to the highest  material  being  know  that  the  duration  of
Brahma's day is 4 billion 320 million years and an  equal  duration  is  his
night. At the  dawning  of  Brahma's  day  all  beings  and  things  in  the
threefold regions of material existence along with their bodies and  senses,
objects of enjoyment and locations of enjoyment all in a subtle  form  issue
out of an <i>avyakta</i> or unmanifest state emanting Brahma's  subtle  body.  When
Brahma's night draws nigh all that issued out are all once again  reabsorbed
into that <i>avyakta</i> state of his  subtle  body.  The  exact  same  groups  and
species of variegated beings adhere to the stringent law  of  <i>karma</i>  or  the
reactions to previous actions are bound in the material existence  and  come
and go. Appearing in Brahma's day and  vanishing  in  his  night  again  and
again perpetually.
<p>
One year of Brahma equals 26 trillion, 438 billion and  400  million  years.
When the duration of Brahma's life which is 100 of  such  years  ends.  Then
immeadiately all systems of all material worlds in existence,  operating  in
tandem or at random up to Brahma's own planet and even  Brahma  himself  are
ended and dissolve into the infinite.  This  dissolution  has  an  order  as
confirmed in the Subala Upanisad beginning: <i>Prithivy  apsu  praliyate,  apas</i>
<i>tejas liyante</i> meaning Earth is devolved into water, water is  devolved  into
fire. Fire is devolved into air etc. air is devolved into  ether,  ether  is
devolved into the cosmos, the cosmos devolves into <i>avyakta</i>  the  unmanifest,
the unmanifest devolves into the <i>aksara</i> the imperishable,  the  imperishable
devolves into <i>tamas</i> or darkness and the darkness merges  finally  back  into
the Supreme Being. Thus all things except the  Supreme  Lord  are  regulated
and controlled by time. All things without exception owe their existence  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna, deriving their inception from Him  and  concluding
their absorption in Him. In the  material  worlds  there  is  absolutely  no
alternative to the cycle of birth and death. Thus at the  end  of  life  the
forced relinquishing of material wealth and opulence for  those  who  wasted
there lives to obtain it is inevitable.  But  for  those  who  instead  used
their precious human life to attain the Supreme Lord Krishna, having Him  as
there sole refuge and goal; for them rebirth is not even  to  be  considered
as they are automatically liberated from  <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual  cycle  of
birth and death. Next will be shown that there is also no rebirth for  those
who have achieved <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul.
