The word <i>manavah</i> means men. It is derived from Manu the father  of  mankind,
who wrote the Manu Samhita which are the  guidelines  for  the  human  race.
Thus all  mankind  as  the  descendants  of  Manu  are  followers  of  Vedic
scriptures. The great personalities like Manu contemplating  and  reflecting
on the Vedas determine what is the  main  import  of  the  Vedas,  which  is
precisely the formulised will of the Lord  act  accordingly  to  this  inner
directive.
<p>
There  are  persons  who  although  unable  to   practice   the   prescribed
injunctions enjoined in the Vedic scriptures still have  faith  and  believe
in the tenets inculcated therein.  There are others who although  not  fully
understanding and believing still do not doubt the  veracity  and  authority
of the Vedic scriptures.
<p>
All these three classes of mankind shall be redeemed and delivered from  the
vast aggregate of past sins accumulated since  time  immemorial  that  keeps
one locked in bondage to the  material  existence.  Lord  Krishna  uses  the
words <i>te api</i> meaning they also to emphasise that these even those not  fully
believing if they  remain  passive  and  do  not  blaspheme  they  are  also
entitled to absolution from past sins which is  the  cause  of  bondage  and
gradually attain <i>moksa</i> or deliverance from the cycle of birth and death.
<p>
The next verse tells the fate of the blasphemers and non-observers  of  this
edict.
