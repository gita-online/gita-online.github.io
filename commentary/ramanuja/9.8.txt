The Supreme Lord Krishna  has  perpetual  recourse  to  His  own  marvellous
modifiable   external energy known as <i>prakriti</i> or  the  material  substratum
pervading all physical and subtle existence and differentiate  it  in  eight
fold ways. He repeatedly creates with regularity the fourfold  divisions  of
created living entities being  demigods,  humans,  animal  and  plants  from
their dormant inactive state,  powerless  under  the  control  of  <i>prakritis</i>
alluring and bewildering <i>gunas</i> of passion, ignorance and  goodness.  Yet  it
may  be  thought  that  such  creative   acts   involving   imbalances   and
inequalities can cause reactions to come to the Supreme Lord Himself due  to
the result of having manifested a creation  full  of  seemingly  differences
and contradictions. The reply to this query is clearly resolved in the  next
verse.
