The words <i>raja-vidya</i> mean kingly knowledge, supreme wisdom. As the  king  is
the most supreme ruler this knowledge is the most supreme wisdom. The  words
<i>raja-guhyam</i> mean the supreme secret or most  confidential.  True  kings  are
those who possess lofty minds and deep hearts. So this supreme knowledge  is
appropriate for those  also  having  such  minds  and  hearts.  Only  people
possessing lofty minds and deep hearts possess the  discrimination  to  know
what must be kept sacred and  confidential  from  the  mundane  and  profane
view. To such persons this knowledge is a sacred mystery  and  revered.  The
word <i>pavitram</i> means pure, sanctifying, having  the  virtue  to  absolve  all
impurities which obstruct the attainment of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna.  The
word <i>pratyasavagamam</i> means realisation by  direct  perception.  <i>Avagamam</i>  is
that which is realised and therefore an  object  of  perception.  Hence  the
reality which  becomes  perceived  is  in  fact  consciousness  and  becomes
<i>pratyasavagamam.</i>
<p>
The purport of this is that by performing <i>bhakti</i> or pure, loving  devotional
service unto the Supreme Lord, He immediately reveals Himself internally  to
His surrendered devotee. The word  <i>dharmyam</i>  meaning  eternal  righteousness
has the virtueof being  inseparable from the Supreme Lord. The attribute  of
<i>dharmyam</i> is known to be the means to achieve spiritual  communion  with  the
Supreme Lord.
<p>
In and of itself the very nature  of  virtue  is  happiness.  But  when  the
practice of virtue is known to be capable of granting direct access  to  the
Supreme  Lord  it  becomes  extremely  exhilarating  and  is  so  joyful  to
cultivate as it leads one to the exquisitely blissful goal of attaining  the
Supreme Lord Krishna. Thus it is <i>susukham kartum</i> or very joyful to  perform.
This supreme wisdom being so delightful and congenial is what  Lord  Krishna
is about to reveal and must always be embraced with faith in  gratitude  and
love. The word <i>avyayam</i> means imperishable. This means that <i>bhakti</i>  or  pure,
loving devotion does not  cease  when  one  attains  the  Supreme  Lord  but
continues expanding, unabated eternally.
<p>
What Lord Krishna is declaring is that  when  His  loving  devotee  achieves
this quality of devotion  then  He  immediately  delivers  Himself  to  them
entirely, feeling that it  is  insufficient   compensation  by  what  He  is
giving to His <i>bhakta</i> or devotee who has so much love for Him.  Lord  Krishna
feels that even after He has given Himself  entirely  to  His  devotee  that
still this is not enough compensation to  reciprocate  for  their  love  for
Him. This is how inconceivably profoundly Lord Krishna regards  His  beloved
devotees.
