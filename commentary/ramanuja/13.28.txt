Another analogy is utilized by Lord Krishna  in  how  the  sun  is  able  to
solely illuminate the entire universe.  In the same way  does  <i>paramatma</i>  or
the Supreme Soul illuminate all the <i>atmas</i> or immortal souls in creation  and
then each individual <i>atma</i> illuminates with consciousness the  tabernacle  of
the physical body of every <i>jiva</i> or embodied being in which  it  inhabits  in
that lifetime. This consciousness exists completely throughout the  physical
body surrounding it as well to some degree and definitively thinks that  the
physical body is its <i>ksetra</i> or field of activity. It  should  be  understood
that just as the sun in  its  capacity  of  illumination  differs  from  the
universe it illuminates. In the  same  way  it  should  be  understood  that
<i>paramatma</i> is supremely different from all individual <i>atmas</i>  even  though  it
illuminates them all with consciousness and in the same manner it should  be
understood that the localized <i>atma</i> is uniquely different from its <i>ksetra</i>  of
the body.
