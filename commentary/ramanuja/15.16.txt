Now Lord Krishna expounds upon the supreme soul  which  is  transcendent  to
both <i>ksarah</i> or fallible and the <i>aksarah</i> or infallible  respectively  as  the
conditioned  and  the  liberated.  This  supreme  soul  is   designated   as
<i>paramatma</i> in all the Vedic scriptures. The very epithet  of  <i>parama</i>  meaning
exaltedly supreme reveals that <i>paramatma</i> is distinctly unique and  different
from even the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul. All the <i>atmas</i> collectively  in  all  of
creation comprise the spiritual  form  of  <i>paramatma</i>  which  penetrates  all
creation sustaining and maintaining  it.  The  word  <i>loka</i>  means  world  and
because it is written as <i>lokyate</i> it refers to the three  classifications  of
worlds. One of them  is  <i>achetana</i>  the  inanimate  worlds.  Two  is  <i>buddha-</i>
<i>chetana</i>  or the animate worlds mixed with the  inanimate  worlds.  Three  is
the unlimited and eternally liberated spiritual worlds. It  is  these  three
categories of worlds and all the <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings  upon  them  that
the Supreme Lord Krishna pervades and permeates, maintains and  sustains  by
the fact that all the  worlds  are  originally  generated  by  Him.  As  the
soveriegn creator of all creation this makes Him distinctly  different  from
everything else yet at the same time a part  of  it.  Because  He  alone  is
infinite it can be comprehended that only He  can  be  distinctly  different
from the finite consisting of the  inanimate,  the  animate,  the  <i>jivas</i>  in
bondage and those who have achieved liberation.
