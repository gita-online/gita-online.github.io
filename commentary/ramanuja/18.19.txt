In <i>varna-asrama</i> or the  divisions  of  society  the  <i>Brahmins</i>  comprise  the
spiritual heiarchy, the <i>ksatriyas</i> the royal and warrior class,  the  <i>vaisyas</i>
the farmer and mercantile class and the <i>sudra</i> the worker class  serving  the
previous three. The other four divisions are <i>brahmacari</i> or celibate  student
life, <i>grihasta</i> or married householder life, <i>vanaprastha</i> or  separation  from
wife and family and <i>sannyasa</i>  or  complete  renunciation  from  society  and
exclusive devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna  or  any  of  His  authorised
incarnations as revealed in Vedic scriptures. There  are  all  variances  in
appearance within these eight divisions such as  tall,  strong,  attractive,
delicate, etc. Yet one who sees the one undivided, spiritual reality of  the
<i>atma</i> or immortal souls existing equally within all <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings
and  perceives  that  they  are  all  inconceivably   indivisible   although
manifesting  individually  sharing  collectively  in  eternality  is  firmly
situated in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness.  One  who  sees  the  <i>atma</i>  as
indestructible and  unchangeable  within  the  destructible  and  changeable
physical body and who although performing variegated  prescribed  activities
in any capacity has comprehended that they are not the actual doer and  also
have no interest in the rewards of actions is situated in <i>sattva guna.</i>
