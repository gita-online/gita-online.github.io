Lord Krishna reveals that of <i>damayatam</i> or chastisers His <i>vibhuti</i> or  divine,
transcendental opulence is the rod of punishment  that  punishes  those  who
are infringement of the law. Of those who seek to succeed  in  conflict  His
<i>vibhuti</i> is the expedient policy of reconciliation, dissension,  bribery  and
dominance. Of all matters  concerning  secrecy  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  is  <i>maunam</i>  or
silence.
