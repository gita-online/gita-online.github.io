Exclusively dedicated to the <i>atma</i> or soul the <i>yogi</i>  or  one  perfecting  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness by <i>dhyana</i> or meditation  is  relieved  from  all  the
vast, past accumulation of sins and receives  infinite  bliss  arising  from
directly experiencing contact with the <i>atma.</i> Lord Krishna speaks  the  words
<i>brahma-samsparsam</i> which means communion with <i>paramatma</i> the supreme soul  and
ultimate consciousness, by this one  becomes  liberated  from  the  material
existence. The words <i>atyantam</i>  means  endless,  <i>sukham</i>   means  ecstasy  and
<i>asnute</i>  means  easily.   The  <i>yogi</i>  who  gives  constant  attention  to  the
transcendental inner nature reachs perfection easily. Next the  four  levels
of mature meditation will be described in the following four verses.
