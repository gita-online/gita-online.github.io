In the Supreme Lord Krishna's <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal  form  could  be
seen all species of life. Those manifesting  from  wombs,  from  eggs,  from
seeds and from fermentation. The four faced Brahma  seated  upon  the  lotus
flower emanating from the navel of Garbodaksayi Vishnu was seen  along  with
Shiva sitting upon his lap and all the demigods can  be  seen  on  different
parts of his body. Also great sages and rishis can be seen as well.
