The demoniac completely controlled by <i>maya</i>  the  imperceptible  bewilderment
of  illusion  delude  themselves  by  thinking  that  they  are  capable  of
accomplishing anything merely by their own brains and  might.  The  demoniac
think they are independent and not dependent upon any Supreme Being even  if
it does  at  all  exist.  In  this  way  they  are  full  of  anxiety  which
tempestuously buffets them about by foolish, greedy thoughts  such  as  this
is mine, that to will soon be mine, I want this, I want that, this  I  shall
do and that I  will also do, etc., etc. In this way by their very own  minds
they are caught in the web of illusion and pursuing  their  lust  for  sense
gratification they are totally bereft  of  sound  judgement,  discrimination
and moral conduct.  Lord  Krishna  confirms  that  beyond  material  nature,
unseen and unperceived, death is waiting very  patiently  for  the  allotted
time to snatch them away from all they covet and force them to suffer  their
<i>karma</i> or reactions to their unrighteous sinful actions  in  the  darkest  of
hells.
