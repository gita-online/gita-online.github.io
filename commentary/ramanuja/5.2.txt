The word <i>sannyasa</i> means renunciation denoting renunciation  of  the  rewards
of actions as well and therefore refers to <i>jnana yoga</i> or the cultivation  of
Vedic knowledge. Both <i>jnana yoga</i> and <i>karma yoga</i>  or  performing  prescribed
Vedic activities are competent to award <i>atma tattva;</i>  but  between  the  two
<i>karma yoga</i> is the easier to perform  and  can  in  fact  be  performed  with
renunciation receiving benefits from both. This is Lord Krishna's meaning.
