The <i>purusah</i> or the manifestation of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  transcends
both the body and the mind dwelling within all sentient beings as  <i>paramatma</i>
the Supreme Soul and is <i>upadrasta</i> or the impartial witness who by  means  of
the will  directs  the  operations  pertaining  to  the  physical  body  and
<i>anumanta</i> or sanctions the activities performed  by  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings that lead to  joy  and  grief  in  pursuing  activities  in  material
existence. Thus by virtue of ruling, supporting and guiding  the  <i>jivas</i>  the
<i>purusah</i> is the <i>Mahesvarah</i> the Supreme controller of the physical  body,  the
senses and the mind of all <i>jivas</i>. The conjunctive particle <i>api</i> meaning  also
refers to the epithet of great lord which denotes that as far  as  the  body
is concerned it applies to <i>paramatma</i>  as  well.  The  phrase  <i>purusah  parah</i>
means that the Supreme Being  as  <i>paramatma</i>  is  to  be  differentiated  and
separate due to its unlimited omnipresence within all <i>jivas</i>, from  the  <i>atma</i>
or individual soul which is localised within each <i>jiva.</i>  Although  both  are
immortal and possess the omniscient propensities of infinite cognizance  and
divine consciousness.
