Now Lord Krishna explains the other  <i>padam</i>  or  state  which  is  for  those
aspirants who wish for <i>atma-tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  soul  and  the
secure and permanent  destination  of  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation  from  material
existence. This state  is  <i>aksaram</i>  or  imperishable.  In  the  Brihadaranya
Upanisad V.VIII.VIII beginning <i>sahovacha-itad vai  tad</i>  explains  that  this
state is not material. It is that which the ascetics of the  worlds  attempt
to gain access to. It is that ardent longing for which men  strictly  follow
the vow of  <i>brahmacaryam</i> or voluntary celibacy.  <i>Padam</i>  is  that  which  one
mentally proceeds to achieve the goal of their endeavours. <i>Padyate</i>  is  non-
different from <i>gamyate</i> meaning that  which  is  followed  being  the  method
adopted by the mind. The purport is that Lord  Krishna  is  giving  a  brief
description of the methodology by which  an  aspirant  for  <i>atma-tattva</i>  and
<i>moksa</i>  must  meditate  on  Him  to  achieve  the  ultimate  goal  they  have
envisioned. Meditation upon  Lord  Krishna  in  His  aspect  of  <i>aksaram</i>  or
imperishable is described in the Brihadaranya Upanisad V.VIII.VIII-XI.
