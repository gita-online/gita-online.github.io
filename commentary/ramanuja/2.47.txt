<i>Bhagavad-Gita: c</i><i>hapter 2, verse 49</i>
<p>
Actions performed with fruitive motivations  are  far  inferior  to  actions
performed as a  matter  of  duty.  The  mind  of  those  whose  actions  are
performed as a matter of duty are not disturbed or unbalanced  by  delusions
of  rewards  gained  or  lost.  The  activities   performed   in   spiritual
intelligence removes all suffering in the  world  and  leads  to  liberation
from  the  material  existence.  Contrarily  activities  performed  for  the
acquisition of rewards assuredly results in suffering and affliction in  the
material  existence.  <i>Phala-hetavah</i>   are  those  who  sole  motivation   is
dictated be the prospects of reward.  It  should  be  understood  that  such
living entities are <i>krpanah</i> or pitiable due to the fact but acting  in  this
way they are imprisoned in the material existence  unable  to  attain  their
spiritual nature.
