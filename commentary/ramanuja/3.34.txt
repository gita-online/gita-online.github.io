Lord Krishna confirms that a person who embarks upon the path of <i>jnana  yoga</i>
or the cultivation of  Vedic  wisdom  should  never  fall  again  under  the
influence of dualities as they work against  one  and  undermines  all  one'
efforts. The dualities of love and  hate,  attraction  and  aversion  are  a
persons most invincible enemies and  they  completely  frustrate  all  one's
attempts for success and higher understanding.
