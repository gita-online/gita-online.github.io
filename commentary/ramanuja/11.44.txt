Lord Krishna magnanimously expressed because He was prasannena tavarjunadam
meaning very pleased by Arjuna and thus exhibited His visvarupa or divine
universal form. The word tejo-mayam means resplendent and glorious, visvam
means all pervasive, anantam means infinite without beginning, middle or
end. The word adyam means first, the original, He who was before and prior
to all else and the words atma-yogat means by His own infallible free will
which manifests as His sakti or internal energy known as Yogamaya. Arjuna
was the Supreme Lords devotee who by His grace bequeathed upon him the
vision to see the visvarupa which had never been revealed on Earth before.
Next will be explained that except by bhakti or exclusive loving devotion
it is not possible by any means whatsoever to realise the Supreme Lord
Krishna and attain communion with Him.
