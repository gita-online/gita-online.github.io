When the senses are rambling about in pursuit  of  their  delights  and  one
allows their mind to follow in hot pursuit after them, then  the  mind  will
be deprived of its inherent intelligence and will completely forget all  the
things that lead to ones highest good.  Instead of inducing  a  strong  will
to pursue spiritual development one will develop a strong will  for  sensual
enjoyment. Thus Lord Krishna gives this fitting analogy of  a  ship  in  the
ocean being tossed about violently hither and thither by tempestuous  winds.
The conclusion of this rational is explained in the next verse.
