14 Lord Krishna's devotee who is not exultant upon  obtaining  things  which
cause joy in mortals, who hates nothing,  who  grieves  not  over
things that cause grief to mortals such as the  death  of  family
members, loss of wealth etc., who craves nothing being desireless
for anything in the material existence, who renounces both  pious
and impious acts knowing they both result in bondage to <i>karma</i>  or
reactions to actions.  Such  a  devotee  is  very  dear  to  Lord
Krishna.
