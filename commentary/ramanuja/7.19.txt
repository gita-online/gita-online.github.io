It takes not just a few births of performing righteous  activities  for  one
to evolve to the level of consummate  spiritual  wisdom  enough  to  realise
that the <i>atma</i> or soul  is  an  eternal  portion  of  the  Supreme  Lord  and
irrevocably devoted to Him. It takes innumerable  births  of  a  meritorious
kind in the thousands to achieve this platform and realise this and  in  the
final  birth  during  the  last  lifetime  in  the  material  existence  the
enlightened <i>jnani</i> knower  of  God  spontaneously  perceives  that  they  are
essentially a liege to the Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  totally  dependent  upon
Him, and the fact that all activities of the mind and body as  well  as  all
conceptions and perceptions are only of value if they have direct  relevance
to Him. This is the evolved wisdom of the illuminated <i>jnani.</i> Vasudeva  means
the Supreme Lord as the cause of all causes.  Such  a  <i>jnani</i>  always  thinks
Vasudeva is my way. Vasudeva is my goal. Vasudeva is my highest  attainment.
Whatsoever  my  heart  longs  for  that  is  Vasudeva  to  me.  Vasudeva  is
everything to to me. Such an elevated being totally devoted to  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna in causeless love is very rarely found in creation.  It  should
be evident that the two natures one being matter and the body and the  other
being spirit and the soul in their conditions of cause and effect  are  both
completely dependent  upon  the  Supreme  Lord  for  their  very  existence,
character, personality and impulses. Thus the one who is cognisant  of  this
reality possesses spiritual wisdom and is the <i>jnani.</i> That such  a  being  is
exceedingly rare is further expounded upon in the next verse.
