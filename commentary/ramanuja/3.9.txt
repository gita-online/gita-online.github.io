Instead of working hard to acquire funds for self  gratification  endeavours
which causes one to bound in the material  existence.  Activities  performed
as an offering to the Supreme Lord known as <i>yagna</i>  or  sacrifice  should  be
performed which are not bound to the material nature. Lord Krishna uses  the
word <i>sanga</i> which means attachment this means that attachment will  be  there
when the action is undertaken for self service but as  an  offering  to  the
Supreme Lord one is free from  such  ulterior  motivations.  All  activities
when done as an offering to the Supreme Lord with  anticipating  any  reward
become consecrated through <i>yagna</i> or acts of worship done  for  the  pleasure
of  <i>atma-purusha,</i>  the  Supreme  Lord  internally  within  the   heart   and
externally pervading  all  existence.  The  Supreme  Lord  recognising  such
devotion will mitigate all  the  sins  and  the  merits  from  such  offered
actions which bind  one  to  receiving  punishment  or  rewards  since  time
immemorial and neutralising them direct one from inside, and following  this
path with very little difficulty one can  achieve  self-realisation.  It  is
now shown that all persons of every segment  of  society  without  exception
must nourish  themselves  by  food  offered  as  <i>yagna</i>  consecrated  worship
exclusively and that sins are imbibed by all those who do not do so.
