The fundamental principles distinguishing the different  kinds  of  devotees
of the Supreme Lord  were  discussed  in  the  previous  chapter.  Now  Lord
Krishna reveals in this chapter:
<p>
<p>
The glorious magnificence and greatness of the object  of  devotion,  the
<i>Parama Purusa</i> or Supreme Being will be delineated.
<p>
<p>
The importance of the saintly  devotees  of  the  Supreme  Lord  will  be
explained.
<p>
<p>
The nature of  <i>bhakti</i> or pure love in devotion will be examined.
<p>
<p>
Lord Krishna uses the word <i>anusuyave</i> which means without duplicity.  Such  a
sincere person is naturally honest and of a spiritual  disposition  is  also
trusting. When such a person hears of the unlimited  glories  and  matchless
attributes of the Supreme Lord Krishna even though they are  being  revealed
by Him; such persons have full unadulterated  faith,  trust  and  confidence
that His words apply eternally and  are  undoubtedly  without  question  the
absolute reality. Such persons are qualified to  comprehend  this  knowledge
by which realising and then implementing it into one's  everyday  life  they
shall be relieved of all reactions and impurities  which  are  obstacles  in
the path to attainment of the Supreme Lord.
