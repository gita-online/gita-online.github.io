With a view of attaining  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  His
devotees enthusiastically perform <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to
Him. When  the  followers  of  this  path  who  are  always  reflecting  and
reminiscing about His <i>nama,</i> <i>rupa, guna, lila, dhama</i> find themselves  due  to
adverse circumstances unable to perform all their activities for  Him  alone
by which association with Him in loving  communion  would  surely  manifest;
then let them launch  on  the  path  of  <i>aksaram</i>  or  the  imperishable  and
eruditely contemplate the nature of the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul  as  delineated
in chapter two which would gradually fructify into <i>bhakti</i> eventually if  the
prerequisite condition to renounce the desire for the rewards of  all  one's
actions was accomplished, then <i>atma tattva</i> or soul realisation  is  insured.
The word <i>yatatmavan</i> means of controlled mind which denotes a mind  that  has
been trained to perform activities  without  desiring  for  rewards  in  the
intangible form of prestige and recognition or the  tangible  form  of  gain
and position. It is only to such a one entirely free from all  thoughts  and
desires of compensation and calculation,  cleansed  of  all  sins  will  the
Supreme Lord Krishna be their total object of affection  and  love.  Such  a
person will focus the fullness of all of  their  love  on  Lord  Krishna  as
their sole ultimate goal.
All their actions are actually forms of Lord Krishna's worship as  they  are
performed for His satisfaction or as a matter of duty  without  craving  for
any rewards. Meditation on the <i>atma</i>  results  in  the  obliteration  of  all
obstacles and impediments and the eradication of  <i>avidya</i>  or  ignorance  and
confers realisation of the <i>atma</i> as being eternal  and  purely  spiritual  in
totality and essentially a part of  Lord  Krishna's  internal  nature.  When
this communion has been experienced then love of God  erupts  in  the  heart
and becomes a natural occurrence. This topic will be further  delineated  in
chapter 18, verses 53 and 54.
