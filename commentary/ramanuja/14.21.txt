The word <i>lingais</i> means symptoms. By what symptoms can a liberated  being  be
perceived? What distinguishes  them  from  others?  The  word  <i>acarah</i>  means
conduct. By what means does such a liberated being conduct themselves?   How
does one transcend the three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature.  These
questions will be answered by Lord Krishna next.
