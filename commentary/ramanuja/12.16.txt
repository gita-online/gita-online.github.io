The path of <i>dharma</i> or eternal righteousness which is holy and that which  is
<i>amritam</i> is immortal is known as <i>bhakti</i> or  exclusive  loving  devotion  unto
the Supreme Lord Krishna and is the means as well  as  the  goal.  This  was
briefly emphasised in verse  two  of  this  chapter  with  the  <i>nitya-yuktas</i>
<i>upasate</i> meaning engaged in constant devotional worship  were  <i>yuktatamah</i>  or
the  most  superior  of  all.   Whosoever   devotes   themselves   to   this
transcendental path of <i>bhakti</i> as enumerated in the previous seven verses  is
a true devotee of Lord Krishna and very dear to Him.
