What in the universe and all creation is not a  part  of  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna. He is the knower of all that is known and knowable.  He  abides  as
the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul within all living entities. He is the highest  goal
yet He is beyond the highest goal. All existences past, present and  future,
sentient as well as insentient are impregnate  with  the  Supreme  Lord  who
resides within them as the eternal principle in the form of the <i>atma.</i>  Hence
all such terms as  eternal,  unlimited,  imperishable,  indestructible  etc.
refer to Him exclusively.
