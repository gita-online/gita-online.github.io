If one somehow or other was diverted and diverged almost at completion  from
the path of <i>yoga</i> or the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion with the ultimate consciousness; then they  would  be  born  in  a
family of enlightened sages or those illuminated within from the  perfection
of <i>yoga.</i> In both these cases it is extremely rare for one to take  birth  in
either situation but when it does occasionally manifest it is the result  of
the efficacy of <i>yoga</i> that had been almost perfected  in  the  previous  life
and was not possible to complete due to expiration of life.
