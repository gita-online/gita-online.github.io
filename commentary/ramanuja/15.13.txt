Lord Krishna declares that He is <i>vaisvanara</i> the digestive fire  which  joins
together with the vital  breaths  of   <i>prana</i>  or  exhalation  and  <i>apana</i>  or
inhalation. Together they digest in the  stomach  the  four  kinds  of  food
which are foods that are <i>khadva</i>  or  chewed,  <i>soshva</i>  or  sucked,  <i>lehya</i>  or
licked and <i>peya</i> or drank.  In  these  last  three  verses  Lord  Krishna  is
specifying integral functions of the <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings  and  of  the
Earth that are manifestations of His opulent glories. The  expressions  that
He becomes the light of  the  sun, moon and fire etc. are meant to  indicate
the predicated relationship that theses object have in regard to  Him.  That
fact  that  such  realtionships  exist  in  reference  to  all   things   is
substantiated in the next verse.
