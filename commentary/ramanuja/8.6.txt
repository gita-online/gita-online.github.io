Whatever image prominently floats in one's thoughts at the moment  of  death
and one leaves one's physical body with that final thought one  will  become
in their very next life. This is  what  Lord  Krishna  is  stating  in  this
verse. Their final thought  will  become  form.  One's  final  thought  will
naturally be what was constantly  reflected  upon  and  mediated  on  during
their span of life based upon one's association and daily habits.
