We learn from the Vedic  scriptures  that  those  who  lose  their  physical
bodies fighting  for  righteousness  receive  superior  physical  bodies  in
heavenly spheres of blessedness.  Such  a  transition  can  be  compared  to
discarding old, used, worn out clothes and attiring oneself  in  fresh,  new
raiment. So from another angle of vision it  is  being  confirmed  that  the
eternal soul is indestructible changing its embodied form for  another  when
the physical body  perishes.  Now  in  the  next  verse  some  examples  are
emphasised to give a more developed and comprehensive understanding of  this
indestructibility in the next verse.
