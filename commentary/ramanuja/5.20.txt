Here Lord Krishna describes the reality for the person who desists from
attachments to anything except the atma or eternal soul and who derives all
pleasures exclusively from their internal relationship with the atma
relinquishing all desires for sensuous material enticements and instead
delighting in brahma-yoga or the science of the individual consciousness
attaining communion with the Ultimate Consciousness by realising the
spiritual substratum pervading all existence. Such a person attains sukham-
aksayam or imperishable happiness. Next it will be illustrated how desire
for material sense gratification can be easily abandoned.
