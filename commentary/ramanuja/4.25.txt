Lord Krishna begins with the word <i>daivam</i> meaning the demi-gods. <i>Karma  yogis</i>
or those following the path of prescribed Vedic activities being on a  lower
platform devotedly worship the demigods  such  as  Indra  for  rainfall  and
Surya for sunlight and derive the desired results sought.  While  the  <i>jnana</i>
<i>yogis</i> those following the path of  cultivating  knowledge  offer  all  their
oblations such as <i>ghee</i> or clarified butter and food grains exclusively  into
the fire as offerings to the <i>Brahman</i> or spiritual substratum  pervading  all
existence and this is their <i>yagna</i> or worship to the Supreme.
