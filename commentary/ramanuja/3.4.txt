Neither by not performing the activities prescribed in the Vedic  scriptures
nor  by  abandoning  them  once  they  were  begun  does  one   attain   the
qualification to perform <i>jnana yoga</i> the cultivation of spiritual  knowledge.
This is because that actions when performed as worship for the Supreme  Lord
for His satisfaction alone with no desire  or  expectation  for  any  reward
leads to perfection and without this consciousness one is not qualified  for
<i>jnana yoga.</i> For in <i>jnana yoga</i> exclusive attention is devoted to  <i>atma-nistha</i>
deep faith in knowledge and meditation of the soul. This  is  only  possible
for one who has relinquished all desires and expectations fully. It  is  not
possible for one who is still mired in the pursuit of  fruitive  activities,
burdened with sins from previous lives and for one who has never  worshipped
Lord Krishna with love and devotion with no anticipation of reward.
