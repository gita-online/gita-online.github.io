In the seventh chapter Lord Krishna discoursed on the nature  of  <i>Parabrahma</i>
the Supreme Being, <i>Vasudeva</i> the Supreme cause of all causes, the  object  of
worship being:
1) The spiritual sovereignty  of  all  living  entities,  sentient  and  the
insentient.
2) The source and cause of all there is.
3) The support and preservation of everything
4) The ultimate reference of all language used as  an  expression  of  ideas
which normally relate either to the Supreme  Lord's  <i>rupa</i>  which  is  His
form, or His <i>guna</i> which are His qualities. The ultimate  reference  being
the Supreme Lord  Himself  of  whom  all  beings  in  existence  are  His
transcendental <i>rupa</i> and all things existing arise from His transcendental
<i>gunas.</i> 
<i>5) Isvara Parama</i> or the Supreme Controller
6)  The  most  exalted  and  glorious  by  the  possession  of  omniscience,
omnipresence, and omnipotence, and by the possession of  all  power,  all
beauty, all knowledge, all opulence, all fame and all renunciation.

Then  Lord  Krishna  went  on  to  explain  the  reasons  why  His   supreme
indomitable nature is concealed and inscrutable for normal human beings  due
to their committing iniquitous deeds in past lives from time immemorial  and
also being addicted to gratification of desires with the delights which  the
physical body and five senses stimulate while  being  covered  with  varying
degrees of the triple qualities of <i>sattva</i> or goodness, <i>rajas</i> or passion  and
<i>tamas</i> or ignorance.
<p>
Lord Krishna then revealed by what means this illusionary  delusion  can  be
removed by an embodied being who develops firm faith  in  the  Supreme  Lord
and surrenders to  Him,  due  to  the  grace  of  the  spiritual  master  in
Vedically authorised disciplic succession. This  faith  and  resignation  to
the Supreme Lord manifests in following the instructions  of  the  spiritual
master and results in the  performance  of  highly  meritorious  activities.
Lord Krishna also showed how the differences in merit  produces  differences
in results for  different  aspirants  being  the  <i>atharthis</i>  or  seekers  of
fortune, the <i>jijnansur</i> or aspirants for realisation of the soul and  <i>jnani's</i>
or seekers of the Supreme Lord. It was also  shown  how  out  of  all  these
aspirants the <i>jnani</i> was the most exalted. The eminence of  the  <i>jnani's</i>  was
derived from their constant devotion and unwavering  love  for  the  Supreme
Lord exclusively, thus they became an object of the Supreme Lord  who  loves
to reciprocate, warmest affection; but such a devotee of  the  Supreme  Lord
is rarely seen and very  difficult  to  find.  In  conclusion  Lord  Krishna
mentioned several requisites of knowledge  which  the  three  classes  being
<i>atharthi's, jijnansur's and jnani's</i> have to be knowledgeable of and  act  in
accordance to in order to realise the individual goals  of  future  felicity
which each class aspires for. Arjina continues asking questions in the  next
verse as well.
