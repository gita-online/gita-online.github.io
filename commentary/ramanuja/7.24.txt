Lord Krishna's supreme, infinite and exalted nature is that He is the
adorable by all acts of worship He is to be adored. Lord Krishna is the God
of the gods, the Supreme Lord of all, whose essence and attributes are
inexpressible by speech and unfathomable by thought. Although Lord Krishna
appears as the son of King Vasudeva and is actuated by activities of
affection to family members and compassion for all beings in order to be
accessible to all, He never relinquishes His transcendental divine nature
always maintaining His eternal spiritual presence. Foolish people oblivious
to this reality look upon Him as any other son born in royalty to a king,
awarded such position by the destiny of karma or reaction to past actions
brought into patency from an antecedent state of latency. Such living
entities do not seek the Supreme Lord as their shelter neither do they
worship Him by their actions. The reason why this is so for them is
explained in the next verse.
