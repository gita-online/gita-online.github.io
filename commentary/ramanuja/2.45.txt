<i>Bhagavad-Gita: c</i><i>hapter 2, verse 47</i>
<p>
Lord Krishna instructs Arjuna that for one who is fixed in  goodness,  whose
sole aim  is  for  liberation;  the  routine  of  performing  daily  duties,
occasional  duties  and   fruit   bearing   duties   should   be   performed
automatically and whatever recompense assigned to each of them   should  not
be hankered for desiring rewards and benefits or else it  becomes  fruitive.
The desire for reward and benefits has a binding effect  keeping  one  bound
in the material existence. But free from these impediments the  same  action
performed as worship to the Supreme Lord  becomes  the  veritable  means  to
secure liberation. Therefore be devoid of motive for actions nor  desire  to
reap the reward from actions. Though all living entities  are  acting  their
part in this  world,  those  who  are  situated  in  goodness  aspiring  for
liberation are considered not to be entangled as so. It  can  be  understood
that when one eats the  hunger  one  had  is  appeased  and  the  desire  is
satisfied as well; yet one would not consider theirself as the cause of  the
appeasal and satisfaction.
