Lord Krishna is declaring that the higher and lower natures of  <i>prakriti</i>  or
material nature  both are constituted as His dual  nature  in  the  material
existence.  This  dual  nature  consists  of  <i>chit</i>  or  sentient  and  <i>achit</i>
insentient categories. This dual nature is the basis and foundation for  all
existence sentient and insentient. This  dual  nature  is  the  power  which
designs and models according to qualifications all forms and potencies  from
the highest material entity, being Brahma to a blade  of  grass.  This  dual
nature is the matrix for all intelligent and non-intelligent  configurations
and manifestations. This dual nature solely manifests from Lord Krishna  and
constitutes  the  substratum  of  all  material  things.  He  alone  is  the
originator, the manifestor, the projector and the  retractor  of  the  total
creation by only a fraction of His will.
<p>
This dual nature of <i>chit</i> and <i>achit</i> being  the  collective  compound  of  all
creation exists within the complete nature of the Supreme Lord as merely  an
infinitesimal fragment of the total. This is given in  <i>sruti</i>  and  <i>smrti</i>  or
revealed Vedic scriptures as evidenced in the Subala  Upanisad:II  beginning
<i>mahan avyak ta liyate  aksharam  tamasi  liyate</i>  which  means:The  <i>mahat</i>  or
primal manifestation revolves back  into  <i>avyakta</i>  the  unmanifest,  <i>avyakta</i>
manifests into  <i>akshara</i>  the  supra  subtle  invariable  substance,  <i>akshara</i>
devolves into <i>tamas</i> the primordial undifferentiated basic substratum of  the
original  <i>prakriti</i>  which  is  complete  darkness.  This  is  a  homogeneous
refraction of nebulosity substratum existing as a diametrical reflection  of
the nebula within the Supreme Being.
<p>
What is described by Lord Krishna as <i>prakriti</i> in its dual forms of <i>chit</i>  and
<i>achit</i> as well as the <i>atma</i> or the soul all merge into <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme
Soul and <i>paramatma</i> is source and the support of  all  manifesting  from  the
highest as an emanation from the Supreme Lord Krishna as  eulogised  in  all
the Vedas and Vedantas. In as such as He is the cause of the  cause  of  all
things and the source of the source of all beings and in as much  as  He  is
the Supreme Controller of all that is sentient  and  insentient  and  in  as
much as He is  Supreme  Power  energising  and  maintaining  all  existence,
possessing  phenomenally  glorious  attributes   and   astonishing   amazing
qualities; Lord  Krishna  is  paramount  and  superior  to  everything  with
nothing existing beyond Him and nothing existing separate from Him.  Nor  is
there any God or demigod, or any other  being  in  existence  who  possesses
even a fraction of His attributes and qualities nor does any being have  the
competence to even imitate His imperishable cosmic potencies.
