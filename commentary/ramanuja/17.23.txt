The Supreme  Lord  Krishna  explains  that  the  word  SAT  denotes  eternal
existence and perpetual goodness. The words  <i>sad-bhave</i>  exemplifies  eternal
existence and the words <i>sadhu-bhave</i> exemplifies  perpetual  goodness.   This
is the correct understanding in which SAT  is  to  be  comprehended  in  the
Vedas as well as its utilisation by the  recitation  of  SAT  in  prescribed
Vedic  rituals  performed  exclusively  by  the  Vaisnavas  and   brahmanas.
Similarly the transcendental sound of SAT may be evoked for  any  auspicious
activity ordained  by  the  Vedic  scriptures  by  duly  initiated  Vaisnava
brahmanas in  any  of  the  480,000  types  of  humans  existing  throughout
creation.
<p>
To follow the prescribed Vedic duties of <i>yagna</i> or propitiation  and  worship
by the Vaisnava brahmanas, <i>tapah</i> or austerities by the <i>ksatriyas</i>  the  royal
warrior class and <i>danam</i> or charity by the <i>vaisyas</i> or merchant class are  all
considerd  in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  or  mode   of   goodness   because   they   are
conscientiously following  the  ordinances  and  injunctions  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. Thus all such activities are known  as  SAT  denoting  perpetual
goodness and due to  being  dedicated  to  the  Supreme  Lord  they  possess
auspicious attributes of an eternal nature and for this they are also  known
as SAT.
<p>
Thus the relationship of OM  TAT  SAT  to  the  Vedas,  the  performance  of
prescribed Vedic activities performed by Vaisnava  brahmanas  and  protected
by the <i>ksatriyas</i> while supported  by  the  <i>vaisyas</i>  clearly  and  succinctly
demonstrates what is  factually  Vedic  in  society  and  what  is  actually
situated in <i>sattva guna</i> while simultaneously clarifying  comprehensively  by
the logic of opposing parallels what  is  not  Vedic  in  society  and  thus
doomed to the perdition of exclusion from  the  ascending  orbit  of  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna.</i>
