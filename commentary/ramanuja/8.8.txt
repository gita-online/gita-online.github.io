By the daily practice of regulated meditation the  mind  becomes  fixed  and
does not wander or meander away from the point of  focused  attention.  With
the mind so habituated and properly trained in meditation, the Supreme  Lord
Krishna is to be fixed in one's mind as the final thought  at  the  time  of
death up to and including the last moment. So thinking of the  Supreme  Lord
at such a crucial moment as death is the pivotal point  in  human  existence
for one can thus attain Him in the spiritual worlds. This will be  explained
in more detail in the next two verses.

It should be clearly understood that by thought alone one achieves  whatever
one desires, whether it is the Supreme Lord or dominion over the  worlds  or
great fortune, etc. Whereas Jada Bharata left the human species  and  became
an animal due to reflecting upon the welfare of a  deer;  a  person  by  the
power of their meditation will be born  with  qualities  comparable  to  the
Supreme Lord by meditating upon  Him  at  the  moment  of  death.  The  word
<i>abhyasa</i> is the habituating and training of the mind  to  meditate  upon  the
focused object of attention in a  regulated  manner.  Whereas  <i>yoga</i>  or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness is a mode of meditation  with  fixed  procedures  and
fixed times everyday <i>abhyasa</i> is a mode of meditation beyond the times  one's
set  aside  for  regular  daily  and  special  occasions;  <i>abhyasa</i>  mode  of
meditation is more of a continuous phenomena in all activities of life.
