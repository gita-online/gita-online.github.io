<i>Bhagavad-Gita: c</i><i>hapter 2, verse 45</i>
<p>
Here we see the word <i>traigunya</i> indicating the three  qualities  of  material
nature being goodness, passion and ignorance. This term refers to the  three
groups of living entities characterised under the influence of  these  three
aforementioned qualities. If the Vedic  scriptures  did  not  address  these
three  classes  according  to  their  predilections   by   prescribing   the
appropriate method for  attainment  of  the  heavenly  spheres,  then  those
living entities under the  influence  of  passion  and  ignorance  would  be
adverse to goodness unwittingly hindering  their  own  progress.  Also  they
would be in the dark as to how to  advance  themselves  from  their  present
position and being lost compounded by being full of desires they would  fall
into degradation falsely fancying it to lead the way to their goal;  and  in
vain they would be ruined. Hence the Vedic scriptures contain all  that  the
three classification  of  living  entities  possessing  different  qualities
could desire. But ideally  one  should  free  themselves  from  passion  and
ignorance and devote oneself to increasing the quality  of  goodness  fully.
This increase should be pure without any dilution of passion  and  ignorance
all intermixture should be fully purged. The  word  <i>nirdvandvah</i>  means  free
from duality, devoid of any  influence  of  material  nature.  <i>Nitya-sattva-</i>
<i>sthah</i>  is one who is ever wedded to increasing goodness  without  any  trace
of passion and ignorance. How is this to be accomplished? By being <i>nir-yoga-</i>
<i>ksema</i> meaning one  is  completely  unconcerned  about  acquiring  any  other
advantage apart from the realisation of the soul and  the  means  to  effect
that end. By this method one becomes <i>atmavan</i> or established in the soul.  If
one conducts oneself in this manner and  remains  fixed,  the  influence  of
passion and ignorance will cease and goodness will become predominant.
