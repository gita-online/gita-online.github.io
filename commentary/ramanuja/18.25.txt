Now Lord Krishna describes the threefold  effects  of  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or
modes of material nature on a performer of activity  beginning  with  <i>sattva</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of goodness.
<i>1) muktah-sangah</i> is free from attachment  and  exempt  from  desires  for
results.
<i>2) anaham-vadi</i> is free from egoism as the doer and hence devoid of pride.
<i>3) dhrti</i> is fortitude and  determination  in  surmounting  all  odds  for
accomplishment.
<i>4)  utsaha</i>  is  enthusiasm  and  zeal  in  undertaking  prescribed  Vedic
activities.
The words <i>siddhy-asiddhyor nirvikarah</i> means equipoise in success or  failure
of all activities, realising that all results  are  under  the  auspices  of
<i>karma</i> or reactions to actions and the ultimate will  of  the  Supreme  Lord.
Such consciousness is situated in <i>sattva guna.</i>
