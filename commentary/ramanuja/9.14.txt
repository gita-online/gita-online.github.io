The <i>mahatmanas</i> or great souls being overwhelmed with intense  love  for  the
Supreme Lord find it impossible to  support  their  existence  for  even  an
infinitesimal part of a moment without  always  being  engaged  in  chanting
Lord Krishna's holy names, singing His  glories,  enlightening  one  another
about His <i>lilas</i> or divine pastimes, offering  obeisance  and  salutation  to
Him with worship and propitiation and the  offering  of  their  very  selves
with loving devotion. With tremulous voices convulsed  with  holy  joy  they
with yearning tones they  incessantly  call  out  His  holy  names  such  as
Krishna, Rama, Narayana, Hari which connote  distinguishable  attributes  of
His Supreme nature. They constantly remember His <i>lilas</i> with tears  in  their
eyes with their bodies ecstatically quivering in rapture,  thrilled  by  the
exciting recollection of such holy revelations. With  equal  zeal  do  still
other <i>mahatmanas</i>  assiduously perform holy duties of sacred worship  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorized <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and
expansions as revealed Vedic scriptures.  with  firm  determination.  Others
engage themselves in  the  constructions  of  temples  of  worship  for  the
Supreme Lord along with laying out of flower and fruit gardens for  the  His
service.  Still  others  overcome  by  sacred   devotion   fully   prostrate
themselves upon the ground with  all  eight  parts  of  their  body  like  a
fragile reed regardless of dust, dirt or prickling  thorns  and  pebbles  in
humble obeisance to the Supreme Lord. The eight parts of the  body  are  the
heart, the intellect, the  ego,  the  head,  the  two  hands  and  two  feet
prostrating in unison with concerted devotion. Always striving with  prayers
of devotion and love for Lord Krishna, focused with the aim to be  eternally
united with Him, with fervid appeal they beseech Him incessantly  again  and
again that they may attain Him solely as their only goal.
