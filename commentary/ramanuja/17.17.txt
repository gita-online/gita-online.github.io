It is a duty to offer <i>danam</i> or charity to worthy  recepients.  Lord  Krishna
explains that <i>danam</i> that is offered without  expectation  of  reward,  hopes
for services or wishing anything in return that is offered at an  auspicious
place, at an auspicious time to spiritually enlightened Vaisnavas  brahmanas
steeped in the conclusive  knowledge  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  is  to  be
understood as the best of <i>danam</i> and situated in  <i>sattva  guna</i>  the  mode  of
goodness.
