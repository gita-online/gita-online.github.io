In order to kindle great affection for <i>bhakti</i> or excluisve  loving  devotion
unto the Supreme Lord and fan the flame until combustion  with  the  reality
about the  nature  of  divinity  and  encompassing  all  things  within  and
withiout, accompanied by a multitude of expressions of  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine,
transcendental   opulence,   sublime   and   phenomenal   which    partially
characterise the  unlimited  qualities,  attributes  and  potencies  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna. This has all been delineated in the previous  chapters
and contingent upon this reality the understanding that  all  differing  and
contrary natures, everything that is  <i>cit</i>  or  sentient  and  <i>acit</i>  or  non-
sentient and their substance, their manifestation and  their  span  of  life
along with  their  derivation  from  the  divine  nature  are  actually  one
perfectly harmonising consciousness flowing through all existence  and  this
has also been explicitly explained.

Previously Arjuna had been labouring under the false illusion of loving  his
perishable physical body as if it  was  the  imperishable  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal
soul. Lord Krishna has  compassionately  dispelled  such  misconceptions  by
completely revealing in chapter two the eternal  nature  of  the  <i>atma.</i>  The
word <i>adhyatma</i> or wisdom of the  eternal  soul  is  that  which  is  embodied
within Srimad Bhagavad-Gita beginning in chapter two, verse  12  and  ending
in chapter six, verse 46
<p>
Having learned these essential and esteemed  subject  matters  such  as  the
eternality of the <i>atma</i>, the singular oneness of the  Supreme  Lord  and  the
dependence of all things moving and non-moving for their very  existence  on
Him  from  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  Himself,  Arjuna  has  come  to  the
conclusion that  everything  Lord  Krishna  has  revealed  is  the  complete
absolute truth.  But  desiring  to  perceive  this  with  His  faculties  of
perception he queries the Supreme Lord further as will be  revealed  further
in this chapter
