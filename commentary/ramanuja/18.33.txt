The <i>dhrita</i> or determination that is influenced by  <i>raja  guna</i>  the  mode  of
passion is  motivated  by  desire  for  rewards  and  desires  for  <i>kama</i>  or
enjoyment and <i>artha</i> or wealth and hopes for <i>dharma</i>  or  righteousness  keeps
the impetus activated. For these are the means by  which  one  interacts  in
life using the mind, senses and physical body;  but  the  rewards  that  are
reaped are only material and temporary. <i>Moksa</i> or  liberation  form  material
existence is never able to be achieved if one is motivated for  rewards  for
their actions. So Lord Krishna has confirmed that  activities  which  engage
the mind, senses and body for the  purpose  of  <i>recompense</i>  and  rewards  is
situated totally in <i>raja guna</i> and  although  may  achieve  <i>kama,  artha</i>  and
<i>dharma</i> such activities can never bestow <i>moksa.</i>
