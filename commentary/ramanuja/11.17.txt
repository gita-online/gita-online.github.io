The Vedic scriptures known as the Upanisads declare also that  Lord  Krishna
is <i>aksaram paramam</i> the Supreme immutable ultimate reality  and  declared  in
the Vedic scriptures as that which  is  essential  to  be  known.  The  word
<i>veditavyam</i> means He is only to be know by  the  absolute  authority  of  the
Vedas. The word <i>avyayah</i> means that which is imperishable and  can  never  be
diminished for in whatever aspect or  form  or  manifestation  Lord  Krishna
wills to be that will eternally  be  existing.  The  phrase  <i>sasvata-dharma-</i>
<i>gopta</i> means the Supreme Lord Krishna is the  eternal  preserver  of  eternal
righteousness embodied in the Vedic scriptures. This is done by Himself  and
by His authorised <i>avatars</i> o  incarnations  and  expansions  as  revealed  in
Vedic scriptures such as Narayana, Rama, Vishnu, Narasimhadeva, Buddha  etc.
The words <i>sanatanas tvam puruso</i> means Lord Krishna  is  the  eternal  spirit
and primal consciousness of  all  creation  as  affirmed  in  the  Taittriya
Upanisad III.XII beginning <i>vedaham  etam  purusam</i>  meaning  I  perceive  the
magnificent Purusa. Also in the Mundaka Upanisad I.I.IV beginning <i>dve  vidye</i>
<i>veditavye</i> meaning: The Purusa is more sublime than  the  most  sublime.  All
this is as the  ornament  of  the  complete  cosmic  creation  Lord  Krishna
exhibited His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form and is understood as such.
