Lord Krishna is declaring that which is most worthy  to  be  known  is  that
which is most worthy to strive for and be gained and that is realisation  of
the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul. This realisation is attained by imbibing  the  20
attributes heretofore mentioned previously. Here the  word  <i>amritam</i>  meaning
nectar denotes the nectar of immortality and refers  directly  the  immortal
soul exempt from the pangs of birth,  decrepitude  and  death.  <i>Anadi</i>  means
that which has no beginning for as the <i>atma</i> has no birth it  has  no  ending
and is eternal. The Katha Upanisad I.II.XVIII beginning <i>najayate mriyate  va</i>
<i>vipascit</i> means that the <i>atma</i> is without birth and death. The  compound  <i>mat-</i>
<i>param</i> clarifies that the <i>atma</i> is both a part of  the  Supreme  Lord  who  is
present within as <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme Soul and always subordinate to  Him.
The  Svetasvatara  Upanisad   VI.IX   beginning   <i>sakaranam   karana   dhipa</i>
<i>dhipo</i> means: The Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes  and  the  lord  of
the lord of the senses for Him there is no Lord or  progenitor.  Further  in
the same chapter VI.XVI beginning <i>pradhana ksetrajna patir gunesah</i>  meaning:
The Supreme Lord who is endowed with all auspicious qualities  is  the  lord
of the field of activities, the knower of the field of activities.
<p>
The <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  is  great
because the <i>atma</i> which is a separate entity from the physical body  is  part
of it. <i>Brahman</i> is derived from  the  root  word  <i>brh</i>  which  means  becoming
great. So it is included as part of <i>ksetra-jna.</i> The <i>brahman</i> is infinite  and
the <i>atma</i> is infinite as well. The Svetasvatara Upanisad V.IX states   <i>sachan</i>
<i>anthyaya kalpate</i>  meaning:  The  <i>atma</i>  is  infinite.  The  <i>atma's</i>  seemingly
limitation in a physical body  is  due  to  <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  from  past
actions; but once a <i>jiva</i> or embodied  being  achieves  <i>moksa</i>  or  liberation
then the actual infinite and limitless nature of the <i>atma</i> is percieved.  The
<i>brahman</i> is neither <i>sat</i> existence or  <i>asat</i>  non-existence  because  it  never
undergoes any modifications or transformations due to its being  beyond  the
influence of cause and effect. The term <i>brahman</i> can also be  used  to  refer
to the <i>atma</i> as will be seen later in chapter 14, verse  26  and  chapter  18
verse 54. When the <i>atma</i> assumes names and forms <i>sat</i>  becomes applicable  and
when the <i>atma</i> is bereft of names and forms it is <i>asat.</i> Thus it is  factually
beyond both. This is also revealed in the Tattiriya Upanisad  II.VII.IX  and
the Rig Veda VIII.VII.XVII which states: All was <i>asat</i>  in the beginning  and
from it <i>sat</i> arose. So everything was first  unmanifest  and  then  was  made
manifest into names and forms through successive  transformations  of  cause
and effect and such modifications surrounding the <i>atma</i> are due to its  karma
of having to accept embodiment brought on by <i>avidya</i> or ignorance and is  not
inherent in the actual nature of the <i>atma</i> itself. Thus  the  nature  of  the
<i>atma</i> is undefinable by any and all conceptions of <i>sat</i> and <i>asat</i>.
<p>
When the Vedic scriptures refer to <i>asat</i> as being in the beginning  they  are
alluding to the unmanifest casual state before existence  is  activated  and
commences.  In this state both <i>cit</i> conscious spirit as  the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>  and
<i>acit</i> inert matter as the <i>ksetra</i> are both present but in a dormant state  and
could be designated as <i>asat.</i> But the <i>brahman</i> and the <i>atma</i> being eternal  and
part of the <i>ksetra-jna</i> are transcendent to both <i>sat</i> and <i>asat</i> except  by  the
accountability and allotment of <i>karma</i> to the  <i>jiva</i>  due  to  reactions  from
past activities.
