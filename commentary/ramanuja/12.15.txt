The absence of hate towards any being in general  has  already  iterated  by
Lord Krishna in verse 13 of this chapter with the word <i>advesta</i> meaning  free
of hatred  but  that  is  in  a  general  sense  towards  every  being.  The
equanimity mentioned here is of a more  profound  nature  that  of   keeping
one's equanimity when seeing one in front of them face  to  face.  The  word
<i>aniketah</i> means unattached to home or fixed residence  due  to  being  firmly
attached to <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord.
Equally balanced in praise and censure, happiness and misery,  pleasure  and
pain etc. Such a devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna is very dear to Him.
