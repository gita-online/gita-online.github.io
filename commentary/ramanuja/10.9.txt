The words <i>satata-yuktanam</i>  means  those  who  constantly  aspires  for  Lord
Krishna's association.  They  aspire  by  incessantly  worshipping  Him  and
intensely meditating for communion with Him. To such persons out  of  loving
compassion, Lord Krishna gives them <i>buddhi-yogam</i> or  spiritual  intelligence
so that  their  individual  consciousness  can  attain  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness of the Supreme Lord and come to Him.
