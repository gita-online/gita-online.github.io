8 The Supreme Lord Krishna confirms that the qualities He is describing  are
applicable to <i>yo mad-bhaktah</i> which means His  exclusive  devotee.
The word <i>advesta</i> means free from hatred  for  any  being  at  any
time. <i>Maitrah</i> means benign and showing good  will  to  all,  both
well-wishers and ill-wishers by the understanding that  they  are
merely following the tendencies of the impulse imparted  to  them
by the Supreme Lord  in  relation  to  one's  own  good  and  bad
actions. <i>Karunah</i> means compassionate, to be  sympathetic  towards
the sufferings of others, friend and foe  alike.  <i>Nirmamah</i>  means
devoid  of  sentiments  of   possessiveness   and   ego   related
conceptions mine-ness regarding the  physical  body,  family  and
associated relationships and  objects.  <i>Nirahankarah</i>  means  free
from the false conception  of  thinking  one's  self  to  be  the
physical body and consequently unaffected  by  the  dualities  of
material  existence  such  as  pain  and  pleasure,  praise   and
ridicule, joy and grief, etc. all based upon the mentality of the
mind.  <i>Ksami</i>  means  tolerant,  to  be  unaffected  by   external
incidents such as physical accidents or  catastrophes.  <i>Santustah</i>
means always content with whatever comes along by its own  accord
for the purpose of bodily sustenance. <i>Satatam  yogi</i>  is  one  who
always engages  themselves  to  the  science  of  the  individual
consciousness attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness
in loving devotion to the Supreme Lord. <i>Satatam</i> means always  and
has two meaning:  one  is  to  be  continuously  and  perpetually
engaged in <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion to Lord Krishna at
every moment and two is to engage in this <i>bhakti</i> to Lord  Krishna
in all ways meaning in every possibility and facet of one's life.
<i>Yatatma</i> means the ability to govern and control the  workings  of
the mind. <i>Drdha-niscayah</i> means firmly resolved in  the  knowledge
of the Vedic scriptures regarding the immortality of the <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul and the Supreme Lord and irrevocably established  in
<i>bhakti</i>  to  the  Lord  Krishna.  <i>Arpita-mano-buddhir</i>  means   who
dedicates their intelligence and  consciousness  to  the  Supreme
Lord by performing activities dedicated to Him without desire for
recompense. Then when the Supreme Lord Krishna is  worshipped  in
this way He would Himself guide one internally  to  achieve  <i>atma</i>
<i>tattva</i> or realisation of the soul and attain communion with  Him.
One who possesses all these qualities is  very  dear  to  Supreme
Lord Krishna and is <i>me priyah</i> or the recepient of His love.
