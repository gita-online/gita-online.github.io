Preserverance of  the  aspirant  is  the  persistence  essential  to  insure
success once has  fully resorted to <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving  devotion  to
the Supreme Lord Krishna. By cultivating this path they purify  their  minds
and hearts by <i>yoga</i> or the individual consciousness attaining communion  with
the ultimate consciousness.  They  then  realise  the  true  nature  of  the
<i>atma</i> residing within the etheric heart of the physical body and perceive  it
distinctly  different  from  the  body.  But  if  their  efforts  even  if
industrous are devoid of sufficient faith in  the  spiritual  preceptor  and
unalloyed devotion to the Supreme Lord and  thus  spiritually  impotent  and
feeble minded, then they are handicapped and incapable  of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul. Hence they do not perceive it. Although  the  light
of the sun, the moon, lightning and fire are powerful antidotes to  removing
darkness, they are limited to removing only external darkness and they  have
this power due to their empowerment  by  the  divine  consciousness  of  the
Supreme Lord which has the capacity to remove the darkness of  ignorance  in
the phenomenal world externally and the darkness  of  ignorance  within  the
consciousness of the <i>jiva</i> internally.
