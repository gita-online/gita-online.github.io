Lord Krishna describes telltale signs and characteristics of  the  demoniac.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>Sambhavitah</i>  means  conceited,  self  aggrandizing.  The  demoniac   flatter
themselves.
<p>
<p>
<i>Stabdah</i> means impertinent, pompous. Thinking they are the  better  than  all
others.
<p>
<p>
<i>Dhana-mana-mada-anvizah</i>  means  inebriated  and   puffed   up   by   wealth,
bloodlines, etc.
<p>
<p>
<i>Avidhi-purvakam</i> means the  demoniac  do  pseudo  rituals  condemned  by  the
Vedas.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The  pseudo-rituals  enacted  by  the  demoniac  are   nothing   more   then
pretentious  exhibitions  of  ostentatious  decadence  regardless   of   the
opulence they are always void of  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord  and  are
performed  contrary  to  the  injunctions  and  ordinances  of   the   Vedic
scriptures.
