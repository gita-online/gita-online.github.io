For the most part persons who desire the material fruits  of  their  actions
never worship the Supreme Lord  Krishna  who  is  the  super  soul  existing
within all living beings and who is the ultimate recipient  of  all  worship
and offerings as confirmed in the previous verse. It  is  very  rarely  seen
that the materialists are inclined to His worship. Instead they worship  the
demi-gods and other lesser entities. Why  is  this  so?  It  is  because  by
worshipping them the seekers of material possessions such as  wealth,  power
and dominion  find  quick  results  in  the  fulfilment  of  their  material
desires. <i>Manuse loke</i> means in the mortal worlds. This includes all  material
worlds everywhere in creation. Such persons in  these  worlds  oblivious  to
the true purpose of human existence due to a  vast  accumulation  of  sinful
reactions  that  have  not  been  exhausted  from  time  immemorial.  Desire
immediate results for their actions  causing  them  to  get  more  and  more
reactions. Such people worship that which gives temporary  material  rewards
and  foolishly  pursue  transient   material   objectives   even   foolishly
attempting to gain   immortality in  their  corporeal  physical  body.  Only
such a rare being who fearful of  <i>samsara</i> or  transmigration  from  physical
body to physical body in the endless cycle of birth and death,  who  aspires
for <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the cycle of birth and death,  only  this  rare
being  would  engage  themselves  in  <i>karma  yoga</i>  or  the  performance   of
prescribed Vedic activities as propitiation to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna.
The next verse reveals how to release oneself from sin which obscures  one's
perception from realising the need to engage in <i>karma yoga.</i>
