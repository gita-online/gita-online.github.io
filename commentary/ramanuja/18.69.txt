The words <i>tvat prasadan</i> means by your grace. By the grace  of  Lord  Krishna
all illusion was dispelled. The word <i>tvat</i> is derived  from  <i>tvatvam</i>  meaning
eternal spiritual verities. The  word  <i>smriti</i>  means  wisdom,  enlightenment
concerning the absolute nature of <i>tvatvam.</i> By the Supreme Lord's Grace  this
was bestowed. <i>Smriti</i> consists in knowing that the <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul  is
distinct from matter, that the <i>atma</i> is  different  in  nature  from  matter,
that the <i>atma</i> is cognizant and existing equally in  all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings including humans, animals, fish, plants etc. and that the <i>atma</i> is  an
infinitesimal, eternal part of the Supreme Lord Krishna  is  dependent  upon
Him, under His direction and  always  in  allegiance  to  Him.  <i>Smriti</i>  also
consists in knowing that Lord Krishna is the sole origin  of  all  creation,
duration and dissolution of the complete  material  existence  and  all  its
myriad of unlimited variegated beings.  Knowing  that  He  is  the  opposing
antithesis to all that is evil. Knowing that He is  the  almighty  ocean  of
illustrious  attributes   such   omnipotence,   omniscience,   omnipresence,
unrivalled  power,  wisdom,  beauty,  wealth,  fame  and  renunciation.   In
knowing that Lord Krishna is He that is described so gloriously as the  goal
of the Vedic scriptures and in knowing that He  is  knowable  by  the  Vedic
scriptures. <i>Smriti</i> consists  in  knowing  that  Lord  Krishna  can  only  be
attained by <i>bhakti</i> exclusive loving  devotion  unto  Him.  Such  an  exalted
position is only achieved by knowledge of lower  and  higher,  what  is  the
ultimate and what is the minimal, what is to be accepted and what is  to  be
rejected. <i>Tvatvam</i> the eternal spiritual verities  are  to  be  embraced  all
else is to be discarded.

The word <i>moha</i> means illusion, the  obfuscation  of  absolute  knowledge  for
perverted knowledge.  <i>Moha</i>  is  also  infatuation  with  the  physical  body
believing it to be the actual self instead of just a vehicle  for  the  <i>jiva</i>
or embodied being <i>Moha</i> is also delusory misconceptions about the  nature  of
<i>karma</i> reactions from actions, the nature of <i>nitya</i> or the eternal  prescribed
Vedicduties and the nature of <i>naimittika</i>  the  occasional  prescribed  Vedic
duties. Erroneously thinking that devotional activities to the Supreme  Lord
lead to bondage.  Illusion is distorted knowledge which gives rise to  false
conceptions of relationships to  family,  friends,  race,  country,  planet,
etc. It also gives  false  conceptions  to  the  limitations  of  individual
freewill. Distorted knowledge perpetually manifests distorted knowledge.  By
the Supreme Lords Grace all such delusions, doubts and  misconceptions  have
been dispelled.
