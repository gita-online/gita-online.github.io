Whatever glories and wondrous phenomenal activities that manifest and  exist
as a result of the Supreme Lord Krishna; only He and He  alone  is  able  to
describe and elaborate upon them as only He alone is capable  of  displaying
them. His glories are unlimited and endless and as He is proficient  in  the
governing  of  all  creation  through  His  all  pervading  aspect  and  the
governing of all beings by His <i>paramatma</i> aspect within  all  beings  as  the
Supreme soul.
