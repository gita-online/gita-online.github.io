A <i>yogi</i> or  one  perfecting  the  science  of  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness, who  is  more  advanced
in <i>dhyana o</i> meditation is being described here by Lord  Krishna.  The  words
<i>ekatvam asthithah</i> means established in singular unity. This means  eschewing
the conception of  differences  arising  from  the  appearance  of  material
conditions and designations. It also infers the expansion  of  consciousness
during meditation to realise the  reality  of  Lord  Krishna's  omnipresence
everywhere in everything. The word  <i>sarvatha</i>  means  in  all  circumstances.
This means whether consciously performing  prescribed  Vedic  activities  or
immersed in mediatation, Whatever condition one happens to  be  situated  in
the <i>yogi</i> who is far advanced perceiving  <i>paramatma</i> or the  Supreme  Soul  in
himself as well as  all  beings  is  always  perceiving  and  relishing  the
presence of the Supreme Lord and worshipping Him at  all  times.  The  words
<i>mayi varttate</i> meaning exists within Lord Krishna.  This  means  by  dint  of
always meditating solely on Him, one experiences their own <i>atma</i> or  soul  as
well as the <i>atma</i> or soul of all beings and perceives that all <i>atma's</i> are  of
the same eternal essence as the Supreme Lord's.
