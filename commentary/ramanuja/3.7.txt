Controlling the senses by strength of mind,  utilising  them  to  assist  in
achieving <i>attma tattva</i> by performing the  prescribed  duties  given  in  the
Vedic scriptures according to the  natural  attributes  found  within  their
character by the natural disposition of their natural  impulses,  then  that
person although performing <i>karma yoga</i> the yoga of  actions  is  superior  to
the performer of  <i>jnana yoga</i> the yoga of  cultivating knowledge inasmuch  as
falsely performing <i>jnana yoga</i> with duplicity is far inferior  to  performing
<i>karma yoga</i> with sincerity.
