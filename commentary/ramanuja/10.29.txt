Lord Krishna reveals that of things that purify  and  things  that  are  the
swiftest His <i>vibhuti</i> or divine, transcendental opulence  is  the  wind.  The
words <i>sastra-bhrtam</i> means weapon wielding heroes of  which  His  <i>vibhuti</i>  is
Rama but unlike other <i>vibhuti</i> which are  indirect.  Rama  is  an  <i>avatar</i>  or
direct incarnation of the Supreme Lord  Krishna  who  manifests  Himself  as
Rama the paragon of weapon wielding heroes. Indirect <i>vibhutis</i>  such  as  the
Maruts or the Vasus are still <i>jivas</i> or embodied  souls  even  though  imbued
with a filament of  the  Supreme  Lords  potency.  In  relationship  to  the
Supreme Lord they are exactly like potencies  serving  Him  as  the  weapons
wielded by Rama are likewise serving Him.
