Forming  no  attachments  in  any  situation  means   to   be   indifferent,
unconcerned in an aloof state or attitude.  Auspicious is a  situation  that
is pleasing and inauspicious is  a  situation  that  is  displeasing.   Lord
Krishna is instructing not to be overjoyed by the  pleasing  nor  despondent
over the unpleasant. One who can  successfully  engage  themselves  thus  is
<i>sthita-prajna</i>  situated  in  the   perfect   knowledge   of   transcendental
consciousness. The next lower stage is given in the next verse.
