Lord Krishna is instructing Arjuna to arise from his lethargy  of  mind  and
fight for  righteousness.  By  vanquishing  the  Kauravas  he  will  acquire
lasting glory and enjoy the  prospering  kingdom  of  Earth  which  will  be
rightfully administered and protected by the Pandavas.  Lord  Krishna  alone
by Himself  has  already  determined  the  course  of  the  battle  and  the
destruction of all the  unrighteous.  In  this  work  Arjuna  is  merely  an
instrument and must only accept the role of conqueror  as  an  implement  of
war. Arjuna is addressed as <i>savya-sacin</i>  or  expert  archer  from  the  root
<i>shach</i> meaning equal. This was because he was ambidextrous and could  fix  an
arrow to a bow shooting it equally with left or right hand.
