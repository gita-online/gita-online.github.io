As a candle flame when sheltered from the wind will not  flicker  but  burns
bright and steady. The word <i>smrta</i> means evidenced and is cited by those  who
are experienced in the science  of  meditation  and  used  as  a  simile  to
illustrate how meditation on the <i>atma</i> or soul becomes steady  and  effulgent
to  that  <i>yogi</i>  or  one  perfected  in  the  science   of   the   individual
consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness  who
concentrates upon the <i>atma</i> after with drawing  the  mind  from  every  other
objects of attention. Lord Krishna is stating that the  <i>atma</i>  shines  steady
and radiant in the light of  meditative  spiritual  intelligence  by  reason
that all extraneous and miscellaneous distractions of  the  mind  have  been
sequestered out exactly as a candle flame shines constant  and  bright  when
all wind has been sequestered out from around it.
