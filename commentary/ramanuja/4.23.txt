By one's mind being entirely engrossed in <i>atma tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation
the  attachment  to  worldly  things  has  naturally  been   withdrawn.   So
automatically conceptions of  ownership  proprietorship  are  abandoned  and
realising  the  reality  of  the  Supreme  Being  and  the   importance   of
propitiation to Him one lives their life in such a  way  that  every  action
they perform is a  <i>yagna</i>  or  worship  and  offering  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna. All past accumulated  reactions  resulting  from  previous  actions
which bind  one  so  terribly  to  the  material  existence  are  completely
evaporated without any residue. The  spiritual  intelligence  of  performing
all actions in the perspective of the <i>atma</i> or  soul  rather  than  from  the
perspective of being immersed within the sense gardens  of  material  nature
has explained.  The next  verse  reveals  the  even  higher  perspective  of
comprehending that  spirit  behind  all  activities  and  their  factors  of
performance is the Supreme Spirit the Supreme Lord.
