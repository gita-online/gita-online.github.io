Lord Krishna states that other <i>yogis</i> or those practising the science of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness;  they  devote  themselves  to  <i>pranayama</i>  or  breath  control
consisting of three parts called <i>rechaka</i> or exhalation for 16 beats,  <i>puraka</i>
or inhaling for 32 beats and <i>kumbhaka</i> or cessation of breath for  64  beats.
For every breath the <i>prana</i> or  outgoing  breath  is  offerred  as  <i>yagna</i>  or
worship into the <i>apana</i> or incoming breath and the <i>apana</i> is offered into  the
<i>prana.</i> These <i>yogis</i>  require  light  diets  and  follow  strict  regimens  of
practice.
