Whether it is the divine, heavenly kingdoms, or the  human  worlds,  whether
the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being is advanced or primitive, whether the <i>jiva</i> is  of
a dark color or a light color, whether the <i>jiva</i> is of good character or  bad
character, whether the <i>jiva</i> occupies a form as an animal, bird  or  fish  or
even resides in a form in the stationary kingdoms of trees and plants,  Lord
Krishna declares that He is  the  refuge  to  all  and  independent  to  any
external  considerations  being  equal  to  all  without  distinction.   The
conception of inferiority due to lack  of  beauty,  absence  of  wealth,  no
education, menial position, low class family etc. is  not  an  obstacle  for
any one desiring to surrender to the Supreme Lord, accepting  Him  as  their
refuge. Neither  is  it  applicable  for  one  possessing  beauty,  abundant
wealth, good education, a high position  in  society  coming  from  a  first
class family to think that they are entitled to any  special  privileges  or
have the right to have access to the Supreme Lord  because  of  it.  Whoever
selects the Supreme Lord as their all in all, their life  and  their  refuge
exclusively, to them alone does the Supreme Lord accept and reciprocate  and
they due to their unflinching devotion are especially dear to  Him.  Whoever
whether they be of any  description,  who  worship  the  Supreme  Lord  with
<i>bhakti</i> or loving devotion which is most endearing. Who worships the  Supreme
Lord with a fervor that if interrupted would feel as if their very life  was
in peril. Who worships the Supreme Lord as the  sole  aim  and  goal  to  be
attained. Such beings regardless of any external position of inferiority  or
superiority would be  filled  with  such  blissful  blessedness  that  could
compare only with His own blissfulness.
