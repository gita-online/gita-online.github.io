When the light of <i>jnana</i> or knowledge is seen  to  be  dominate  in  all  the
channels of the body and the senses such as  seeing  and  hearing;  then  an
accurate perception of reality as it  is   naturally  occurs.  Lord  Krishna
confirms that this is indicative that <i>sattva guna</i> or the  mode  of  goodness
is predominant.
