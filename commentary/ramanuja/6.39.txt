Even one who has not embarked upon it but is merely enquiring about <i>yoga</i>  or
the science of the individual consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness , such a person resumes such inquiries in their  very
next birth that they had discontinued in their previous lifetime.  Gradually
one advances  on the  path  of  <i>yoga</i>  and  transcends  <i>sabda-brahma</i>  or  the
fruitive ordinances of the Vedic scriptures. <i>Sabda-brahma</i>  signifies  matter
and from this matter in its manifested modifications comes  <i>sabdita</i>  or  all
things having namea and forms such humans,  demigods,  earth,  sky,  heaven,
etc. Hence all things nameable and all  things  of  matter.  Even  the  mere
inquirer about <i>yoga</i> acquires enough merit  to  ultimately  transcend  beyond
the <i>sabda-brahma.</i> This means one becomes  unfettered  from  the  bondage  of
material existence and attains <i>atma-tattva</i> or realisation of the soul  which
is the sole harbour of spiritual intelligence and unlimited  bliss  or  that
which cannot be defined by a name as material objects which are composed  of
matter such as demigod or human etc.
