That <i>sukham</i> or happiness which enthrals the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being  both  at
the beginning and as well at the end even  after  the  habitual,  repetitive
experience exhibits its true nature of enslavement and  bondage  to  <i>samsara</i>
the perpetual cycle of birth and death is affirmed by Lord Krishna  as  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of ignorance. The word  <i>mohanam</i>  means  delusion  and  is  the
obscuration of  the  true  nature  of  reality.  <i>Nidra</i>  or  slumber  denotes
unconsciousness which can  transpire  even  while  engaging  in  an  act  of
enjoyment.  <i>Alasya</i>  is  slothfulness,  the  lassitude   which   comes   from
habitually dulled senses and which  certainly  contributes  to  dullness  of
mind. <i>Pramada</i> is inattention  to  what  is  required  and  is  connected  to
dullness of mind. So the delusive nature of <i>nidra, alasya</i>  and  <i>pramada</i>  are
all situated firmly in <i>tama guna</i> and along with the characteristics of  <i>raja</i>
<i>guna</i> are very detrimental to the aspiring <i>jiva.</i>
