In respect of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature  being  <i>sattva</i>  or
goodness, <i>rajas</i> or passion and  <i>tamas</i>  or  ignorance.  That  person  who  is
blinded by false  ego  and  bewildered  by  material  nature  believes  they
themselves are the root cause and sole determining factor  of   all  actions
they engage in. In the previous verse the word <i>ahankara</i> means bewildered  by
ego identification or misidentifying the body to be the <i>atma</i> or  soul.  Such
a person is situated in nescience thinking  that  the  interactions  of  the
three gunas in the physical body are the actions of the  <i>atma,</i>  such  a  one
foolishly considers that they are the doer of their actions. But the <i>tattva-</i>
<i>vit</i> or knower of the truth is competent in discerning in all activities  the
properties and influences of the three <i>gunas</i>  as  they  manifest  themselves
through  one's  actions.  Whoever  becomes  proficient  in  discerning   the
manifestation of the three <i>gunas</i> in all actions will not  commit  the  error
of thinking that they through their body are the doer.
