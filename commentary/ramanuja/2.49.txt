Those whose activities are inherently protected under  the  secure  guidance
of spiritual intelligence  are  released  from  the  bondage  of  continuous
rebirth in the material existence. Hence  one  should  undeviatingly  remain
steadfast  in  spiritual  intelligence.   Although   cultivating   spiritual
intelligence indeed takes enormous effort to achieve, once attained  is  not
difficult to maintain. All actions performed from the platform of  spiritual
intelligence are not binding and  the  mind  is  preserved  in  a  perfectly
equipoised state which can be compared to a state of  a  blissful  a  genius
sometimes experiences which is very wonderful.
