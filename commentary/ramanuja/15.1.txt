In the previous chapter the Supreme Lord Krishna expounded upon:
1) The <i>jiva</i> or embodied beings  relationship  with  matter  in  both  its
subtle and  physical  forms  due  to  attraction  to  sense  objects  and
subsequent attachment and the <i>karma</i> or reactions  to  one's  own  actions
thereof along with the <i>karma</i>  from  the  types  of  food  one  has  eaten
determines the physical body one receives in the next life.
2) The manner in detail how the association with the three <i>gunas</i> or modes
of material nature keeps a <i>jiva</i> enslaved in material existence  is  given
in verses 6 to 25.
3) The method by which a <i>jiva</i> is able to overcome and transcend the three
<i>gunas</i> and assume one's actual spiritual position of <i>atma tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation by <i>bhakti yoga</i> or exclusive loving devotion unto the  Supreme
Lord.

Now in this chapter the  most  worshippable  and  resplendent  Lord  Krishna
reveals His absolute dominion and sovereign  glory  over  all  creation  and
everything that is in it. Creation is constituted  by  <i>kshara</i>  or  transient
souls in bondage and <i>aksara</i> or eternally liberated souls.  Both  <i>kshara</i>  and
<i>akshara</i>  constitute  His  spiritual  form  which  constitutes   the   cosmic
manifestation but He is inconceivably distinctly different  from  both.  The
Supreme Lord being the Supreme creator and controller of all, the source  of
all  glorious  attributes  and  wonderful  qualities  is   a   fountain   of
righteousness and the antithesis of all that is evil and demoniac.  For  the
elucidation of this eternal truth the Supreme Lord  cites  the  <i>Asvattha</i>  or
banyan tree as a metaphor to  symbolise  the  material  manifestation  as  a
place of bondage and enslavement for the <i>atmas</i> or immortal souls trapped  as
a <i>jiva</i> in <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of  birth  and  death<i>.</i>  How  <i>kshara</i>
souls may escape from <i>samsara</i> and become the <i>akshara</i> souls is  His  glorious
plan of evolution and  it  is  enacted  by  the  sword  of  knowledge  which
destroys the tree of materialism by the weapon of non-attachment.

The state of <i>samsara</i> is symbolised by the <i>asvattha</i> or banyan tree  which  in
real ilfe has its roots growing upwards and its branches growing  downwards.
The indestructible nature of  <i>samsara</i> is symbolised in the  second  division
of  the Katha Upanisad III.I beginning <i>urdhva mulo avak shakha</i> which  means:
With  roots  upwards  and  branches  downwards   this   primeval   tree   is
everlasting. With roots upwards refers to our Brahma with  four  faces,  the
secondary creator who is situated above the seven worlds  of  Bhur,  Bhuvah,
Svah, Mahah, etc.. The branches downwards  refer  to  all  the  denziens  of
creation in the form of humans, animals, birds, fish, plants, insects,  etc.
The indestructible nature of this tree  is  due  to  its  being  <i>avyayan</i>  or
everlasting like a river with no end and because as a tree it is  impossible
to  uproot until  one  is  weaned  from  sense  gratification  and  material
desires by the mercy of  the  Supreme  Lords  devotee  and  <i>atma  tattva</i>  is
achieved by His His grace. The word <i>chandamsi</i>   refers  to  the  injunctions
and prohibitions of the Vedic scriptures which are symbolised by the  leaves
which flourish or dwindle in proportion to the <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  to  the
actions one accrues by adhering to or ignoring such provisions.  Leaves  are
very  instrumental  in  preserving  the  longevity  of  trees.  Whoever   is
knowledgeable  of  this  tree  as  just  explained  comprehends  the   Vedic
scriptures as the knowledge of non-attachment  is  the  ways  and  means  of
uprooting this tree and allows one to achieve <i>atma tattva.</i>
