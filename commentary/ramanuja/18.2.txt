Some learned philosophers contend  that  <i>sannyasa</i>  or  renunciation  is  the
abstention from  performing  activities  for  rewards.  Other  sophisticated
sages assert that in sections of the Vedic scriptures  pertaining  to  <i>moksa</i>
or liberation from material  existence  that  <i>tyaja</i>  or  renunciation  means
abandoning the  rewards  attached  to  Vedic  activities  whether  they  are
<i>namittika</i> or regular duties or <i>kamya</i> or specific activities  prescribed  for
specific results. The contention here is the  predominance  of  one  or  the
other points of view when in contradiction. Is <i>sannyasa</i>  or  abandonment  of
the activities for rewards alone sufficient or is <i>tyaja</i> the  abandonment  of
desires for rewards the essential attribute to be embraced?  Both appear  to
be plausible and both are situated in renunciation  and  both  may  be  used
synonymously and considered as renunciation. More  clarity  concerning  this
topic is presented by Lord Krishna in verses four, seven and twelve.
