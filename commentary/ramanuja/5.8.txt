One who has realised the nature of the <i>atma</i> or soul knows  the  true  nature
of reality. Such a person reflects that through  the  senses  of  perception
such as eyes and ears, the senses of action such as the  voice,  the  <i>pranas</i>
or life breaths, the physical body  functions  with  all  its  corresponding
objects; but factually I am separate as  an  individual  consciousness  from
all these activities and virtually do not  do  any  of  these  actions.  The
conception of doership is derived from  contact  with  the  senses  which  a
living entity is coerced to accept from time immemorial due to past  actions
in past lives. But this doership is not an essential attribute of  the  <i>atma</i>
and thus it is not necessary to accept. So I shall not accept  it  as  being
my essential  nature.  Thus  does  one  situated  in  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation reflect.
