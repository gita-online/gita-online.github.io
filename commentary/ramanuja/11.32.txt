Lord Krishna confirms that Drona,  Bhishma,  Karna  along  with  innumerable
warriors have already been slain by Him so Arjuna  should  not  hesitate  or
feel  remorse  for  slaying  his  enemies  be  they  superiors,  preceptors,
relatives or friends  in  battle  for  they  fighting  for  the  unrighteous
Duryodhana have already been marked for  destruction  by  Lord  Krishna.  In
this verse Arjuna is assured of victory over his enemies on the  battlefield
and he should not feel even the slightest doubt about this or  think  he  is
performing sins by slaying his enemies.
