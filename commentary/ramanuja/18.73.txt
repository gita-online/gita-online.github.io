The  phrase  <i>rupam  atyadbhutam</i>  refers  to  the  phenomenal  <i>visvarupa</i>   or
universal form exhibited  by  Lord  Krishna  on  the  battlefield  that  was
described in chapter 11 which Sanjaya had observed in  astonishment  by  the
power of his celestial vision. The  more  he  remembered  this  amazing  and
astonishing <i>visvarupa</i> the more rapturous  and  ecstatic  he  became  by  its
transcendental  magnificence.  Marvelling  in   wondrous   ecstasy   he   is
incessantly inundated by waves of rapture.
