Whosoever understands Lord Krishna as being the origin of  all  as  well  as
being transcendental to all will cease to entangle themselves  with  desires
and attachments to rewards which results in acquiring <i>karma</i> or reactions  to
actions which binds one to <i>samsara</i> or the cycle of birth and  death.  It  is
from past <i>karmas</i> that one is existing in their  present  lifetime  position.
Such a person possessing such knowledge and acting upon it appropriately  as
described in these verses will no longer be bound by <i>karma.</i>
