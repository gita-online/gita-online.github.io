Here the Supreme Lord Krishna gives Arjuna another reason not to lament  for
He states that even if one considers the eternal soul to be the same as  the
physical body which is subject to incessant births  and  deaths  and  not  a
separate and distinct reality;  then  still  there  is  no  need  for  grief
because  from birth the ageing of the physical body due to  the  passage  of
time leads to death and birth and death is a law of nature in  the  material
existence and unavoidable.
