Likewise from the seventh chapter till the end of chapter ten, Lord  Krishna
has revealed the reality of the emanating of all beings from Him as well  as
the influx  of  all  beings  back  into  Himself.  The  word  <i>avyayam</i>  means
imperishable and <i>mahatmyam</i> means the majesty and greatness of being  neutral
to all things sentient and insentient although being their  source,  due  to
complete omniscience, omnipotence  and  omnipresence  along  with  unlimited
<i>vibhuti</i> or  divine  transcendental  opulence  as  the  controller  of  every
breath, every thought and every action being the foundation  of  everything.
The word <i>hi</i> meaning certainly is an adverb  indicative  of  the  forthcoming
vision of Lord Krishna's universal form.
