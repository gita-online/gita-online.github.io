The Supreme Lord Krishna is  known  as  <i>isvara</i>  is  residing  <i>saman</i>  equally
<i>sarvatra</i> within all beings. This includes demigods,  humans,  animals,  etc.
The word <i>pasyati</i> here meaning perceives denotes that the  <i>atma</i>  or  immortal
soul is recognised wherever it may abide. By thus comprehending  the  actual
nature of the <i>atma</i> one  never  degrades  themselves  and  <i>na  hinasti</i>  never
causes harm to oneself. Contrarily if one insists on  identifying  the  <i>atma</i>
in the same way as  the  physical  body  in  the  differentiating  light  of
unlimited bodily forms one injures and degrades  their  eternal  self.  This
understanding saves one from acquiring <i>karma</i> or reactions to  actions  which
is the main cause of confinement to <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual cycle of  birth
and death. By gaining this basic realisation one achieves the goal of  <i>atma-</i>
<i>tattva</i> or soul realisation and then becomes eligible  for  <i>param  gatim</i>  the
supreme destination and highest attainment.
