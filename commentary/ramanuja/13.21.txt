Lord Krishna states <i>yavat  kincit</i>  whatsoever  meaning  anything  mobile  or
immobile regardless of how grandiose or infinitesimal that  is  existing  in
any dimension of creation is the mutual combination of  matter  and  spirit.
It is always a compound existence with interdependence upon each  other  and
never independence from each other.
