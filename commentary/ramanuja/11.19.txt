The words <i>dyae aprthivyor</i> meaning heaven and Earth  denotes  all  the  upper
and lower planetary systems  throughout  material  existence  and  the  word
<i>antaram</i> is all space between them all. So in all  spaces  wherein  universes
revolve and in all spaces  and  every  direction  the  <i>visvarupa</i>  or  divine
universal form of Lord Krishna could be  seen  pervading  indefinitely.  The
phenomenal  pervasion  of  the  <i>visvarupa</i>  of  infinite   nature   made   it
irresistibly awe-inspiring and its omnipotence was terrible to  behold.  All
the three planetary systems such as those inhabited by Brahma, by the  <i>Devas</i>
or demigods,  by  the  <i>Siddhas</i>  or  perfected  beings,  by  the  <i>Pitri's</i>  or
ancestors, by the <i>Gandharvas</i>  or  celestial  singers,  by  the  <i>Raksasas</i>  or
demons, etc. all were assembled in the air above Kuruksetra to  witness  the
impending battle between the Pandavas and  the  Kauravas.  The  words  <i>maha-</i>
<i>atman</i> meaning great soul denotes the Supreme Lord being  the  greatest  soul
comprised of all souls. The three planetary  systems  are  distinguished  as
being inhabited by  compassionate  beings  like  Brahma  and  the  demigods,
inimical beings like the demons, and neutral beings like the ancestors.  The
word <i>pravyathitam</i> means greatly fearful and panic struck.

The same divine vision that Arjuna was given was  also  bequeathed  at  that
time in general to all beings and those who were evolved and competent  were
also  able  to  directly  perceive  Lord  Krishna's  <i>visvarupa</i>  in  all  its
magnificent and terrible splendor. If one were to perhaps wonder  why  would
this possibly be so, the answer is that  it  confirms  the  reality  of  the
<i>visvarupa</i>  from  a  variety  of  sources  and  it  irrevocably  proves   the
indomitable power of Lord Krishna's transcendental potency which applies  to
all living entities.
