Those blessed <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings who have relinquished such  illusions
as love for things not related to the <i>atma</i> or immortal soul attain unto  the
Supreme Lord Krishna as their saviour. The evils of  desire  and  attachment
captivates one  by sense gratification  bewilderd  by  the  three  <i>gunas</i>  or
modes of material nature. Those that surmount this are:
<i>1) nirmana mohan</i> means free from pride and false ego conception of  being
their body
<i>2) adhyatma-nityah</i> means those engrossed in the eternal knowledge of  the
<i>atma</i>
<i>3) vinivrtta-kamah</i> means totally free from lusty desires by only desiring
the <i>atma</i>
<i>4) vimukta dvandvair</i>  means  completely  liberated  from  conceptions  of
dualities
Those that achieve the above attain <i>avyayam padam</i>  or  the  eternal  supreme
transcendental state by <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation of the immortal soul  and
its  unlimited  intelligence  characterised  by   it   infinitely   expanded
consciousness.
<p>
To those whose faith in the Supreme Lord Krishna is bonafide  by  acceptance
of a spiritual guru in authorised disciplic succession  and  whose  devotion
is absolute due  to   the  mercy  of  the  spiritual  master  and  receiving
knowledge of <i>bhakti</i> or exclusive loving devotion  unto  the   Supreme  Lord.
Then  Lord  Krishna  Himself  initiates  the   previously   mentioned   four
attributes and their success is effected solely by  His  grace.   Then  they
are all easily traversed until perfection comes and the goal is reached.
