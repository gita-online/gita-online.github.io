This  reality  has  already  been  evidenced  in  verses  throughout  Srimad
Bhagavad-Gita like:
In chapter 5, verse 29:  One  who  understands  that  Lord  Krishna  is  the
supreme controller of all achieves liberation. In chapter 7, verse  6:  Lord
Krishna is the sole cause of creation and destruction of all  existence  and
in verse 7: There is nothing superior  to  Lord  Krishna.  All  creation  is
dependent upon Him. In chapter 10 verse 3: One who  knows  Lord  Krishna  is
the supreme controller of all the worlds is not deluded  among  mortals  and
in verse 8: The wise know that Lord  Krishna  is  the  source  of  both  the
material and the spiritual worlds. In chapter 15 verse 15: Lord  Krishna  is
the supreme soul within the heart of all living entities by the Vedas  alone
He is to be known and coming in  chapter  18  verse  46:  As  everything  is
pervaded by Him, one attains perfection  from  performing  prescribed  Vedic
activities to Lord Krishna. In this way this topic has been well  evidenced.
