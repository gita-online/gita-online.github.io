Lord Krishna is  explaining  that  whatever  is  existing  in  all  creation
possessing the characteristics of the three <i>gunas</i> or modes being  <i>sattva</i>  or
goodness, <i>rajas</i> or passion  and  <i>tamas</i>  or  nescience  which  combines  into
bodies and senses and objects for enjoyment comes from <i>prakriti</i> or  material
nature all emanate solely from the Supreme Lord. Constituting  His  body  as
they do, they all eternally reside within Him; but <i>na tv aham  tesu</i>  meaning
He is not in them. However regarding all other  sentient  beings  throughout
creation the <i>atma</i> or soul is seen to depend upon the physical body  for  its
residence but without a soul the vitality is  deactivated  in  the  physical
body and it will perish. But the Supreme Lord possessing  a  transcendental,
spiritual body which is not material does not depend  upon  physicality.  He
is totally independent and although He has ordered things in such a  way  as
to reside in all sentient beings it is for no other purpose  then  His  <i>lila</i>
or pastime.
