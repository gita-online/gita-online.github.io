That the mind is difficult to control and  direct  due  to  its  fickle  and
tempestuous nature is a fact unable to deny. But the possibility  of  taming
it  depends  upon  generating  in  the  mind  a  feeling  of  affection  and
attachment by accustoming the mind to  regularly  reflect  on  the  sublime,
transcendental qualities of the <i>atma</i> or soul and then  meditating  upon  the
<i>atma</i> daily. In this way very  soon  an  aversion  will  arise  to  focus  on
anything that does not facilitate <i>atma tattva</i> or realisation  of  the  soul.
This  will  happen  naturally  when  the  discerning   mind  perceives   the
imperfections inherent in all other topics and  subjects.  Lord  Krishna  is
reiterating that for one who has not subjugated their mind this <i>yoga</i> or  the
science  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness by <i>dhyana</i> or meditation  is  extremely  difficult  to
realise; but it is possible  to  achieve  by  one  who  has  the  vision  of
equanimity towards all beings and  understands  that  the  same  fundamental
spiritual basis is present everywhere as the <i>atma</i>  existing  in  all  living
entities. Controlling the mind has already been elucidated by  Lord  Krishna
in the process of selfless  <i>karma  yoga</i>  as  offerings  of  worship  to  the
Supreme Lord. Lord Krishna has  also  instructed  in  chapter  II.XXXX  that
there is no loss or diminution by the performance  of  this  <i>yoga;</i>  but  the
greatness of <i>karma yoga</i> there described is  certainly  that  which  embodies
<i>atma tattva</i> and culminates in communion with <i>paramatma</i> the Supreme  Soul  by
meditation.
