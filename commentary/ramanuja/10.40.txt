Lord Krishna now informs that whatever has been  confirmed  as  the  reality
regarding His  <i>vibhuti</i>  or  divine,  transcendental  opulence  is  extremely
minimal. In whatever condition the material creation may appear, be  it  the
absolute reality of the supra subtle unmanifest state of the  <i>brahman</i>  being
the spiritual substratum pervading all  existence  or  be  it  the  relative
reality of the supra gross manifest  state  possessing  the  five  elements.
Whether existing temporarily or in perpetuity, the total creation  comprised
of <i>cit</i>  or  consciousness  and  <i>acit</i>  or  unconscious  beings,  objects  and
substances are structured in such a way as to not conflict with  each  other
and never to go contrary  against  the  Supreme  Lord's  will.  The  blessed
Parasara the father of Vedavyasa revealed in  the  Vishnu  Purana  that  the
whole creation is maintained by 1<i>10,000  part  of  1</i>10,000  part  of  Lord
Krishna's inconceivable power.
