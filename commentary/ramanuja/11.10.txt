Sanjaya  who  could  visually  see  everything  that   transpired   on   the
battlefield by the grace of Vedavyasa, uses the word <i>divya</i>  meaning  divine,
to show the resplendent and celestial quality of everything associated  with
the Supreme Lord Krishna. The word <i>anantam</i>  means  unlimited  denoting  that
the <i>visvarupa</i> or divine universal form is the refuge for all  creation  from
the past, in the present and into the future and not  subject  to  time  and
space. The words <i>visvato-mukham</i> means many faces in every direction. So  the
<i>visvarupa</i>  is  exhibited  with  the  appropriate  divine   weapons,   divine
ornaments and divine apparel.
