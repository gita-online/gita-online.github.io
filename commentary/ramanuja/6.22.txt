A peaceful mind means a mind immovably situated  in  constant  mediation  on
the <i>atma</i> or soul. Once this is accomplished it is  quite  natural  that  the
<i>yogi</i>  or  one  perfecting  the  science  of  the  individual   consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate consciousness by <i>dhyana</i> or  meditation
soon has all blemishes and sins completely purged. The  words  <i>santa-rajasam</i>
means the quality of  <i>rajas</i> or passion has become <i>santa</i> or  peaceful.  Hence
one  becomes  imbued  with  the  qualities  of  the  <i>Brahmam</i>  or   spiritual
substratum pervading all existence and which also refers to the <i>atma</i> and re-
establishs one into their true essence of spiritual  splendour.  To  such  a
<i>yogi</i> comes <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  realisation  of  the  soul  and  exquisite  and
phenomenal transcendental  felicity.  The  word  used  by  Lord  Krishna  <i>hi</i>
meaning verily, is an indeclinable particle which gives  a  reason  denoting
that by the reason of  <i>atma  tattva</i>  being  essentially  blissful  the  <i>yogi</i>
becomes blissful as well.
