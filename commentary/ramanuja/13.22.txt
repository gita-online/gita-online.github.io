Lord  Krishna  confirms  with  the  words  <i>pasyati</i>  meaning   perceives   or
discriminates that one who realises  that  <i>paramatma</i>  or  the  Supreme  Soul
existing equally within all <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings  is  the  <i>ksetrajna</i>  or
knower of the sphere of activity and that  it  is  distinctly  distinguished
from <i>prakriti</i> the material substratum  pervading  physical  existence  which
manifests as unlimited forms such as demigod, human, animal, etc.  In  other
words  recognising  the  Supreme  Lord  as  the  same  omnipresent   eternal
consciousness localised within each and every living  entity  and  realising
that it is singular. Also distinguishing the fact that  while  all  physical
bodies decay and perish; the <i>atma</i> or individual immortal soul does not  ever
decay or perish because it has an eternal, transcendental  nature.  This  is
confirmed  in  the  Vishnu   Purana:   VI.VII.LVIII   beginning   <i>pradhanadi</i>
<i>viseshantam</i> meaning: the undecaying within the decaying.  One who  correctly
comprehends the <i>atma</i> in this manner properly perceives reality. But one  who
thinks that the  <i>atma</i>  is  subject  to  birth  and  death  and  that  it  is
modifiable and variable like the forms of living entities which  are  always
changing; then such a person will always remained  confined  in  <i>samsara</i>  or
the perpetual cycle of birth and death in material existence.
