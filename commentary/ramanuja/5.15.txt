Although the intelligence may be shrouded by the veil of ignorance still  it
has been seen that there are  those  whose  consciousness  becomes  awakened
upon receiving Vedic knowledge.   The  veil  of  ignorance  is  due  to  the
endless mass of accumulated  reactions  to  previous  actions  in  incessant
lifetimes since time immemorial. <i>Atma tattva</i> or realisation of the soul  and
soul related knowledge derived from the Vedic scriptures  and  imbibed  from
the teachings of the spiritual master increases virtue and quality in  one's
daily life and is exceedingly pure. For this  it  is  necessary  to  achieve
innate  extraordinary  intelligence  or  supra-consciousness  which  becomes
resplendent like the sun unlimited and expansive,  illuminating  all  things
by the reality of their exact nature. The word <i>jnanam</i> meaning  by  knowledge
and <i>atmanah</i> denoting plurality of souls confirms that by such knowledge  one
realises the Supreme Being.  It should not be contended that  the  plurality
of unlimited <i>atmas</i> is <i>upadhi</i> or limited because no trace of  limitation  can
exist once one's ignorance has been dispelled by  <i>atma  tattva.</i>    Spiritual
intelligence in  itself  is  an  attribute  of  one  who  possesses  and  is
dependent upon existence. The <i>atma</i> which is eternal is not an attribute  and
is independent in relation to existence.  The  analogy  of  the  sun  as  an
illuminator is to illustrate the relation between cognisance  and  cognition
or the relationship between the knower and the known shown  by  the  sun  as
the source of light and emanation of light. Hence it can be  discerned  that
in <i>samsara</i> or the endless cycle of birth and death in the conditioned  state
there is extreme limitation due to <i>karma</i> or  reactions  to  actions  and  in
<i>moksa</i> or the emancipated state there is an absence of limitation  due  to  a
lack of <i>karma.</i>.
