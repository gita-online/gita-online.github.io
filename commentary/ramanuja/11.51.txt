Only by bhakti or exclusive loving devotion can the Supreme Lord Krishna be
known as He really is. Study of the Vedas, meditation, performance of
rituals, extreme austerities etc. are of no avail in perceiving Lord
Krishna as paramatma or the Supreme Soul within all living entities and
realising Him as He is. But by bhakti Lord Krishna is easy to be known
through the grace of the spiritual master who teaches the true purport of
the Vedic scriptures which  all relate to Lord Krishna. Only by bhakti is
it possible to have communion with the Supreme Lord Krishna as the actual
experience of atma-tattva or soul realisation which activates one's divine
relationship with Him. The Katha Upanisad II.XXIII beginning nas yam atma
prachanna meaning not by reflection, nor deliberation, nor concentration
can Lord Krishna be attained. He can only be attained by one who He,
Himself specially elects and blesses to reveal His essence to.
