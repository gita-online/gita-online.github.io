One who is interested in qualifying for <i>jnana yoga</i>  or  the  cultivation  of
Vedic knowledge must restrain the natural out going  tendency  of  the  five
senses from pursuing sense objects.  But  the  mighty  enemy  <i>kama</i>  or  lust
covertly causes dissent in the enquiring of <i>atma tattva</i>  or  realisation  of
the soul and contrarily causes enthusiasm for procuring the delights of  the
senses. One understanding that the  senses  operate  in  their  own  natural
sphere within the physical body<i>,</i> directs them  to  perform  the  appropriate
occupational duties according to ones rank and  station  in  life  in  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> or the performance of prescribed Vedic activities and thus  the  senses
are constrained.  Lord Krishna thus gives the key to vanquishing this  great
enemy known as <i>kama</i> which is so terrible and which destroys  both  <i>jnana</i>  or
spiritual knowledge and <i>vijnana</i> or spiritual wisdom.
