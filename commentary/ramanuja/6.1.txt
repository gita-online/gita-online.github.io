<i>Karma yoga</i> or the performance of prescribed Vedic  activities  and  all  its
separate constituents has so far been expounded by Lord Krishna as  well  as
<i>jnana yoga</i> or the  cultivation  of  Vedic  knowledge.  Now  the  method  for
practicing  <i>yoga</i> or the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining
communion with the ultimate consciousness while being in  renunciation  will
be explained by means of meditation to achieve <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  realisation
of the soul. This verse is a brief reassertion  of  what  has  already  been
previously stated that <i>karma yoga</i> unaided has the  capability  of  bestowing
<i>atma tattva</i> and that within the performance of <i>atma tattva</i>  is  the  special
quality of renunciation and that <i>karma yoga</i> in its  mature  stage  also  has
for its goal meditation which precedes <i>atma tattva.</i>
<p>
Whosoever performs <i>karma yoga</i> without  hankering  for  rewards  or  desiring
results, performing all activities  as  a  matter  of  duty  with  no  other
conception except that it is a humble service rendered to the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna who in every way  is  the  best  well  wisher  and  dearest  friend.
Whether one is a <i>sannyasi</i> or celibate brahmin in the renounced  order  or  a
performer of <i>jnana yoga</i>  or <i>karma yoga</i> such a person  may  be  considered  a
renunciate following the path to <i>atma tattva.</i> Its not  that  a  <i>sannyasi</i>  is
one that simply abstains from activities such as <i>agnihotra</i> or offering  <i>ghee</i>
or clarified butter and food grains into the  fire.  Nor  is  one  renounced
merely because  they  do  not  perform  activities  enjoined  in  the  Vedic
scriptures. One is renounced who engages in prescribed Vedic  activities  at
the  same  time  abandoning  desire  for  rewards   while   fulfilling   the
requirements of action  and  renunciation.  The  next  verse  describes  how
within <i>karma yoga</i> there is found renunciation as well.
