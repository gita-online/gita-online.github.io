The Vrishni lineage descends from King Yayati and Queen Devayani from  which
Vasudeva is the sixth generation of descendants. Lord Krishna's  <i>vibhuti</i>  or
divine, transcendental opulence cannot be referring to Himself  as  the  son
of Vasudeva because He is describing His <i>vibhuti.</i>  The  only  other  son  of
Vasudeva is Balarama who is Lord Krishna's first   expansion  and  manifests
every incarnation including Vishnu. So Balarama is the <i>vibhuti</i>  referred  to
here. Of sages or those who have realised the ultimate truth His <i>vibhuti</i>  is
Vedavyasa. <i>Kavayah</i> are those seers who are omniscient.
