Lord Krishna affirms that although He enters  <i>prakriti</i>  or  material  nature
which is under His complete control, by  His  own  sweet  will  through  His
internal potency known as <i>yogamaya.</i> He is  never  divested  of  His  supreme
transcendental attributes and imperishable potencies as  Sovereign  Lord  of
all creation even though His external from  appears  human.  The  forms  and
places where the Supreme Lord resides as described in the Vedic scriptures.
1) He the spirit who luminously resides in the interior of the sun
2) He the spirit who luminously resides in the etheric region of the heart
3) He who is immortal and eternal
4) He who manifested all the demigods and humans
5) He who is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
6) He who is resplendent and all pervasive
7) He who is transcendental to <i>prakriti</i> or material nature.
8) He who by His omniscience knows the actions and qualities of all beings

The  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  assumes  forms  suitable  to  time,  place  and
circumstances in regards to celestial being  the  demigods  and  terrestrial
being humans. He manifests himself as if He were of their  nature  according
to His desire. Being unborn He yet incarnates in  many  forms  whenever  and
wherever He chooses whereas for material beings  they  are  forcefully  born
impelled by their <i>karma</i>  or  the  bondage  caused  from  reactions  to  past
actions. Next the time of manifestation  for  the  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations
will be indicated.
