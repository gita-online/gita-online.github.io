In chapter sixteen  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  delineated  the  difference
between those endowed with  the  divine  nature  and  those  possessing  the
demoniac nature. The conclusion of that chapter is that the  absolute  truth
and highest benefit for all creation as  well  as  the  means  by  which  to
attain communion with the ultimate reality of  the  Supreme  Lord  is  based
exclusively on the authority of the Vedic scriptures and no other source.
<p>
In this  chapter  it  will  be  illustrated  that  activities  performed  in
contradiction to the Vedic scriptures actually oppose  the  divine  will  of
creation and  prove  to  be  destabilising  and  destructive.  The  question
involved is  not  concerned  with  contradictory  activities.  The  question
refers to religious activities performed  not  contradictory  to  the  Vedic
scriptures whether in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness<i>, raja guna</i>  the  mode
of passion or <i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance corresponding  to  the  intent
and motive and if they are performed with faith what is  the  difference  in
results. If one is indifferent or not knowledgeable about  the  veracity  of
the paramount position of the Vedic scriptures  and  performs  instead  with
faith the traditional rituals that one was born into, does that   constitute
<i>sattva guna, raja guna</i> or <i>tama guna</i> and what are the results.
<p>
Questioned in this manner Lord Krishna  refrains  from  speaking  about  the
utter futility of performing any activity contrary to Vedic scriptures  even
with faith and immediately expounds  upon  the  relationship  of  the  three
<i>gunas</i> or modes of material nature<i>.</i>
