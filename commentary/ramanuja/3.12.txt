The words <i>yagna-bhavitah</i> means honoured by worship. The worship of  pleasing
the demi-gods in which Lord Krishna also resides as the <i>atma</i>  or  soul  will
confer on those whose perform it  whatever  prosperity  and  abundance  they
have prayed for. This means that by receiving these things as  such  one  is
able  to  worship  the  demi-gods  and  receive  from  them  perpetually  by
offerings and worship to them with regularity.
<p>
But if one should try to enjoy the  gifts  granted  by  them  without  first
offering  them  back  beforehand  then  such  a  person  is  a   thief   for
misappropriating  what  was  not  sanctioned  by  the  act   of   <i>yagna</i>   or
appeasement. <i>Stena eva sah</i> means one is certainly a thief. A  thief  is  one
who executes <i>chaurya</i> or larceny. The definition of larceny is the  intention
of or act of one to misappropriate property  for  oneself  for  the  use  of
which they have no right which factually  belongs to others.
<p>
Thus to  one  of  this  nature  and  this  description  there  is  not  only
forfeiture and exemption from <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the  cycle  of  birth
and death but there will also be suffering for these sins  in  the  infernal
regions of the hellish planets described in Canto V of the Bhagavat  Purana.
This same subject is further explained in the next verse .
