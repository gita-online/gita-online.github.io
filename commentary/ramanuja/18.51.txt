The word <i>abhijanati</i> means really knowing Lord Krishna. Perceiving who He  is
in  essence  by  His  essential  attributes  which  manifests  as   glorious
qualities of all creation. It is by  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive  loving  devotion
unto the Supreme Lord Krishna which constitutes the eternal  nature  of  the
<i>atma</i> or immortal soul which subjectively initiates the quest to realise  the
Supreme Lord life after life until success  is  achieved  by  His  discovery
within the etheric  heart  of  the  <i>atma</i>  from  whence  communion  with  Him
commences. This knowledge of discovering the Supreme Lord  consists  of  the
<i>atma</i> envisioning Lord Krishna as He eternally is with a  sparkling  blackish
complexion, two armed,  dressed  in  golden  cloth,  bedecked  with  peacock
feather, glorified by gunga mala, smiling charmingly while holding  a  flute
to His lips. This vision is His original and  eternal  form  and  is  rarely
seen by <i>even</i> liberated <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings. More commonly seen  is  His
four armed expansion as <i>Ksirodakasayi Vishnu</i> who  resides  in  every  living
entity individually in the abode of the etheric heart of  all  <i>jivas.</i>  Still
others may envision any  of  His  <i>avatars</i>  or  incarnations  and  expansions
revealed in Vedic scriptures that they are surrendered to such  as  Rama  or
Narasinghadeva or even the <i>visvarupa</i> or universal form described in  chapter
11. Once the vision has been obtained  by  intense  love  and  devotion  one
attains communion with that very form of the Supreme Lord Krishna  that  one
dedicated their life to. is devoted to and immediately is borne aloft to  by
such intense love and devotion. The word <i>tatah</i> refers to <i>bhakti</i> as the  sole
cause and means which verily constitutes the only way in reality  to  effect
communion  and  attainment  to  the  Supreme  Lord.  This  was  clearly  and
equivocally  stated  in  chapter  11,  verse   54   beginning   <i>bhaktya   tv</i>
<i>ananyaya</i> meaning: That only by exclusive, loving devotion the  Supreme  Lord
can be known.

The fruition of <i>naimittika</i> or daily prescribed Vedic activities as  well  as
<i>nitya</i>  or  occasional  prescribed  Vedic  activities  with  renunciation  of
desires for rewards performing every activity as an offering to the  Supreme
Lord in worship has  been  concisely  elaborated.  That  the  same  fruition
accompanies activities of <i>kamya</i>  or  craving  when  performed  in  the  same
manner in relationship to the Supreme Lord will be confirmed next.
