By <i>bhakti</i> or loving  devotion  rendered  exclusively  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna for His  satisfaction  alone  without  any  thought  of  reward  one
becomes ecstatically transformed by such intense love and  by  this  one  is
firmly fixed in <i>sattva guna</i> the mode of goodness with  all  traces  of  <i>raja</i>
<i>guna</i> the mode of passion and <i>tama guna</i> the mode of ignorance rooted out.  In
this way one is <i>ksiprin</i> or speedily, divested of all  sinful  reactions  and
becomes <i>dharmatma</i> or a righteous soul, worthy of praise by all. Such is  the
position of one  who  becomes  an  unadulterated  devotee  of  Lord  Krishna
worshipping  Him  exclusively.  It  is  this  exclusive  devotion  that  was
referred to in verse three of this chapter with  the  word  <i>dharmasyasya</i>  or
pure eternal righteousness. A person performing <i>bhakti</i> goes to  the  sublime
eternal state of the spiritual worlds from whence  there  is  no  return.  A
state where all energy and effort contrary to  attaining  the  Supreme  Lord
ceases. Here Lord Krishna gives encouragement to Arjuna  to  boldly  declare
His statements with certitude that whoever is an  unadulterated  devotee  of
Lord Krishna  never perishes or is ever vanquished even if such  a  one  was
possessed in the past  with  a  demeaning  character  degraded  by  inimical
actions. The paramount virtue of  <i>bhakti</i>  or  loving  devotion  is  that  it
completely  destroys  anything  that  is  opposed  to  <i>bhakti</i>   and   having
eradicated all <i>karma</i> or reactions  to  previous  actions  one  achieves  the
eternal position of <i>moksa</i> or freedom from the material  existence  and  thus
such a devotee becomes irrevocably imbued with deep  and  lasting  love  and
devotion to the Supreme Lord.
