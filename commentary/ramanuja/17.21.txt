Lord Krishna elaborates the  ontology  of  OM  TAT  SAT  and  how  they  are
interrelated. The words <i>brahma-vadinam</i> are those who follow the  injunctions
and ordinances of the Vedic  scriptures  and  refers  to  the  three  higher
<i>varnas</i>  or  castes  beginning  with  the   brahmins   or   priestly   class,
<i>ksatriyas</i> the royal and warrior class and <i>vaisyas</i> the merchant class.  <i>Yagna</i>
or propitiation and worship to the Supreme  Lord  is  performed  exclusively
by the Vaisnavas and Brahmins. <i>Tapah</i> or  austerities  is  performed  by  the
Vaisnava brahmins and the <i>ksatriyas. Danam</i> or charity is  performed  by  the
<i>ksatriyas and vaisyas</i> and is offered to the Vaisnavas and  brahmanas  to  be
utilised for the service of the Supreme Lord Krishna or any of  His  <i>avatars</i>
or authorised incarnations and expansions  according  to  vedic  scriptures.
Thus the relationship between the three higher <i>varnas</i>  has  been  clarified.
All prescribed Vedic rituals must be performed exclusively by the  Vaisnavas
and brahmanas and always commence with the  transcendental  sound  vibration
OM. The Vedas begin with OM as well. Thus the eternal connection between  OM
and  the  Vedas  and  OM  and  <i>yagnas</i>  has  been  demonstrated  and   firmly
established as only in conjunction with the transcendental sound  of  OM  at
the commencement are the Vedas recited and  the  performance  of  <i>yagnas</i>  is
bonafide.
