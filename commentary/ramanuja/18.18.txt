Knowledge is understanding the action to be performed.  The  effort  is  the
means and method to perform the action and included with the  agent  as  the
performer of the action. The  phrase  <i>guna-sankhya</i>  refers  to  the  Sankhya
philosophy of analytical deduction by Lord Krishna's incarnation of  Kapila-
deva, which describes the characteristics of the three  <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of
material nature and their relationship to knowledge and agent  as  described
in the next three verses.
