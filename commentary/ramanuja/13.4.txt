The <i>tattva</i> or conclusive truth regarding the <i>ksetra</i> or  field  of  activity
being matter and the <i>ksetrajna</i> being the knower or witness within the  field
of activity have been variously described by the <i>rsis</i> or holy sages such  as
Parasara and Vasistha. In the Visnu Purana  II.XIII.  verse  LIXX  beginning
<i>aham tvancha</i> we find: O king of the Earth we  are  all  derived  of  the  24
elelments  by  which  embodied  being  en  masse  take  the   bodily   shape
corresponding to their attraction to the three <i>gunas</i> or  modes  of  material
nature. In verse LXX beginning <i>karma vasya guna</i> we find: Verily O  king  the
three gunas of <i>sattva</i> or goodness, <i>rajas</i> or passion and <i>tamas</i>  or  ignorance
are dependent solely upon <i>karma</i> or reactions to one's own actions which  are
all the consequence of <i>avidya</i> or the absence of knowledge which is  part  of
all creatures at birth. Yet in verse LXXI  beginning  <i>atma  suddho</i>  we  find
revealed:  That  the  immortal  soul  is  purely  spiritual,   imperishable,
sublime,  devoid  of  material  qualities  and  distinctly  different   from
<i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum pervading all physical existence.
<p>
Similarly the Visnu Purana II.XIII.IXC  beginning  <i>pindah  prithag</i>  meaning:
The physical body characterised by face, head, hands and body  is  different
from the embodied being then to which of these can one refer to as I or  me.
Again in II.XII.CII beginning <i>kim tvam etat chirah</i> meaning:   Art  thou  thy
head, or thy chest, or thy stomach or thy foot and the like O  king  or  are
thou thine?  And  in  II:XII.CIII  beginning  <i>samast  avayavebhyam</i>  meaning:
Distinct art thou O  king  from  all  thy  bodily  parts  and  being  clever
determine who is the I.
Both these examples postulate that matter the physical body and  the  spirit
soul are distinctly different from each other. Vasudeva meaning the  Supreme
Lord Krishna is eulogised in  innumerable  Vedic  scriptures  In  the  Visnu
Sahasra verse CXXXVII beginning  <i>indiyani  mano</i>  meaning:  The  senses,  the
manas, buddhi,  ego,  health,  strength  and  spirit  are  all  ensouled  by
Vasudeva, both the <i>ksetra</i> and <i>ksetrajna.</i>
<p>
Distinctly by various mantras of the Rig Veda, Yajur  Veda,  Sama  Veda  and
Atharva Veda the distinctions between the bodily nature  and  the  spiritual
soul nature are sublimely sung.
An example is found in the Tattiriya Upanisad II.I.II beginning  <i>tasmad  eva</i>
<i>etasmadatmana akasah sambhutah</i>  meaning:  From  the  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal  soul
verily <i>akasa</i> or space has manifested ,  from  space  ether  has  manifested,
from ether has come air, from air has come fire, from fire has  come  water,
from water has come earth, from earth has come plants, from plants has  come
food, from food comes all embodied species  headed  by  the  human  species.
Thus the nature of the physical body has been stated.  As  well  the  subtle
principle of <i>pranas</i> or life airs and the even subtler principle of <i>manas</i>  or
the mind and intellect  have  been  stated  in  conclusion.  More  than  the
principle of the <i>manas</i> is the supra-subtle principle of the <i>vijnana-maya</i>  or
the conscious soul and the source of all of the above is  the  Supreme  Lord
in His localised form as <i>paramatma</i> the  Supreme  Soul  within  all  sentient
beings and even more supra-subtle than even this is His transcendental  body
as the composite form of all <i>atmas</i> in all living entities known  as  <i>ananda-</i>
<i>maya</i> as given in the Tattiriya Upanisad  II.V.II  beginning:  <i>tasyaisha  eva</i>
<i>sharira atma</i> which is the witness and monitor of living entities.  
<p>
Categorically as well the distinct characteristics by which the  <i>ksetra  and</i>
<i>ksetrajna</i>  exist  and  their  manifestation  by  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence is revealed in many  places  in  the  Rig
Veda and the Atharva Veda.
<p>
Also the Vedanta Sutra verses reveal in its sublimely concise aphorisms  the
nature of the <i>brahman</i> and its relationship with  the  Supreme  Lord.  It  is
also called the <i>Sariraka Sutras</i>  because  of  its  conclusive  authoritative
judgement on these  esoteric topics.  For example in Vedanta Sutra  II.III.I
beginning <i>no viyadasruteh</i> meaning: The <i>akasha</i> or space  is  eternal  because
there is  no  Vedic  evidence  contrary  to  this  and  thus  all  decisions
regarding the nature of the <i>ksetra</i> are formulated also in this way.  Another
example is seen in II.III.XVIII beginning <i>utcrantigatyagatinam</i> meaning:  The
<i>jiva</i> or embodied soul is infinitesimal because the  Vedic  scriptures  state
that it goes out of an old body and returns to  a  new  body.  The  <i>atma</i>  or
eternal soul is  superlatively  conscious  and  such  a  reality  formulates
decisions regarding  the  <i>ksetrajna.</i>  But  in  verse  II.III.XXXX  beginning
<i>kritaprayatnapekshastu vihita pratisiddha</i> meaning: The Supreme  Lord  impels
all <i>jivas</i> to act in accordance with the nature and  tendency  of  their  own
self  enacted  previous  actions  and  effects.   Everything  is  under  the
complete control and total dominion of the Supreme  Lord  but  He  does  not
interfere with the freewill  of  the  <i>jiva</i>  although  He  is  certainly  the
supreme  soul  of  living  entities.  So  the   evidence   of   the   <i>ksetra</i>
and <i>ksetrajna</i> have been copiously expounded in various Vedic  scriptures  in
numerous ways but now Lord Krishna will describe the same  in  a  lucid  and
concise manner.
