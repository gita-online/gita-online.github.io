The Supreme Lord Krishna is explaining that He is in fact the <i>ksetrajnam</i>  or
cognizant consciousness abiding within all <i>jivas</i> or embodied  souls  in  its
capacity of vivifying all tenements in  <i>deva</i>  or  demigods,  human,  animal,
bird, fish etc. and all living entities who are <i>mad-atmakam</i> or  ensouled  by
Him and in possession of a  soul  and  not  those  artificially  created  or
cloned who are without an <i>atma</i> or  eternal  soul.  The  adverb  <i>api</i>  meaning
furthermore in the expression <i>capi mam viddhi</i> meaning know me  also,  infers
that the <i>ksetra</i> is also under Lord Krishna's complete control as  well.  The
actual purport is that just as the <i>ksetra</i> or physical  body  is  apprehended
solely as the inseparable adjunct of the <i>ksetra-jna</i> which is  designated  as
the <i>atma;</i> by the law of correlation of subject and  predicate  so  are  both
the <i>ksetra</i> and the <i>ksetra-jna</i> of all  sentient  beings  in  creation  to  be
understood as being inseparable adjuncts to the Supreme  Lord  Krishna.   It
will be pointed out subsequently that <i>Parabrahman</i> who is the  actual  source
of the <i>brahman</i> or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence  and  who
is  known  as  Vasudeva  an  expansion  of  Lord  Krishna  is  a  distinctly
transcendental postulate of existence  separate  from  even  the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>
which is the <i>atma</i> and this is totally independent of the <i>jiva</i> in a state  of
<i>moksa</i> or <i>baddha</i> being liberation and bondage  respectively  which  are  also
known by <i>kshara</i> or unliberated perishable souls  and  <i>akshara</i>  or  liberated
imperishable souls. Later in chapter 15 verses 16, 17 and  18  Lord  Krishna
confirms that there are two kinds of <i>atmas</i> in this world  the  fallible  and
the infallible. The fallible refers to the <i>kshara</i> and is the  sum  total  of
all unliberated souls in existence the infallible refers to the <i>akshara</i>  and
is the eternal, infinite and sovereign <i>param?tm?</i> or the Supreme  Soul  which
enters into all beings and sustains them. Since the Supreme  Lord  surpasses
the <i>kshara</i> and even excels the <i>akshara</i> as well He is  known  as  <i>Purusottama</i>
the Supreme Personality.
<p>
The <i>ksetra</i> is the composite of the material elements of earth,  water,  air,
fire and ether. The <i>ksetra-jna</i> comprises the spiritual bodies of  all  souls
in existence which qualitatively constitute the transcendental body  of  the
Supreme Lord Krishna who is the Supreme Soul of  all.  The  following  Vedic
scripture confirms: The Brihad-aranyaka Upanisad  V.VII.III  beginning   <i>yah</i>
<i>prithivyam tishthan</i> meaning : Who is situated  in  the  Earth,  who  is  the
interior of the Earth, whom the Earth knows not,  to  who  the  Earth  is  a
body, who rules the Earth from within, such a one is He the  <i>atma,</i>  eternal,
immortal and sovereign. Further in the same scripture  V.VII.XXII  beginning
<i>ya atmani tishthan</i> meaning:  Who  is  situated  in  the  <i>atma,</i>  who  is  the
interior of the <i>atma,</i> whom the <i>atma</i> knows not, to whom the <i>atma</i> is  a  body,
who rules the <i>atma</i> from within, such a one is He as  <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme
Soul eternal, immortal and sovereign.
<p>
Reference to the Supreme Lord in terms of <i>ksetra-jnam</i> etc. are justified  in
acccordance with the law of correlation of subject and  predicate  evidenced
before with the predicate signifying the abidance of  the  Supreme  Lord  as
the <i>ksetrajnam</i> within all <i>ksetra-jna's</i> as the <i>paramatma</i> within  all  <i>atma's,</i>
internally monitoring and governing at all times  all  beings  in  existence
everywhere throughout all creation. This law  of  correlation  was  evidence
earlier in chapter ten verse 20 where Lord Krishna reveals that  He  is  the
<i>atma</i> situated within the etheric heart of all <i>jivas</i> or embodied  beings.  In
verse 21 He proclaims that of the 12 Adityas, He is Vishnu. In verse  39  He
declares that nothing in all creation  which  moves  or  is  stationary  can
exist without Him and in verse 42 validates that He maintains and  energizes
the complete creation  and  total  cosmic  manifestation  with  but  a  mere
fraction of His  expansion.   So  with  this  clearly  in  mind  one  should
comprehend that the Supreme Lord Krishna highly  esteems  as  worth  knowing
the knowledge concerning the distinction between the <i>ksetra</i> and the  <i>ksetra-</i>
<i>jna</i> and the knowledge that Lord  Krishna  is  the  <i>atma</i>  of  all  beings  in
existence.
<p>
Contrarily some scholars and pandits interpret this  verse  of  knowing  the
<i>ksetrajna</i> to be  the Supreme Lord as a means to establish unity by the  rule
of common reference. In this case having to expound upon a united  existence
they postulate that the Supreme Lord is  seen  as  the  <i>ksetrajna</i>  by  which
through ignorance duality of the cognizant  and  the  incognizant  which  is
implied  has to be acknowledged and that the  inculcation  of  unity  is  to
dispel this ignorance. The explanation given is that the  ignorance  arising
from the dualistic  conception  of  the  <i>ksetra-jna</i>  is  dispelled  by  such
instructors interpretations of the wisdom emanating from the  mouth  of  the
Supreme Lord Himself the same as the instructor  who  teaches  that  a  rope
touched in the darkness is  not  a  snake  and  causes  the  imagined  snake
disappears. Such interpretations must be seriously questioned  as  to  their
veracity.
1) If the instructor who teaches the unequivocal wisdom  emanating  directly
from the Supreme Lord Himself in any of His  incarnations  or  expansions
and fully understands them,  then  there  is  no  question  of  ignorance
arising from dualistic conceptions as they are dispelled at the root  and
<i>atma tattva</i> or soul realization is soon forthcoming.
2) If the instructor whose ignorance supposedly has been  dispelled  on  the
dawning of <i>atma tattva</i> to then imagine that which is purely spiritual and
<i>nirvesa</i> or without material qualities and which is pure consciousness and
postulate it to be a  contrary  reflection  of  dualistic  antithesis  is
highly objectionable in the same way as considering  rain  and  water  as
dualistic.
3) If the instructor adheres to the  dualistic  conception  of  the  Supreme
Lord does not perceive Him as the one  absolute,  omnipotent,  omniscient
and omnipresent reality perpetually manifest in all creation then  it  is
obvious that <i>atma  tattva</i>  has  not  consummated  and  been  achieve  and
therefore His ignorance has not been dispelled. Therefore those  who  are
in ignorance themselves have no qualification to impart  knowledge of the
<i>atma</i> or eternal soul to others because they have not realized it either.
<p>
In chapter four, verse  34  Lord  Krishna  states:  <i>upadeksyanti  te  jnanam</i>
<i>jnaninas tattva-darsinah</i> meaning saintly souls endowed with  the  wisdom  of
divine revelation will impart  spiritual  knowledge.  So  in  conclusion  it
should be succinctly comprehended that all polemics  of  this  nature  which
are  opposed  to  the  <i>siddhanta</i>  or  conclusive  truth  of  all  the  Vedic
scriptures as well as logic and  reason  and  which  instead  ostentatiously
imposes a degraded and erroneous hypothesis upon the world deserves  not  to
be further addressed.
<p>
The factual reality of existence is found in the evidence and  proofs  found
in Vedic scriptures which confirm distinctive  characteristics of :
1) the experienced which is inherent deep within the nature of <i>acit</i> or  non-
sentient matter
2) the experiencer which is inherent  deep  within  the  nature  of  <i>cit</i>  or
consciousness
<i>3) paramesvaram</i> or the supreme controller inherent within every particle  of
creation
<p>
The Vedic scriptures themselves declare this as  reality  as  the  following
examples illustrate from the Svetasvatara Upanisad. In verse V.IX  beginning
<i>asman mayi srijate  visvam</i>  means  that  from  matter  the  illusory  nature
constructs the creation. In verse V.X  beginning  <i>mayantu  prakritim  vidyan</i>
<i>mayinam tu maheshvaram</i> means that the illusory energy to  be  verily  matter
which the Supreme Lord  is  far  beyond.  In  verse  I.X  beginning  <i>ksharam</i>
<i>pradhanam amritaksharam</i> means that which is perishable is  matter  and  that
which is imperishable is the eternal soul and that which rules both  is  the
Supreme Lord. In verse VI.II beginning <i>sa kara  jam  karapadhipadhipo</i>  means
the Supreme Lord is the cause, He is the Lord of matter, He is the  Lord  of
the soul, there is no other god above Him, He is the supreme  ruler  of  all
matter and all souls. In verse I.VI beginning <i>prithag atmanam preitaram</i>  and
means the soul and the Supreme Lord  are  distinct  and  different  whom  by
serving the soul achieves immortality. In  verse  I.IX  beginning  <i>jnanajnau</i>
<i>dvav-ajav-isanisau</i> means the Supreme Lord is  the  omniscient  one  and  the
soul is not, both are eternal but only the Supreme Lord  is  the  controller
of all. In verse I.XII beginning <i>bhokta bhogya  preritaram</i>  means  one  must
have knowledge of matter, the soul and the Supreme Lord.  In  verse  VI.XIII
beginning <i>nityo nityanam</i> means the Supreme Lord is the eternal Lord  of  all
souls, the Supreme  of  the  Supreme,  who  bequeaths  desires.  In  Mundaka
Upanisad  III.I.I  beginning  <i>tayor  anyah  pippalalm  svadvatti</i>  means  the
individual soul reaps the results of actions while the Supreme Soul    reaps
not and illuminates everywhere. In the  Taittiriya  Upanisad  X.V  beginning
<i>ajam ekam lohita-sukla-krsnam</i> means verily a unliberated  <i>jiva</i>  or  embodied
being embraces material existence in the form of  matter  and  enjoys  light
and water and food and in answer to one's wishes  bestows  manifold  progeny
while a  liberated  <i>jiva</i>  discards  material  existence  after  tasting  its
delights. Also in  the  Tattiriya  Upanisad  XI.I  beginning  <i>patim  visvasy</i>
<i>atmesvaram sasvatam</i> means the Supreme Lord is the Lord of all creation,  the
Lord of all souls, eternal  and  everlasting.  Again  in  the  Svestasvatara
Upanisad IV.VII beginning <i>samane vrikshe purusho nimagno</i> means  dwelling  in
the same field of activity as  <i>paramatma</i>  the  Supreme  Soul,  the  <i>atma</i>  or
individual soul immersed  in  the  machinations  of  material  existence  is
suffering greatly oblivious; but  when  the  <i>atma</i>  perceives  <i>paramatma</i>  the
worshipable Supreme Lord's localized manifestation in all its  glory  within
the etheric heart of  all  living  entities.  completely  transcendental  to
material nature, above and beyond the machinations  of  material  existence;
then all suffering ceases.
<p>
The Supreme Lord is <i>pradhana-ksetrajnam-patir  gunesah</i>  meaning  He  is  the
lord of all attributes and qualities in all fields of activity. Many  verses
spoken by Lord Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita corroborate this. Such as in  VII.IV
beginning <i>bhumir apo'nalo vayuh</i> referring to His eight fold energies of  the
material energy. In VII. 5 beginning <i>apareyam itas  te  anyam</i>  referring  to
the <i>atma</i> or soul and His superior spiritual energies. In  IX.VII   beginning
<i>sarva bhutani kaunteya</i> explaining how  all  living  entities  are  retracted
back into His nature and later distinctly  created  and  emitted  again.  In
IX.VIII beginning <i>prakrtim svam avastabhya</i> He continues explaining  how  His
agency of material nature manifests the <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied  entities  again
and again millennium after millennium according to their <i>karma</i> or  reactions
to their actions.  In  IX.X  beginning  <i>mayadhyaksena  prakrtih</i>  he  further
explains how His <i>sakti</i> or feminine potency creates all  things  mutable  and
immutable and thus creation is manifest again and again.  Then  in  XIII.IXX
beginning <i>prakrtim purusam</i> He will confirm the eternality  of  the  <i>atma</i>  or
soul and that material nature is without  beginning  and  later  in  XIV.III
beginning <i>mama yonir mahad-brahma</i> He explains  that  the  complete  material
existence is the womb wherein  He  germinates  all  souls  that  exist  from
Brahma to the lowest one-celled living entity and impels  their  birth  into
being. The <i>yoni</i> or womb is the vast cosmic  manifestation  and  <i>prakriti</i>  is
the supra-subtle material substratum pervading physical existence  which  is
<i>achit</i> or unconscious and inanimate.  Into  this  the  Supreme  Lord  by  His
glance projects the infinitesimal embryonic seed which is <i>chit</i> or  conscious
and animate. Thereafter by His will they are united  and  by  this  compound
alone all living beings created from matter are brought into existence  from
the highest demi-god to lower then a one-celled amoeba are  al  embodied  in
various corporeal and subtle  bodies.  The  word  <i>brahma</i>  or  the  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence denotes the primal  root  source  of  all
elements and is evidenced in the Vedic  scripture  Mundaka  Upanisad  I.I.IX
beginning  <i>tasmad  etat  brahma</i>  meaning  by  the  Supreme  Lords  will  the
unmanifested cosmic creation and the manifested cosmic creation arise.
<p>
Similarly other Vedic scriptures  solemnly  declare  that  the  animate  and
inanimate of <i>chit</i> and <i>achit</i> and all conditions existing in relation  to  the
experience and the experiencer both constitute the transcendental  spiritual
body of the Supreme Lord and subject  to  His  will  relate  to  Him  in  an
indissoluble dependent  and  subservient  position  eternally  and  that  an
infinitesimal portion of  the  Supreme  Lord  is  present  as  the  <i>atma</i>  or
immortal soul within all living entities. Thus the Supreme Lord is the  root
cause and underlying basis  for  everything  in  existence  and  all  living
entities in both spiritual and material.
<p>
References  from  other  Vedic  scriptures  confirming  this  are  given  as
follows. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad V.VII.III beginning  <i>yah  prithviyam</i>
<i>tisthan</i> meaning: Who is seated in the Earth. Whom the Earth  knows  not.  To
whom the Earth is the body. Who from inside of the Earth rules.  It  is  the
Supreme Soul, the ruler of  all,  immortal.  Commencing  thus  in  the  same
Upanisad in verse  V.VII.XXII  beginning  <i>ya  atmani  tisthan</i>  meaning:  Who
seated in the soul. Whom the soul knows not. To whom the soul is  the  body.
Who from inside of the soul rules. He is the  Supreme  Soul,  the  ruler  of
all, immortal. In  chapter  seven  of  the  Subala  Upanisad  we  find  many
examples beginning with: <i>yah prithivim antare sancharan</i> meaning: Who  moving
in the interior of the Earth. To whom Earth is the body. To whom  the  Earth
knows not; and y<i>o aksaram  antare  sancharam</i>  meaning:  Who  moving  in  the
interior of the soul. Whom the soul is the body. Whom the  soul  knows  not;
and <i>yo  mrityum  antare  sancharan</i>  meaning:  who  moving  in  the  material
substratum. To whom the material substratum is the body. Whom  the  material
substratum knows not; and <i>esa sarva bhut  antar  atma</i>  meaning  the  Supreme
Lord is the Supreme Soul of all beings, immortal,  immaculate,  divine.  The
term <i>mrityu</i> quoted  above  refers  to  the  subtle  state  of  the  material
substratum within inanimate objects and substances known by the  appellation
<i>tamas</i> or darkness. In chapter two of the Subala Upanisad beginning  <i>avaktyam</i>
<i>aksara</i> meaning  the  unmanifest    merges  into  the  imperishable  and  the
manifest merges into <i>tamas.</i> 
In the Tattiriya Aranyaka III.X  beginning  <i>antah  pravishta  sasta  jananam</i>
meaning: Existing within all, the ruler of all creatures, the  Supreme  Soul
pervades all.
<p>
Now will be given references from  other  Vedic  scriptures  as  well  which
confirm and explicitly express the truth that the Supreme Lord alone is  the
subject, predicated by the compounded bodies  of  all  sentient  beings  and
insentient elements existing in every condition and that  the  Supreme  Lord
is solely existent as the potential and as the actual manifestation  of  all
creation.  In  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  V1.II.I  beginning  <i>sad  eva  somya</i>
meaning: This <i>sat</i> or eternal existence  of  the  Supreme  Lord  was  in  the
beginning all there was; and in VI.II.III beginning <i>tad aikshata bahu  shyam</i>
meaning: The Supreme Lord willed that He  become  many  and  multiplied  and
manifested illumination; and in VI.VIII.VI beginning  <i>san  mulas  somy  emas</i>
<i>sarvam</i> meaning:  Eternal  existence  of  the  Supreme  is  the  root  source
manifesting  all  creation  and  its  support  and   maintenance;   and   in
VI.VIII.VII beginning <i>aitad atmyam idam  sarvam</i>  meaning:  All  creation  is
ensouled by the eternal existence of the  Supreme  Lord.  In  the  Tattiriya
Upanisad II.VI.II beginning <i>so kama yata bahusyam</i> meaning: The Supreme  Lord
willed may I be manifold and  meditating  thus  He  expanded  creation  with
unlimited  beings  also  in  II.VI.III  of  the   aforementioned   scripture
beginning <i>satyan chanritali ca</i> meaning: Both the eternal  soul  as  well  as
perishable matter emanate from the ultimate truth of the Supreme Lord.  This
confirms what  has  been  described  in  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.III.II
beginning <i>hanta ham imas tisro devatas</i> and means: The Supreme  Lord  as  the
Supreme Soul interpenetrates all existence  and  material  principles  being
fire, earth, air, water and ether as well as manifesting  names  and  forms.
This clearly illustrates the distinct  differences  between  <i>cit</i>  being  the
<i>atma</i> or eternal soul, <i>acit</i> being perishable  matter  and  <i>Isvara</i>  being  the
Supreme Lord. The Taittiriya Upanisad  II.VI.II  beginning  <i>tat  sristi  tva</i>
declares: After creating the complete cosmic manifestation comprised of  all
things sentient and insentient and permeating all  things  sentient  as  the
<i>atma</i> or eternal soul and all things insentient as  their  eternal  subatomic
essence. One being constant and immutable and the other being  variable  and
mutable both being separate manifestations of the Supreme Lord.
<p>
With the consensus of the preceding  Vedic  references   agreeing  that  the
Supreme Lord  is  manifesting  both  the  conscious  imperishable  soul  and
unconscious perishable matter with  the  embodiment  of  both  as  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied beings; it can be ascertained that the principle being  established
throughout is the reality of immanent co-existence between  the  omnipresent
<i>atma</i> and unlimited living entities. The manifestation of all  the  unlimited
names and forms by the  Supreme  Lord  is  confirmed  in  the  Brhadaranyaka
Upanisad III.IV.VII  beginning  <i>taddhedam  tarhi</i>  meaning:  Before  all  was
unmanifest and later it was subsequently  manifested  by  the  Supreme  Lord
into names and forms.
<p>
Thus it is established and clarified that the  Supreme  Lord  alone  is  the
originator of all whatever is <i>chit</i> or  conscious  and  animate  as  well  as
whatever is <i>achit</i> or unconscious and inanimate. He alone  is  the  principle
of cause when both <i>chit</i> and <i>achit</i> are unmanifest in an imperceptible  supra-
subtle state and He alone is the principle of effect when they are  manifest
in a perceptible physical state. Therefore identifying the Supreme  Lord  as
the sole source of  everything and its ancillary causes and effects one  can
then comprehend that knowledge of Him is knowledge of  both  and  that  only
knowledge of the Supreme  Lord  is  complete  knowledge.  In  the  Chandogya
Upanisad VI.III.II mentioned  previously  beginning  <i>hanta  ham  imas  tisro</i>
<i>devatas</i> the word <i>hanta</i> refers to the life force of  the  Supreme  Soul.  The
word <i>devatas</i> refers to the three  states  consisting  of  1)  everything  in
masse that is <i>achit</i> or unconscious in substance, 2) all  <i>jivas</i>  or  embodied
beings in whatever form they possess gross or subtle and 3) <i>atma</i>  being  the
immortal soul is a direct infinitesimal spark of the Supreme  Lord  Himself.
By understanding this it is evident that all names  are  sound  symbols  and
have a direct relationship to the  Supreme  Lord  activated  by  matter  and
spirit or body and soul. Hence the rule of identity of  substance  with  its
adjuncts finds its primary application in terms corrollating to the  Supreme
Lord as cause and such appellations give reference and  signifies  His  mode
as the source of effect as well. Since the <i>brahman</i> or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence, being a direct manifestation of  the  Supreme  Lord
is the cause containing both the <i>atmas</i> and matter in their subtle state;  as
well as the effect  containing  both  body  and  spirit  in  their  physical
manifestation; the <i>brahman</i> can be said to  be  the  cause  of  the  material
manifestation of creation.  Although  the  <i>brahman</i>  may  be  considered  the
material cause, the <i>brahman</i> is not in any  way  material  and  there  is  no
intermingling or sharing of the essences of the <i>brahman</i> with matter  or  the
<i>atma.</i> An example is a piece of colored cloth,  the  material  cause  is  the
combination of multicolored threads yellow, blue  and  red  running  through
it. Although the cloth is considered as a single substance constituted as  a
whole, the qualities of the different colored threads are  confined  to  the
area of the cloth where they occur. In the same manner when the compound  of
matter, the <i>atma</i> and the <i>brahman</i> is declared to be the material  cause,  the
effect of this cause is  the  material  creation.  So  their  should  be  no
confusion concerning the distinctive  characteristics  of  the  experiencer,
the  experieince,  or  the  controller  of  all  being   three   distinctive
principles combining to  manifest  the  entire  cosmos  and  correlating  to
produce the effect of  matter,  soul  and  Supreme  Lord.  Yet  there  is  a
difference between the colored cloth because all of the threads are able  to
be separated; whereas matter and the soul in all  ways  and  all  conditions
constitute the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord. It is a  case  where
the indiscernible attributive character  of  matter  and  the  imperceptible
nature of the <i>atma</i> or eternal soul as essences are  integral  parts  of  the
transcendental substantive qualities of  the  Supreme  Lord  as  a  compound
unit. Thus the Supreme Lord alone is  both  the  cause  and  effect  of  the
conscious <i>atma</i> as well as insentient matter and it is  He  alone  upon  whom
every verbal symbol and annotation ultimately connotes.
<p>
As  for  the  differences  in  the   components   of   the   Supreme   Lords
manifestations and their non-interchangeable  natures  the  analogy  of  the
separate threads of colored cloth  is  applicable.  When  this  is  properly
understood it is evident that the cause of all causes is the   Supreme  Lord
Krishna and although as the source of all He enters His components into  the
effects there is no transformation of His essential essence  and  never  any
transmutation of His transcendental immutable nature. That He is the  effect
as well is understandable by  He being the cause of the effect,  for  effect
is actually the cause in a modified form. The contention  that  the  Supreme
Lord is <i>nirguna-vada</i> or devoid of qualities  is  only  valid  and  justified
when referring to material qualities. Another example is  when  the  Supreme
Lord is said to be immaculate or devoid of any sin. This does  not  preclude
that the Supreme  Lord  is  without  transcendental  attributes  and  divine
qualities  it  is  just  that  His  attributes  and  qualities  are   purely
spiritual. The Vedic scriptures confirm  this.  In  the  Chandogya  Upanisad
VIII.I-V beginning <i>apa hata papana</i> meaning: The Supreme  Lord  is  destitute
of sin, affliction, hunger, thirst,  decrepitude  and  death.  In  the  same
passage beginning <i>satya kamas satya sankalpah</i> meaning: The Supreme  Lord  is
without  desires,  self-sufficient,  of  infallible  will  and   indomitable
nature. So after expunging the lack of  material  deficiencies  the  virtues
are expounded, affirmatively establishing the correct  context  of  what  is
written in various Vedic scriptures about  being  devoid  of  qualities  and
that this factually means devoid of any material qualities.
<p>
Next the discrepancy that the <i>brahman</i> or spiritual substratum pervading  all
existence is not a conscious entity of the Supreme Lord  who  is  completely
omniscient and omnipotent and who is endowed with all superlative  qualities
and sublime attributes of goodness and is the  antithesis  to  all  that  is
negative  and  evil  which  is  defined  by   the   primary   attribute   of
consciousness  which  exclusively  categorises  Him   and   His   authorised
incarnations as being Self-Illuminated. The Vedic  scriptures  confirm  this
such as: The Mundaka Upanisad II.II.VII  beginning  <i>yas  sarvajnas</i>  meaning:
The Supreme Lord is omniscient and all knowing.  The  Svetasvatara  Upanisad
IV.VIII beginning <i>para sya sakti</i> meaning: The transcendental nature  of  the
Supreme Lord is manifold and also  are  His  divine  attributes  of  wisdom,
power  and  activities.  The  Brihadaranya  Upanisad   IV.IV.XIV   beginning
<i>vijnataram are</i> meaning By His transcendental qualities the Supreme  Lord  is
to be known and proclaims Him as the  most  conscious  of  all  beings.  The
Tattiriya Upanisad II.I.I beginning <i>satyam jnanam</i> meaning: The Supreme  Lord
is truth, wisdom and consciousness this is proclaimed by His  being  defined
as  the  ultimate  expression  of  truth  and  wisdom   and   the   ultimate
consciousness fully  self-effulgent.  In  the  Tattiriya  Upanisad  II.VI.II
beginning <i>sa kamayata</i> meaning:  The  Supreme  Lord  willed  that  He  become
unlimitedly manifold. In the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.II.III  beginning  <i>tad</i>
<i>aikshata</i> meaning The Supreme Lord contemplated that  He  expand  and  become
unlimitedly  multitudinous.  In  the  Brihadaranyaka   Upanisad   III:IV:VII
beginning  <i>tanama  rupa  bhyam</i>  meaning:  The  Supreme  Lord  fashioned  the
manifold into names and forms. Again in the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad  VI.V.VI
beginning  <i>atmani  khalv-are</i>  meaning:  When  the  eternal  soul  within  is
perceived, experienced, witnessed, meditated upon and  understood  then  all
becomes known. Again  in  the  Brihadaranyaka  Upanisad  VI.V.VII  beginning
<i>sarvam tam paradat</i> meaning: All that is witnessed is to be  rejected  except
the witnessing of the eternal  soul  within.  Again  in  the  Brihadaranyaka
Upanisad VI.V.XI beginning <i>tasya ha</i> meaning: What is the  Rig  Vedas  except
verily the breath of the Supreme Lord.

This reveals that  the  Supreme  Lord  alone  is  <i>parabrahman</i>  the  Ultimate
consciousness  permeating the spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence
and by His  self-will  alone  He  is  existent  in  all  forms  movable  and
immovable. Certainly it is impossible for  any  type  of   consciousness  or
existence singular or manifold to  manifest  without  the  <i>brahman</i>  and  the
eternal soul. There is absolutely  no  variation  or  configuration  of  any
sentient being that could  exist  without  the  <i>atma</i>  or  eternal  soul  and
likewise nothing insentient can  exist  without  the  <i>brahman</i>  or  spiritual
substratum pervading all existence. This is declared and  confirmed  in  the
Vedic scriptures that follow. In the Brihadaranayaka Upanisad IV.IV.XIX  and
also the Katha Upanisad IV.X:XI beginning <i>mrityos sa  mrityum</i>  meaning:  Who
perceives in the <i>brahman</i> the lack of diversity deserves to die and be  bound
in  <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death.  Again   in   the
Brihadaranyaka Upanisad VI.IV.XIX beginning <i>neha nana asti</i> meaning:  Nowhere
in the <i>brahman</i> is there  limited  diversity.  Again  in  the  Brihadaranyaka
Upanisad beginning <i>yatra hi dvaitam</i> meaning: Although  in  the  <i>brahman</i>  may
appear to be duality. And finally in  the  Brihadaranyaka  Upanisad  VI.V.XV
beginning <i>tad itana itaram</i> meaning: All appears separate  to  one  who  does
not see the soul but to one who sees the  soul  all  is  seen.  Nor  is  the
multitudinous of forms manifesting from the <i>brahman</i> alone  as  is  confirmed
in such Vedix scriptures as  the   Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.II.III  beginning
<i>bahu syam prajayoga</i> meaning: May I be multitudinous, may I procreate,  which
affirms the reality that  the  Supreme  Lords  by  His  own  will  manifests
unlimited names and forms through His potency of the <i>brahman.</i>
<p>
So it can be comprehended that the Vedic scriptures have established that:
1) The essential difference between the  Supreme  Lord  and  <i>brahman,</i>  <i>chit,</i>
<i>achit</i> and <i>atma.</i>
2) The qualitative differences amongst them.
3) The law of cause and effect.
4) The relativity of cause and effect.
<p>
Thus it can be realized that a comprehensive  harmony  is  existing  amongst
all the Vedic scriptures by the Vedic scriptures  themselves  and  there  is
not the least contradiction to one who has received  the  knowledge  of  the
Vedas from the bonafide spiritual master  in  one  of  the  four  authorised
sampradaya's revealed in Vedic scriptures. Nor is  there  any  necessity  to
hypothecate contrary conclusions or erroneous suppositions such as  <i>brahman-</i>
<i>ajana-vada</i> or duality of the <i>brahman</i> due to ignorance  which  was  Sankara's
false contention and  <i>aupadhior  ka-brahma-bheda-vada</i>  meaning  the  <i>brahman</i>
becomes dualistic because of limiting conditions which was Bhaskara's  false
contention. So in conclusion let us take leave of such faulty  tenets  based
on fallacy and which are  opposed  to  the  reality  of  the  eternal  Vedic
scriptures.
