The complete cosmic creation constituted of variegated  myriad  of  sentient
and insentient beings is permeated by the Supreme Lord  Krishna.  The  words
<i>avyakta-murttina</i>  mean  His  subtle  form  manifested  as  the  <i>brahman</i>   or
spiritual substratum pervading all existence. It  is  indiscernible  by  the
material senses and  is  unable  to  be  perceived  by  the  mind.  Although
secretly hidden, He is manifested internally in the unrivalled  presence  of
<i>paramatma</i> the purely spiritual  supreme  soul  in  everything  sentient  and
insentient. So in spirit He pervades everywhere. Lord Krishna does  this  in
relation to universal creation as the Supreme Sovereign Lord manifesting  it
and also by maintaining and sustaining it. As stated in  the  Brihadaranyaka
Upanisad V.VII.III beginning <i>ya prithivyam tishtham</i>  or  He  who  abides  in
earth but whom earth knows not and He to whom in the interior  of  earth  is
sovereign ruler  and  in  verse  V.VII.XXII  beginning  <i>ya  atmani  tishtham</i>
meaning He who resides in the soul but the soul knows not  and  He  to  whom
the soul is the body who from the interior of the soul is  sovereign  ruler.
Both verses confirm His supreme presence and pervasive nature in  everything
which is sentient  as  well  as  insentient;  but  totally  unperceived.  By
reference to earth,  body,  soul  establishes  complete  compliance  to  His
sovereign rulership and establishes the dependence of all  things  upon  Him
as they derive their very existence  from  Him.  Hence  all  existences  and
everything existing in all existences have their abode  within  the  Supreme
Lord.
