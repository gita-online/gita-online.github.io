As in reality the Supreme Lord Krishna  is  the  father  of  all,  the  best
friend of all and the most  beloved  of  all,  being  the  most  exalted  He
possesses most fully the qualities of mercy, compassion, kindness and  other
virtues. Thinking in this way Arjuna prostrates the full length of his  body
upon the ground in humble supplication beseeching the Supreme Lord to  smile
upon him in benevolent grace. Although the son may make an indiscretion  the
father may  condemn,  still  the  father  will  reconcile  himself  to  him.
Although a friend has defects another  friend  will  magnanimously  overlook
them. Although the beloved is sometimes contrary the  lover  will  not  hold
this against  the  beloved  when  asked  to  be  forgiven.  As  harmony  and
benignity is normally  established  as  a  result  of  humble  supplication,
Arjuna is imploring  the  Supreme  Lord  to  be  merciful,  magnanimous  and
forgiving.
