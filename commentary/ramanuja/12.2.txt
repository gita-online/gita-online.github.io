The words <i>avesya manah</i> means focusing  the  mind  and  includes  fixing  the
heart exclusively upon  Lord  Krishna  otherwise  if  it  is  not  exclusive
something else may enter in and  then  it  will  not  be  possible  for  the
Supreme Lord to be their only object of meditation. The word  <i>sraddha</i>  means
firm faith and those so endowed  eagerly  and  enthusiastically  strive  for
divine communion with the Supreme Lord. Those who  propitiate  Lord  Krishna
in this way with mind and hearts  absorbed  totally  in  Him  are  His  best
devotees and <i>yuktamamah</i> the most  superior  of  all  as  they  joyfully  and
skilfully with great eclat and  determination  navigate  themselves  swiftly
through the currents of life to attain eternal communion  with  the  Supreme
Lord.
