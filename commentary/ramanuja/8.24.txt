Time in this verse indicates the route where the presiding demigods over
the various time divisions from the day up to a year, reside in great
numbers. Their route is either that path going by which yogis or those
perfecting the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion
with the ultimate consciousness are not subject to rebirth; or that path
where persons of righteous deeds are born again. This last path Lord
Krishna is describing now. The mention of fire, illumination, day, waxing
moon and the suns six month sojourn on its waxing northern journey implies
the year as well.
