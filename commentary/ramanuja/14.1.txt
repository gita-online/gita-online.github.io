In  the  previous  chapter  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  explained  that  by
comprehending the factual relationships of <i>purusa</i> or the  Supreme  Being  as
<i>paramatma</i> the all pervading supreme soul, the  <i>atma</i>  or  the  immortal  soul
and <i>prakriti</i> or the material substratum pervading physical existence.  Along
with imbibing  the  virtues  beginning  in  verse  8  such  as  humilty  and
reverence and also by <i>bhaktir avyabhicarini</i> or  exclusive  devotion  to  the
Supreme Lord as given in verse 11 which awards His grace. By  doing  so  one
would achieve  <i>moksa</i> or freedom from material existence.
<p>
Now in this chapter the Lord Krishna propounds how the <i>gunas</i> or three  modes
of <i>sattva guna</i> or mode of goodness, <i>raja guna</i> or mode of  passion  and  <i>tama</i>
<i>guna</i> or mode of ignorance all individually and conjointly cause the <i>jiva</i>  or
embodied being to be bound to <i>samsara</i>  the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and
death and gives the remedy by  which  one  may  be  redeemed  and  delivered
therefrom. The word  <i>pravaksyami</i>  means  I  will  declare.  What  will  Lord
Krishna declare?  He  will  declare  <i>jnananam  jnanam  uttamam</i>  meaning  the
topmost knowledge and wisdom. What knowledge and wisdom is  this?  Knowledge
of  the three <i>gunas</i> whose qualities directly influence  the  combination  of
<i>prakriti</i> and <i>purusa</i> effected as the <i>jiva</i> or embodied being. What  wisdom  is
this? Wisdom that surpasses all that has previously  been  told  about  this
combination. The <i>munis</i>  are  the  great  sages  and  seers  or  <i>munayah</i>  who
possessing this wisdom  in  deep  meditation  achieve  self-realisation  and
release from <i>samsara</i> ascending to the supreme state. The excellence of  this
wisdom is extolled next.
