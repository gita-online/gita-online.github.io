The person who is neither in need of  <i>karma  yoga</i>  the  path  of  action  or
<i>jnana yoga</i> the path of cultivating spiritual knowledge is naturally one  who
is situated in <i>atma-tattva</i> or soul realisation. To such a  person  the  <i>atma</i>
or soul and the Supreme Lord are the only objects of attention  and  one  is
completely content within by them. No  satisfaction  that  is  felt  in  any
other situation  such  as  eating  delicious  foods  or  drinking  nectarian
beverages can compare with the satisfaction that  the  <i>atma</i>  gives.  Neither
beautiful scents, nor  beautiful  music  nor  the  experience  of  beautiful
panorama's can compare either with the bliss of the  <i>atma.</i>  To  that  person
whose focus,  whose  attention,  whose  inspiration,  whose  support,  whose
everything is emanating from  the  <i>atma.</i>  What  need  is  there  to  perform
prescribed Vedic activities to attain <i>atma-tattva</i>? Such a person is  already
situated in <i>atma-tattva</i> and has attained <i>moksa</i> or liberation from the  cycle
of birth and death in the material existence. So such a person has  no  need
to perform prescribed Vedic activities. Both <i>karma yoga</i> and <i>jnana  yoga</i>  are
paths for those whose minds need  to  be  diverted  and  directed  from  the
material illusion to the spiritual reality. But once one  who  has  achieved
<i>atma-tattva</i> there is no need  to  resort  to  any  external  assistance  any
longer. Any action such a one performs is not bound to the  material  nature
as cause and effect due  to  the  reality  that  such  a  person  is  always
performing every action while in blissful contemplation  and  meditation  on
the wonders of the <i>atma.</i> Performing  actions  in  this  state  is  easy  and
bereft of any danger as in the case of <i>jnana yoga</i> furthermore  sets  a  good
example for the welfare of the world  following  the  path  of  the  Supreme
Spirit in all beings. In this verse the word <i>karyam</i>  means  duty  bound  and
the word <i>asaktah</i> means unattached. So one should  perform  prescribed  Vedic
actions in <i>karma yoga</i> as a matter of duty without attachment to the  results
until <i>atma-tattva</i> is achieved. In this way <i>karma yoga</i> is  performed  without
ego centred conceptions of the self as the doer
<p>
Because <i>karma yoga</i>  is  recommended  even  to  those  in  <i>jnana</i>  <i>yoga  g</i>reat
Maharishi's and rulers of great wisdom such as  King  Janaka  also  achieved
<i>atma-tattva</i> and attained <i>moksa</i>  solely  by  <i>karma  yoga</i>  performing  actions
following the prescribed injunctions of the  Vedas.  This  illustrates  that
the aspirant for <i>moksa</i> who is not qualified to tread the path of <i>jnana  yoga</i>
can still achieve the highest attainment through <i>karma yoga.</i> Furthermore  it
has also been shown that there are some advantages in performing  prescribed
Vedic activities in <i>karma yoga</i> even for one qualified to tread the  path  of
<i>jnana yoga.</i> In the next verse another aspect of <i>karma yoga</i> will be shown  as
the inevitable duty of a specifically distinguished and qualified  class  of
people in society.
