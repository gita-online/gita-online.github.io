The virtuous war the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is  instructing  Arjuna  about
would be recorded in the Mahabharata as the Battle  of  Kuruksetra.  Because
it involves such great sacrifices of life it should be  regarded  as  within
the sphere of a <i>ksatriya</i>'s legitimate  duties  the  same  as  a  <i>Agnisomiyam</i>
which is the performance of sacrifice to Agni and Soma.  Understanding  that
it is to his merit as a <i>ksatriya</i> to fight this battle  Arjuna  can  have  no
cause for regret. According to the <i>ksatriya</i> code of ethics  no  infringement
has been enacted by Arjuna or his brothers the Pandava's and  so  <i>dharma</i>  or
righteousness is with them. There  is  no  action  more  meritorious  for  a
<i>ksatriya</i> then to fight for righteousness. The qualities to  be  found  in  a
<i>ksatriya</i> are heroism, exuberance,  determination,  resourcefulness,  bravery
in battle, generosity and leadership. That  those  slain  in  battle  obtain
illustrious heavenly bodies and win other rewards in  heavenly  spheres  has
already been mentioned.
