In as much as the last flash of consciousness of a dying  person  determines
a persons destination and specification  in  their  very  next  birth.  This
flash will naturally be  that  which   one  pondered  and  contemplated  and
became  accustomed  and  habituated  to  performing  as  a  daily  practice.
Therefore it is imperative that if one desires to achieve the ultimate  goal
of human existence they shall learn  about  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and
becoming attached to Him  unceasingly  meditate  upon  Him  until  the  very
moment of departure from this material existence at  the  moment  of  death.
Lord Krishna also advises with  the  words  <i>anusmara</i>  <i>yudhya</i>  meaning  fight
while remembering Him. This was applicable to Arjuna who was a  <i>ksatriya</i>  or
warrior from the royal line and it is his  duty  to  protect  righteousness.
But  it  also  applies  to  everyone  to  perform  their  prescribed  duties
according  to  the  injunctions  enjoined  in  the  Vedic  scriptures.  This
includes ones daily  duties  and  sometimes  special  occasional  duties  as
ordained by <i>varnasrama</i> or one's  position  and  rank  within  society.  Thus
while performing ones specific  duties  daily  adhering  and  following  the
ordinances of the Vedic scriptures one  should  meditate  upon  the  Supreme
Lord with every action one performs. In this  way  one  will  be  constantly
thinking of Him and perpetually He will be infused  in  ones  consciousness.
This is the most perfect and expedient way to succeed in  keeping  the  mind
and will fixed upon Lord Krishna and thus naturally at the moment  of  death
one who has meditated throughout their life on Him will of course easily  be
remembering Him at the final moment of departure from the physical body  and
will  immediately transcend to join Him  in  the  eternal  spiritual  worlds
according to their wish. There is no doubt about this whatsoever.

Lord Krishna having explained in general for everyone that  the  achievement
of a particular form and destination in the next life is determined  by  the
very last thought in this life, He will elucidate  the  different  modes  of
meditative devotion appropriate for each class and compatible with the  goal
they cherish to attain. First He will describe in the next  verse  the  type
of meditation practised by  the  <i>artharthis</i>  or  those  seeking  wealth  and
fortune as well as the type final thought adopted by  them  consistent  with
the mode of meditation they use.
