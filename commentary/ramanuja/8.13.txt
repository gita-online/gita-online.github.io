Systematically vibrating the singular syllable <i>OM</i> vibrated as A-U-M.  It  is
the personal sign, symbol and sound of the <i>aksaram</i> or  imperishable.  <i>OM</i>  is
the indicator and Lord  Krishna  is  the  indicated  Who  is  to  be  to  be
profoundly and humbly meditated upon. Whomsoever departs from this  life  at
the moment of death fixing the <i>prana</i> or life force in  the  crown  of  their
head in the manner so indicated  goes  to  the  exalted,  eternal  spiritual
worlds. The words <i>paramam gatim</i> mean  the  supreme  destination  from  where
there is no return granting <i>moksa</i> or liberation and includes <i>atma tattva</i>  or
realisation of the soul which is in essence comparable to the  Supreme  Lord
and contra distinguished from matter and everything material. More  evidence
of this will be given later in this chapter in verses  20  and  21.  So  the
method of meditation for those who are <i>atharthi</i> or seekers  of  fortune  and
for those who are <i>jijnansur</i> or those aspiring realisation of  the  soul  has
been duly given being similar. Next the method of divine  meditation  suited
for the <i>jnani</i> or the aspirant for the Supreme Lord and the nature  of  their
goal will be revealed.
