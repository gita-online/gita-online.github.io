The word <i>avidvamsah</i> means ignorant, the ignorance referred to is  all  those
who are not knowledgeable of <i>atma-tattva</i>  or  soul  realisation.  Those  who
have desires and are attached to performing actions to obtain the fruits  of
such desires are unable to approach the <i>jnana yoga</i>  or  the  cultivation  of
spiritual knowledge. Others being more sober are only fit  to  follow  <i>karma</i>
<i>yoga</i> the path of prescribed Vedic actions as their means  to  achieve  <i>atma-</i>
<i>tattva.</i> Let  the  wise  act  and  behave  like  one  performing  <i>karma  yoga</i>
performing prescribed Vedic actions even if they have  no  interest  in  the
results of their actions and are qualified for <i>jnana yoga</i> and even  if  they
have knowledge of <i>atma-tattva.</i> For such a person is naturally great  and  is
looked up to by all the world and should always  conduct  themselves  in  an
exemplary manner by performing  prescribed  Vedic  activities  according  to
qualification. By this mankind will be  cognisant  of  what  is  proper  and
improper in society. Actions of this nature can only be accomplished by  one
performing <i>karma yoga.</i>
<p>
The ignorant are conditioned to desires of fruitive activities  being  fully
attached to gaining results and are incapable of adopting the path of  <i>jnana</i>
<i>yoga</i> or the cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A person  of  wisdom  should
not unhinge the  minds  and  disturb  the  equilibrium  of  ordinary  people
pursuing their dreams of material acquisitions in <i>karma  yoga</i>  by  preaching
the superior path of <i>jnana yoga</i> which they are incapable of following.  What
a person of wisdom must do is set an example by their  actions  and  perform
prescribed Vedic activities in <i>karma yoga</i>  showing  the  ignorant  by  their
example that without desire and  being  unattached  to  the  results  it  is
sufficient to achieve <i>atma-tattva.</i> By setting the  example  in  this  manner
the  great souls inspires the whole society to perform righteous  activities
so that eventually their minds will be come purified of all dross  and  they
will become competent to advance in spiritual life and  attain  <i>atma-tattva.</i>
The difference between how a person of wisdom performs <i>karma  yoga</i>  and  how
the ignorant acts in <i>karma yoga</i> and the reason why will be explained in  the
next verse.
