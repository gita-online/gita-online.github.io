Continuing further Lord Krishna gives some precise insights to the  demoniac
mentality.
<i>1) Avastabhya</i> means indiscriminately adopting erroneously as in the verse
before.
<i>2) Nasta-atmanah</i> means devoid of any contact with their immortal soul. 
<i>3) Alpa-buddhaya</i> means limited intellect due to being incognizant of  the
cognizant.
<i>4) Ugra-karmanah</i> means vile, heinous, horrendous  activities  destructive
to all.
<p>
Such  creatures  are  demoniac  and  are   a   parasitic,   virulent   virus
destabilising all creation.
