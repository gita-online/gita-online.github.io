The <i>atma</i> or eternal soul never accepts anyone's sins  or  mitigate  anyone's
misery or suffering although the person may be dearly beloved. Nor does  the
<i>atma</i> take the pious merit and happiness which may come to a person  that  is
hated. The <i>atma</i> is transcendental to material nature and not limited to  the
physical body.  The  <i>atma</i>  knows  not  the  relationship  of  the  amity  of
friendliness nor the enmity of antagonism. All  conceptions  of  friend  and
foe are material designations caused by <i>vasana</i> which is  physical  instincts
created from material association. How then is it  that  the  <i>atma</i>  is  thus
shrouded by this  <i>vasana</i>.  Lord  Krishna  reveals  that  it  is  because  of
ignorance. It is ignorance which shrouds and obscures  spiritual  knowledge.
Ignorance and nescience is that which is opposed to spiritual knowledge  and
wisdom. By the shrouding of ignorance due to  reactions  from  past  actions
the  consciousness  of  the  <i>atma</i>  becomes  obscured  and  the  intelligence
compromised allowing the living entity to enter the perilous predicament  of
believing they are the enjoyer of the rewards of actions thereby  recipients
of the reactions. Thus by the <i>karma</i> or  the  reactions  from  attachment  to
actions one forges a material link in the appropriate  physical  body.  This
love of one's body forges  links  with  other  bodies  kindling  a  ironclad
infatuation for the bodily conception.  This  infatuation  maturing  becomes
<i>vasana</i> which constitutes  the  seed  for  further  births  in  the  material
creation.  This  perpetuates  more  and  more  actions  and  reactions   and
infatuations for bodily  connections  and  more  seeds  and  more  increased
<i>vasana</i> which perpetually keeps an embodied  being  locked  in  the  material
existence engendering unlimited  births  and  rebirths.  Next  Lord  Krishna
propounds the topic of spiritual intelligence.
