Completely devoid of all cravings for  the  rewards  of  one's  actions  and
endeavours even up to desiring entry to <i>svargaloka</i> or the heavenly  spheres.
Those who have indeed become accomplished in <i>karma yoga</i> or prescribed  Vedic
activities without desiring rewards simply let their body, mind  and  senses
perform their natural functions as  instruments  to  effect  <i>atma-suddhi</i>  or
self-purification which breaks the bonds of the past deeds  which  bind  the
<i>atma</i> to <i>samsara</i> or the cycle of  birth  and  death.  <i>Karma  yoga</i>  should  be
performed solely for this purpose and not for obtaining heavenly  enjoyments
in <i>svargaloka</i>.
