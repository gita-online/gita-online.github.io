The <i>sukham</i> or happiness of those who enjoy the objects  of  the  senses  and
take great pleasure in sense gratification Lord Krishna states  which  seems
like  nectar  in  the  beginning  but  which  in  the  end  after  incessant
repetition and habitual engagement seems to be just like a potion of  poison
when detected too late that such activities are a  guaranteed  premium  paid
reservation for <i>samsara</i> the perpetual cycle of birth and death  is  situated
in <i>raja guna</i> the mode of passion.
