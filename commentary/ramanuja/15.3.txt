The <i>jivas</i> or embodied beings immersed in <i>samsara</i> or the perpetual  cycle  of
birth and death are unable to comprehend this <i>asvattha</i> or  banyan  tree  and
its symbolism. It is impossible  for  them  to  understand  that  this  tree
symbolising material existence has its root above in  Satyloka  with  Brahma
and its branches descending downwards  are  all  the  innumerable  <i>jivas</i>  or
embodied  beings  throughout  all  of  creation  and  that  humans  are  its
terminals  from  where  there  are  branches  spreading  upwards   as   well
determined by  <i>karma</i>  or  reactions  to  actions  based  upon  following  or
ignoring the injunctions and prohibitions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  which
apply when one finally  achieves  a  human  form  out  of  the  millions  of
different plants, birds, fish and animal species. As a human one is  quickly
indoctrinated into <i>samsara</i> with the conceptions of I am. I am a man. I am  a
king. I am the son of this person. I am  the  wife  of  that  person.  I  am
beautiful. I am great, etc., etc. Such I am conceptions keeps one locked  in
<i>samsara</i> and causes one to  be  fully  occupied  with  mundane  concerns  and
worldly affairs appropriate to such  conceptions.  Such  persons  look  upon
their bodily conceptions as there very self  and  are  completely  oblivious
that they are factually eternal beings possessing an <i>atma</i> or immortal  soul.
They perceive not that they can gradually wean themselves from this  ancient
tree by renuciation of the three <i>gunas</i>  or  modes  of  material  nature  and
detachment from the objects of the senses. Neither do they  comprehend  that
the <i>atma</i> is seperate and distinct from  the  physical  body.  Nor  can  they
differentiate that the ego is not the physical body and the <i>atma</i> is not  the
ego. Bewildered by illusion they believe what is unreal to be real and  what
is real they cannot perceive. The origin and source is unfathomable to  them
and so deluded they remain in ignorance.
<p>
This <i>asvattha</i> tree with roots above and branches below that keeps  the  <i>jiva</i>
enslaved in <i>samsara</i> can only be destroyed by the sword of non-attachment  to
objects of the senses. This renunciation arises  from  <i>bhakti</i>  or  exclusive
loving devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna which is the  highest  good  and
apex of all to be attained by every  <i>jivas</i>  and  paramount  to  every  other
conceivable activity in existence throughout all  of  creation.  Demolishing
this strong and durable <i>asvattha</i> tree by  the  sharp  weapon  of  detachment
from sense objects produces  disike  and  disdain  for  sense  gratification
which creates a desire for pure, sublime spiritual  experiences  which  when
one attains can no longer be subjected to the influence of the  three  <i>gunas</i>
or  modes of  material  nature.  How  can  such  a  state  of  consciousness
manifest and detachment from the <i>gunas</i> which causes delusion be  guaranteed?

Lord Krishna has already  previously  confirmed  in  chapter  VII.VII:  That
there is nothing superior  to  Him.  In  chapter  VII.XIV:  That  those  who
surrender unto Him alone can surmount the three <i>gunas.</i>  In  chapter  IX,  X:
That material nature is operating under His control. In X.VIII: That  He  is
the origin and source of all material and spiritual worlds. So let  glorious
propitiation and  devotion be given unto the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  as  He
alone is the sole refuge of all living entities. Inasmuch  as  all  material
impressions, instincts and influences arise  from  contact  with  the  three
<i>gunas</i> proceeding from <i>prakriti</i> the material  substratum  pervading  physical
existence which is controlled byHim. It is logical  to  understand  that  by
Him they can also be transcended. The question that naturally comes to  mind
is  how?  The  word  <i>prapadye</i>  means  surrender.  In   VII.XIV   is   stated
<i>prapadyante</i> or have surrendered. In  this  verse  a  variant  is  stated  as
<i>prapadye yatah</i> which by the gramatical rules of Panini  can  be  interpreted
as <i>prapadye  iyatah</i>  meaning  by  a  mere  step  of  surrendering  unto  Him
spiritual impressions, instincts and influences are activated and awaken  in
such a one.  They  will  manifest  as  spontaneous  impulses  arising   with
frequency in the heart and dispel all nescience. They  are  ancient  because
they embody the collective consciousness of all the <i>mumukshas</i>  or  achievers
of <i>moksa</i> or liberation from material existence since  time  immemorial,  who
surrendered and took refuge of the Supreme Lord Krishna  or  His  authorised
incarnation and expansion as revealed in Vedic scriptures and were  released
forever from the bondage of <i>samsara.</i>
