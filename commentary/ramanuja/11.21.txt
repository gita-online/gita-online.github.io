The <i>cosmapas</i> equals <i>ca</i> and <i>usmapah</i> meaning the forefathers which  belong  to
group of beings known as the <i>pitris</i> or the deified ancestors. The  Taittirya
Upanisad I.X beginning <i>usma-bhagahi pitarah</i> meaning the  forefathers  belong
to the deified ancestors confirms this. Manu Samhita  CCLXXXIV  states  that
the deceased fathers are called Vasus, the deceased grandfathers are  called
Rudras and the deceased great-grandfathers are called Adityas.
