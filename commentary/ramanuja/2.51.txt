Performing actions as  prescribed  in  the  previous  verses  and  therefore
purged of all dross the realisation one attains  will  extricate  them  from
the perplexities of worldliness arising  from  identification  with  actions
and the reward of actions. From that point on  all  that  one  has  hitherto
heard regarding the wisdom of renouncing the rewards of action as the  cause
of motivation for action  as  well  as  what  one  would  subsequently  hear
regarding the fruitiveness of  actions  will  by  one's  own  free  will  be
regarded with complete indifference. What has thus far been given is in  the
next verse to be described. It is known as <i>yoga</i>  which  is  the  science  of
uniting the individual consciousness  with  the  ultimate  consciousness  by
actions  performed  with  the  light  of  spiritual  intelligence  based  on
bonafide knowledge of the immortal soul.
