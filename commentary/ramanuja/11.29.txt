The Supreme Lord Krishna manifested His <i>visvarupa</i> or divine  universal  form
of wonderful and terrible visage  to  exhibit  His  unlimited  and  absolute
sovereign power. Now that Arjuna's request of seeing the <i>visvarupa</i> has  been
granted he beseeches further to know Lord Krishna's  intention  and  purpose
for exhibiting it and he desires to know who Lord  Krishna  truly  is  apart
from the <i>visvarupa.</i> He addresses Lord Krishna as <i>deva-vara</i> meaning  Lord  of
all lords and  is  curious  as  to  the  reason  why  He  exhibited  to  His
surrendered <i>bhakta</i> or devotee the terrible  visages  with  many  mouths  and
teeth along with His wonderful form of cosmic glory. Arjuna is now  desiring
to see Lord Krishna's pleasing and charming, sublime  humanlike  form.  Lord
Krishna exhibited  His  all  powerful  <i>visvarupa</i>    to  show  Arjuna  in  no
uncertain terms that without any effort He will destroy all  the  kings  and
warriors that are arrayed in the Kaurava army and this does  not  depend  at
all  upon  Arjuna  and  the  Pandava  army.  Lord  Krishna  is  prepared  to
annihilate the  complete  Kaurava  army  if  need  be  and  to  assert  this
conviction He exhibited the terrible visages of the <i>visvarupa</i> is  to  remind
Arjuna of this.
