Lord Krishna consoles Arjuna telling him that he should let go of any
anxiety, fear or trepidation that may have bewildered and perplexed him
while witnessing His visvarupa or divine universal form in all its
terrifying splendour, for now Lord Krishna will reveal His four-armed four
which Arjuna was in the habit of seeing.
