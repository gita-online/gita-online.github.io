One who is tranquil and content with whatever spontaneously comes to one  of
its own accord to maintain one's existence is the being who has gone  beyond
the dualities of material existence. This means that such a being  patiently
endures pleasure and pain, acceptance and rejection, sadness  and  happiness
and the rest of the opposites which inevitably all mortals must  face  until
one attains the goal of their  endeavours  which  is  <i>atma  tattva</i>  or  soul
realisation.  The  word  <i>vimatsarah</i>  means  free  from   malice.   One   who
comprehends  that  only  due  to  one's  previous  activities  are   present
activities manifesting, such a one does not hold malice against  others  and
blaming them others for any  negative  reactions  one  may  experience.  The
compound words <i>siddhau-asiddhau samah</i> which means one who keeps  their  mind
balanced and  equipoised  in  success  or  failure  while  performing  their
duties. The essence of what Lord Krishna is saying is that if a  person  has
this mentality while  performing  activities  they  will  not  be  bound  to
<i>samsara</i> or the cycle of birth and death in material  existence  even  though
they are not fully following the path of <i>jnana yoga</i> or  the  cultivation  of
Vedic knowledge.
